Direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) are high flow lesions that can be challenging to treat. A number of recent reports suggest that flow diversion may be a viable treatment option. We present a case of a post-traumatic CCF successfully treated with flow diversion and provide a review of the literature. Our results suggest that flow diversion is a potentially effective treatment option for CCFs and is most successful when used as an adjunctive therapy.

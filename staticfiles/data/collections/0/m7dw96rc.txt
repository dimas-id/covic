Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is currently one of the most important pathogens in the poultry industry. The H120 and Ma5 are the only viral strains approved by the Brazilian government as the constituent of vaccines. Despite the systematic vaccination in Brazil, IBV has not yet been controlled and diseases associated with this virus have been reported in vaccinated chickens. Here, we investigated the genetic variability of H120 and Ma5 strains present in the IBV vaccines from different Brazilian manufacturers. We performed DNA sequencing analyses of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene to investigate its genetic variability and the presence of viral subpopulations among vaccines, between batches, and also in each vaccine after a single passage was performed in chicken embryonated eggs. Our results revealed up to 13 amino acid substitutions among vaccines and some of them were localized in regions of the S1 glycoprotein that play a role in virusâ€“host interaction. Secondary nucleotide peaks identified in the chromatogram for the S1 gene sequence revealed that all original vaccines (H120 and Ma5) were composed by different subpopulations of IBV. Moreover, new viral subpopulations were also found in vaccines after a single passage in chicken embryonated eggs. These findings indicate that H120 and Ma5 viral strains used in vaccines market in Brazil can still mutate very rapidly during replication, leading to amino acid substitutions in proteins involved in the stimulation of the immune response, such as the S1 glycoprotein. Therefore, our data suggest that the genetic variability of these viral strains should be taken into consideration to ensure an effective immune response against IBV.

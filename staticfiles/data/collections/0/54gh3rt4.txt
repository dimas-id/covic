Abstract Biosecurity on South American camelid operations involves both external and internal measures to prevent the introduction and spread of disease. External biosecurity involves practices and techniques directed at the prevention of entry of new diseases into a group of animals. Internal biosecurity or biocontainment, involves practices and techniques that are directed at the prevention or spread of disease within an existing group of animals. External biosecurity is particularly important in North America camelid operations due to the extensive movement of animals for breeding or show purposes. Internal biosecurity typically involves this the prevention and treatment of failure of passive transfer, maintenance of proper nutrition and housing, and the implementation of an appropriate vaccination program for endemic or relevant diseases. Attention to appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures related to housing, feeding, and treatment equipment is important for the maintenance of both internal and external biosecurity practices. This paper discusses various risk factors associated with the control of infectious disease in the context of external and internal biosecurity measures in camelids operations.

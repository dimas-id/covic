Recent attention to H1N1 influenza has increased awareness in the lay community of the seriousness of respiratory complications in the gravid patient. Historically, pneumonia during pregnancy has been associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality. Similarly, the increased number of pregnant patients with chronic medical illnesses, including diabetes, HIV, cardiac disease, and obesity may further complicate the clinical outcome in this population. Although data suggest that infants born to mother whose pregnancies have been complicated by pneumonia are more likely to be born preterm and to have a lower birth weight, care must be taken to balance treatment to serve both the mother and the fetus.

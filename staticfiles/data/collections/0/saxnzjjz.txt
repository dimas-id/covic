INTRODUCTION Single-port total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) has not been widely used because of its technical difficulty and steep learning curve, especially the laparoscopic suturing of the vaginal stump. Barbed suturing is a new technology that has the potential to greatly facilitate laparoscopic suturing. AIM To compare surgical outcomes and vaginal vault healing between barbed sutures and traditional sutures in the repair of the vaginal vault during single-port TLH. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between August 2013 and June 2015, we performed single-port TLH in 85 consecutive patients for benign or premalignant gynecological conditions. The first 48 patients underwent single-port TLH with traditional interrupted sutures, and the next 37 patients underwent single-port TLH with absorbable unidirectional knotless barbed sutures for repair of the vaginal vault. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, body mass index), procedures performed, uterine weight, and uterine disease were similar between the groups. There were no differences in blood loss, hemoglobin change, length of hospital stay, or perioperative complications. Operative time and the time required for vaginal cuff suturing were significantly shorter in the barbed suture group than in the traditional suture group (57.8 ±13.5 vs. 80.1 ±18.7 min, p < 0.001; 5.5 ±1.7 vs. 12.9 ±3.5 min, p < 0.001). Moreover, the use of barbed sutures significantly reduced the incidence of vaginal granulation tissue formation (2.7% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Use of barbed sutures in single-port TLH reduced the operative time, suturing time of the vaginal vault, and formation of vaginal granulation tissue. Barbed suturing may help overcome surgical difficulties and vaginal cuff complications.

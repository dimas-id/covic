We present a case of pericardial effusion due to embolization of a fragment of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, with subsequent perforation of the right ventricle. This is a rare and unexpected cause of pericardial effusion. Fracture or embolization of IVC filters is a relatively uncommon complication, but these events may have serious clinical implications. Although IVC filters are often placed with the intent of removal, the device in many patients is never removed. The long-term implications of IVC filter placement must be kept in mind when making decisions about device placement and subsequent removal.

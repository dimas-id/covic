Epithelial cells are highly polarized cells divided into an apical and a basolateral plasma membrane. The two domains are composed of a distinct set of proteins and lipids. Concerning virus infection of epithelial cells, the polarity of host cell receptor distribution defines the domain from which infection may be mediated. We were interested to analyze the infection of polarized cells by bovine coronavirus (BCV). The entry of BCV into MDCK I cells was investigated by growing the cells on a permeable support. Cell were infected with BCV from either the apical or basolateral domain. The efficiency of infection was determined by measuring the hemaglutinating activity of the virus released into the apical compartment. Virus replication was only detectable after inoculation from the apical surface. Therefore, infection of MDCK I cells with BCV is restricted to the apical side.

In this brief report we propose a new design of a medical mask with a plasma layer, which provides both additional air filtration from microdrops, bacteria and viruses due to the electrostatic effect and self-disinfecting of surfaces by a pulsed barrier discharge. The key features of the mask are the mutual arrangement of the layers, the direction of air flows and the synchronization of the discharge with respiration, which ensures the safe wearing of the mask and high degree of protection against pathogenic microorganisms.

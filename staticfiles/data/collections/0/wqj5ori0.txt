With the rapid development of the knowledge and techniques in bariatric surgery, as well as extensive expansion of indications for metabolic operations, surgeons have started to realize that the procedures they choose are not always suited to the needs and behavior of patients. Second and very frequently third revisional procedures are thus necessary in order to achieve desired outcomes and fulfill patients' expectations. Restoration of restriction is commonly the first procedure, but not all may benefit from it. We hence want to illustrate the decision-making process by presenting a patient with the background of initial Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and redo-RYGB, who then underwent a further revision by a 2-stage approach due to weight regain. The first stage involved shortening of the common channel and the second one reconstruction of his gastric pouch with duodenal switch (DS). Consequently we wish to focus here on a discussion about operative techniques and strategies to improve outcomes in such patients.

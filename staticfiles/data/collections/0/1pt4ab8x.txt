Isoxazole, constituting an important family of five-membered heterocycles with one oxygen atom and one nitrogen atom at adjacent positions is of immense importance because of its wide spectrum of biological activities and therapeutic potential. It is, therefore, of prime importance that the development of new synthetic strategies and designing of new isoxazole derivatives should be based on the most recent knowledge emerging from the latest research. This review is an endeavor to highlight the progress in the chemistry and biological activity of isoxazole derivatives which could provide a low-height flying birdâ€™s eye view of isoxazole derivatives to the medicinal chemists for the development of clinically viable drugs using this information.

Diffuse lung disease (DLD) comprises a diverse group of disorders characterized by widespread pulmonary parenchymal pathology and impaired gas exchange. While many of these disorders are categorized under the rubric of interstitial lung disease (ILD), some of these disorders involve the airspaces or peripheral airways in addition to, or rather than, the interstitium. Some of these disorders are present primarily in infancy or early childhood, while others that are prevalent in adulthood rarely occur in childhood. This chapter will review the classification of pediatric DLD and the characteristic imaging findings of specific disorders to facilitate accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment of children with these disorders.

A structure‐based in silico virtual drug discovery procedure was assessed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main protease serving as a case study. First, potential compounds were extracted from protein–ligand complexes selected from Protein Data Bank database based on structural similarity to the target protein. Later, the set of compounds was ranked by docking scores using a Electronic High‐Throughput Screening flexible docking procedure to select the most promising molecules. The set of best performing compounds was then used for similarity search over the 1 million entries in the Ligand.Info Meta‐Database. Selected molecules having close structural relationship to a 2‐methyl‐2,4‐pentanediol may provide candidate lead compounds toward the development of novel allosteric severe acute respiratory syndrome protease inhibitors.

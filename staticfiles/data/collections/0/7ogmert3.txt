Any epidemiological compartmental model with constant population is shown to be a Hamiltonian dynamical system in which the total population plays the role of the Hamiltonian function. Moreover, some particular cases within this large class of models are shown to be bi-Hamiltonian. New interacting compartmental models among different populations, which are endowed with a Hamiltonian structure, are introduced. The Poisson structures underlying the Hamiltonian description of all these dynamical systems are explicitly presented, and their associated Casimir functions are shown to provide an efficient tool in order to find exact analytical solutions for epidemiological dynamics.

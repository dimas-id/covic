OBJECTIVE The KTP laser has become commonplace in transoral head and neck surgery. The interactions of this laser with commonly used supplies in transoral surgery have not been formally examined. This study evaluates the effects of the KTP laser on surgical supplies. STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. SETTING The study was conducted in an empty operating room at a university-affiliated medical center. METHODS An Aura XP 532-nm KTP laser with a 600-nm fiber was used in pulsed and continuous modes. The beam was focused at the shaft and balloon of 3 "laser-safe" endotracheal tubes (ETTs), a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETT, and a Codman surgical patty. Time to penetrate was recorded. Results The KTP laser beam was unable to penetrate any of the laser-resistant ETTs. It did react with the black number markings on the PVC ETT by producing sparks but was unable to penetrate the shaft of the ETT. The KTP laser was nonreactive with all ETT cuffs except in 1 of 3 trials with the outer balloon cuff of a Rusch Lasertubus ETT when the laser was used in a continuous mode. The KTP laser caused the production of a flame upon contact with the blue radiopaque strip of the surgical patty, even when the patty was wet. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that a number of safe ETT options may be used during transoral laser microsurgery with a KTP laser. In addition, Codman surgical patties are shown to be a significant fire risk in KTP laser surgery.

INTRODUCTION A growing body of research has addressed adolescent use of mobile devices to exchange sexually explicit images and messages (sexting). Although there are legal consequences in some states for sexting among adolescents, research findings have also demonstrated associations between sexting and sexual activity. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize research examining the association between adolescent sexting and sexual activity. METHODS Five databases (CINAHL, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were searched for studies measuring adolescent sexting and sexual behaviors. Studies were appraised for quality using a modified Downs and Black scale. Studies reporting frequencies or odds ratios were eligible for inclusion in random effects meta-analytic models. RESULTS Of 669 articles retrieved, 9 studies met inclusion criteria for systematic review; of these, 6 were included in meta-analysis. After pooling data from 9676 adolescents, the odds of reporting sexual activity were found to be 6.3 times higher (95% CI, 4.9-8.1; Q = 14.3; I2 = 65.1) for adolescents who sent sexts compared with those who did not. DISCUSSION These data suggest that adolescents who send sexually explicit text messages are more likely to report sexual activity than adolescents who do not. Midwives are well poised to integrate a discussion of sexting into sexual and reproductive health counseling with adolescent and young adult patients.

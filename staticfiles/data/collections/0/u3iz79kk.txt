We thank dr. Ludvigsson (1) on his effort to improve knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. In trying to understand the spread of the disease, one of the most notable features is that only a small number of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections have involved children. The huge age disparity in disease severity might be one of the most stringent fundamental knowledge gaps.

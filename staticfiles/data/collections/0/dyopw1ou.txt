BACKGROUND During early treatment of haemorrhagic shock maintenance of cerebral and end-organ oxygen supply by fluid resuscitation is mandatory. Gelatin-polysuccinat (GP) recently regained attention despite a still unclear risk profile and widely unknown effects on cerebral and peripheral microcirculation. This study investigates the effects of GP versus balanced electrolyte solution (BEL) with focus on cerebral regional oxygen saturation and peripheral microcirculation in a porcine haemorrhagic shock model. METHODS After Animal Care Committee approval haemorrhagic shock was induced by arterial blood withdrawal in 27 anaesthetized pigs. Consequently, the animals received rapid fluid resuscitation by either GP or BEL to replace the removed amount of blood, or remained untreated (n = 3 Ã— 9). Over two hours cerebral regional oxygen saturation by near-infrared spectroscopy and peripheral buccal microcirculation by combined white-light spectrometry and laser-Doppler flowmetry were recorded. Secondary parameters included extended haemodynamics, spirometry, haematological and blood gas parameters. RESULTS Both fluid resuscitation regimes sufficiently stabilized the macro- and microcirculation in haemorrhagic shock with a more pronounced effect following GP infusion. GP administration led to a persisting, critical impairment of cerebral regional oxygen saturation through considerable haemodilution. Survival rates were 100% in both fluid resuscitation groups, but only 33% in the untreated control. CONCLUSION Equal amounts of GP and BEL sufficiently stabilize systemic circulation and microcirculatory perfusion. Forced fluid resuscitation by GP should be applied with caution to prevent haemodilution-induced impairment of cerebral oxygen delivery.

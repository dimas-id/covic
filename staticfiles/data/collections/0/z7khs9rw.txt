Despite respiratory symptoms are typically found during the course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), gastrointestinal manifestations are increasingly described. However, data regarding COVID‐19‐associated pancreatic injury are still limited, as well as the mechanisms underlying COVID‐19 induced‐pancreatic damage have not been completely clarified. Herein, we described pancreatic abnormalities in six (8.5%) out of 70 patients with COVID‐19 hospitalized in our unit from February 25, 2020 to May 10, 2020. We hypothesized that pancreatic damage may be associated with several factors including direct effect of SARS‐CoV‐2, inflammatory cascade, dehydration and multiple organ dysfunction.

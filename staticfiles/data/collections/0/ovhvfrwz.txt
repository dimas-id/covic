Network Slicing (NS) is an evolving area of research, performing a logical arrangement of resources to operate as individual networks, hence allowing for massively customizable service and tenant requirements. NS, via the respective network architecture can enable an effective deployment of 5G networks and support a great variety of emerging use cases and/or related services. In this scope and with the aim of extending all potential network and service benefits, the concept of dynamic NS becomes a prominent feature of 5G allowing for connectivity and data processing tailored to specific customersâ€™ requirements. We discuss several essential features and fundamental designing principles that can affect the realization of a reliable dynamic NS, capable of serving an immense multiplicity of 5G-based innovations, towards structuring a fully mobile and inclusive society. Furthermore, due to its context, dynamic NS can support digital transformation and mobilization of industry vertical customers, implicating for significant commercial potential. To this aim, we also discuss related perspectives for market growth coming from proposed business models, together with regulatory concerns that could affect future growth of dynamic NS.

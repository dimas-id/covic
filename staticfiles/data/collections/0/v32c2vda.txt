This article describes infectious diseases that are of special importance to intensivists. The emphasis on epidemiology notwithstanding, it also addresses clinical, diagnostic, and treatment issues related to each infection described. The discussion avoids terrorism-related aspects of these infections, because they were very well covered in the October 2005 issue of the Critical Care Clinics.

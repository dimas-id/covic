Acquired myasthenia gravis was diagnosed in a four‐year‐old castrated male Somali in which the presenting signs consisted of progressive lameness, weakness, generalised muscle tremors, an inability to blink and voice loss. Clinical testing with edrophonium chloride, electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry and serum immunological techniques confirmed the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and proved its immune‐mediated nature. Clinical remission was achieved following long term immunosuppression with corticosteroids.

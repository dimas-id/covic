BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Acute basilar occlusions have a poor prognosis without recanalization. Many have underlying severe atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis coexisting with acute thrombosis, requiring treatment of both pathologies in the same session, though technical risks may be encountered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of combined treatment by using stent retrievers for the thrombosis, together with angioplasty and stent placement for the underlying stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective review of 13 patients with basilar occlusions treated with thrombectomy by the Solitaire stent retriever and angioplasty and intracranial stent placement for underlying severe vertebrobasilar stenosis in the same session. Reperfusion was assessed in terms of the TICI score. Perioperative complications were recorded. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the NIHSS at discharge and the mRS on follow-up at 90 days. RESULTS Of the 30 patients with acute basilar artery occlusions treated with stent retrievers during the study period, 18 had coexisting severe intracranial stenosis. Thirteen patients meeting the criteria for our study received combined mechanical thrombectomy and angioplasty with stent placement. The successful recanalization rate was 100%. Distal vessel embolizations occurred in 3 patients. There were 2 mortalities. On discharge, 10 patients (77%) had an improvement in NIHSS of ≥10 points. At 90 days, 6 patients (46%) had a good functional outcome with an mRS of ≤2. CONCLUSIONS The combined use of mechanical thrombectomy with angioplasty and stent placement for acute basilar occlusions with underlying severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is technically feasible and safe.

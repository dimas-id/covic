BACKGROUND Laparoscopic splenectomy has been performed in a standard fashion with 4 to 5 trocars since the early 1990s. Single access laparoscopy has recently gained interest, but single access laparoscopic splenectomy has not been reported to date. It has the possible benefits of less pain, faster recovery, better cosmesis, with theoretically similar costs to that of traditional trocars. METHODS A case is presented and the surgical technique of single access laparoscopic splenectomy is detailed. RESULTS The patient is an otherwise healthy 24-year-old male with medically refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and a platelet count of 15 000. A splenectomy was performed using a single incision laparoscopic technique. The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position, and a 2.5-cm left upper quadrant incision was made. A multi-instrument flexible single incision port was used that held 3 trocars. A standard splenectomy was performed through this port. A linear stapler was used to transect the splenic hilum. The procedure time was just over 2 hours. The patient did well, was happy with his incision, and was discharged with a platelet count of 108 000. CONCLUSIONS Single access laparoscopic splenectomy is feasible in select patients and may provide a less painful, better cosmetic result.

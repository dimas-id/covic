Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the development of some of vaccines and their use in controlling such major diseases as diphtheria, rinderpest, Newcastle disease, smallpox, pertussis, yellow fever, rabies, etc. Park–Williams Number 8 (PW8) strain is used to make diphtherial toxoid for vaccines. As a source of toxin, it is rendered nontoxic by incubation with formalin under alkaline conditions. The product's retention of antigenicity, enabling it to induce antitoxin antibodies, makes it an excellent pediatric vaccine. Vaccine against Rinderpest Virus was developed by Koch in 1897 by administering bile from infected cattle. Animals that survived were permanently immune. Formalin- and chloroform-inactivated vaccines were developed using tissues from the infected animals. For the control of Newcastle disease, a number of attenuated live-virus vaccines have been developed which are widely used to control the disease. The Bl strain, the LaSota strain, and the F strain are used to immunize birds of all ages by different routes, including by addition to drinking water and by spraying. Protection against rabies correlates with SN antibody, which can be assessed by a number of tests. Pasteur's classical vaccine, developed from infected spinal cord tissue dried at room temperature for 3–14 days, was given in a series of 21–28 inoculations beginning with material dried the longest and progressing through material dried for only 3 days.

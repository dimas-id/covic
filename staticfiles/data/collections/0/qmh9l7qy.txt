Abstract Importation and transmission of measles via air travel is a public health concern to countries, which are close to or have achieved elimination, i.e., to the majority of countries in Europe. In 2018, two measles cases occurred in Berlin residents, who flew within Europe while being infectious. In addition to contact tracing through passenger manifests, we contacted national authorities in flight destination countries or embarking countries and inquired about epidemiologically linked measles cases to the two Berlin index cases. We identified eight epidemiologically linked cases (six males, median age: 32 years) from three countries associated with three air-travels. Consequently measles was imported to Germany (Bavaria), Denmark and possibly Sweden. Our investigations revealed impediments to an effective public health response indicating the need to revisit current guidelines and methods to better control transmission of measles related to air travel.

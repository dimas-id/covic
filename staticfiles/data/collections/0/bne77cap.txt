Abstract A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was developed to differentiate the bovine diarrhea virus (BVDV) from other pestiviruses, and to determine the genotype of the BVDV isolates. For this purpose, primer pairs were selected in the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). The primers BE and B2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus-specific. Two primer pairs named B3B4 and B5B6 were specific of BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with either the B3B4 or the B5B6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV isolates tested but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in the genotype II, sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their classification into this genotype.

Minimally invasive techniques (MIS) have been evolving quickly in colorectal surgery during the last two decades. Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was developed as a combination of skills acquired from different MIS approaches such as Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM), Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) and Natural Orifices Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES). TaTME allows for a better visualization of surgical planes of dissection and achievement of rectal resection following oncologic principles. We here present the standardized taTME technique in use at the Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona and our published outcomes in rectal cancer.

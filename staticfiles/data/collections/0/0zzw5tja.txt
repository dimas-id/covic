PURPOSE OF REVIEW Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) are two types of upper gastrointestinal bleeding that may present similarly, but are managed very differently. This article reviews the pathogenesis and guidelines in management of both of these conditions with emphasis on recent advances in the field. RECENT FINDINGS Off-label use of Hemospray has been shown in several case series to be useful in managing acute bleeding from PHG. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration presents an alternative approach for this condition. Radiofrequency ablation may be an alternative therapy to argon plasma coagulation in the endoscopic treatment of GAVE, as it consists of fewer sessions and has been shown to decrease gastrointestinal blood loss. SUMMARY The treatment options for PHG and GAVE are constantly evolving and expanding. In this review, we present the latest approaches in the gastroenterologist's arsenal to deal with these conditions.

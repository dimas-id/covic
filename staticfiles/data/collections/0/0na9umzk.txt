This report describes the clinical and virological characteristics of three children in a family cluster experiencing infection with SARS-CoV2. While the youngest child was not infected, both parents and the two 2- and 5 years-old children became infected. The children were only briefly symptomatic with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms. They initially shed infectious virus from the upper respiratory tract, but cleared the virus after five to six days in the nasopharynx. However, SARS-CoV2 RNA was continuously detected in the stools of the children for more than 4 weeks indicating a predominant replication within the gastrointestinal tract.

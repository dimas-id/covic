This chapter focuses on the recent information of the glycoprotein components of enveloped viruses and points out specific findings on viral envelopes. Although enveloped viruses of different major groups vary in size and shape, as well as in the molecular weight of their structural polypeptides, there are general similarities in the types of polypeptide components present in virions. The types of structural components found in viral membranes are summarized briefly in the chapter. All the enveloped viruses studied to date possess one or more glycoprotein species and lipid as a major structural component. The presence of carbohydrate covalently linked to proteins is demonstrated by the incorporation of a radioactive precursor, such as glucosamine or fucose, into viral polypeptides, which is resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enveloped viruses share many common features in the organization of their structural components, as indicated by several approaches, including electron microscopy, surface-labeling, and proteolytic digestion experiments, and the isolation of subviral components. The chapter summarizes the detailed structure of the glycoproteins of four virus groups: (1) influenza virus glycoproteins, (2) rhabdovirus G protein, (3) togavirus glycoprotein, and (4) paramyxovirus glycoproteins The information obtained includes the size and shape of viral glycoproteins, the number of polypeptide chains in the complete glycoprotein structure, and compositional data on the polypeptide and oligosaccharide portions of the molecules.

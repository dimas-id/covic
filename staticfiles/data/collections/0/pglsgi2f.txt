Telemedicine is about more than simply using audio-visual technology to care for patients, but rather an opportunity to fundamentally improve patient access, quality, efficiencies, and experience. Regarding sleep medicine, it has the potential to drive sleep medicineâ€™s evolution. By enabling care across geographies and facilitating population-based management, sleep medicine is poised to take advantage of telemedicine capabilities. In this introductory chapter, we highlight issues related to sleep telemedicine, while providing a framework in which to approach this transformational journey thoughtfully. We thereby set the stage for the individual chapters in this edition of Sleep Medicine Clinics.

Summary High-flow nasal therapy is increasingly used in hospitals because of its effectiveness and patient comfort. However, pathogens in the patient's nasal and oral cavities may be dispersed by forced air. This study aimed to investigate the risk of pathogen dispersal during high-flow nasal therapy. Liquid and bacterial dispersal were assessed via in-vitro experimental set-ups using a manikin. Thickened water or fresh yeast solution mimicked saliva and nasal mucus secretions. Dispersal was limited to the proximal area of the face and nasal cannula, suggesting that high-flow nasal therapy does not increase the risk of droplet and contact infection.

Ever since the advent of Rituximab and subsequently the emergence of other compounds targeting B cells, a cornucopia of medical applications have been found for this family of compounds. After their establishment as standard of care in many conditions such as rituximab in lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis, they have been progressively found to aid in the treatment of many other conditions. This area constituted a fertile area of research in the past 12 years. Physicians have investigated the B-cell depleting agents use in cases of autoimmune hematologic cytopenias such as immune thrombocytopenia, Evans syndrome, cold and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and other thrombophilic disorders such as the antiphospholipid syndrome and thrombocytopenic purpura. This chapter presents a historical perspective reviewing the various studies that have been published in this field. In addition, it offers a current assessment of the evidence regarding the use of B-cell depleting agents in the aforementioned conditions.

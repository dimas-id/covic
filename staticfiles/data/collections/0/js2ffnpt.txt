4044 stool samples of dogs with diarrhoea were examined by electron microscopy. The samples were sent for routine diagnostics in the years 1988-1993. Over the examination period virus was detected in 32% of the samples. Parvovirus was diagnosed in 17.2% and coronavirus in 12.4% of the cases. The number of parvovirus-positive samples was lower than in former years, whereas the number of coronavirus-positive samples was higher. Other virus particles (paramyxo-, picorna-, calici- and astrovirus or morphologically similar particles as well as rota- and adenovirus) were altogether detected in 2.5% of the samples. This detection rate corresponded to the results of former years. The majority of parvovirus-positive samples (80.7%) was found in animals aged between six weeks and six months. Of the coronavirus-positive samples 56.5% were detected in dogs older than six months of age and 42.5% in animals between six weeks and six months. In puppies up to six weeks viruses were only detected infrequently (parvovirus 4.7%, coronavirus 0.9%).

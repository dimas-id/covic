Amino acid sequence of the human respiratory syncytial (RS) virus nucleocapsid (NC) protein, deduced from the DNA sequence of a recombinant plasmid, is presented. The cDNA plasmid (pRSB11) has 1412 bp of RS viral NC sequence and lacks six nucleotides of the 5' end of mRNA. There is a single long open reading frame encoding 467 amino acids. This 51540 dal protein is rich in basic amino acids and has no homologies with other known viral capsid proteins.

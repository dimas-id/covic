BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019, is the cause of ongoing pandemic. We analyzed the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, a classification of the Chinese medicine dialectic and treatment regimen, and promptly enacted the recommendation of Korean medicine preparations in herbal medicine covered under domestic medical insurance benefits depending on the circumstances in our country. METHOD: The clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was developed based on consensus from a group of experts. RESULTS: Two kinds of herbal medicines (HM) were recommended for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgitang, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Saengmaek-san. Two herbal preparations were recommended for people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bojungikgi-tang. Three herbal preparations were recommended for mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Galgunhaegui-tang was recommended for those without pneumonia with wind-warmth disease invading the lungs; Sosiho-tang plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san was recommended for those with dampness-heat disease in the lungs. For the recovery stage, Samchulkunbi-tang plus Saengmaek-san, or Samchulkunbi-tang plus Chungseuiki-tang was recommended. CONCLUSION: The CPG was developed to guide the use of Korean herbal medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, and it is expected that this will be the basis for providing proper treatment of similar infectious diseases in the future.

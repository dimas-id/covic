The biological behavior of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) makes resection of the tumor with adequate margins, a mode of curative treatment. GIST does not have lymphatic permeation. Hence, the goal of therapy is complete resection of visible and microscopic disease, which can be achieved by adequate tumor-free margins. Laparoscopic management of large GIST tumors is discouraged because of the fear of spillage of the tumor or rupture of the tumor capsule while handling a large tumor and thus causing metastasis.

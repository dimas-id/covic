In this article a transparency of the analyst is seen as a key aspect with respect to the development of the psychoanalytic psychotherapeutic process. Psychoanalysts and psychotherapists with a transparent approach enable their analysands/patients to participate in the course of the analytic work. Transparency and participation jointly facilitate the shared reflection on internal and interactive processes. These processes may take the form of introjective identification. Transparency and participation create an atmosphere in which the dyad has a better grasp of unconscious aspects in the introjective identification. After clarification of the terms transparency and participation and the theoretical background, a case report is presented showcasing crucial interactions in which the mechanism of introjective identification and the internal dramaturgy of both participants is demonstrated. The case report is connected to the theoretical part in the concluding remarks. In the analytic situation the process of introjective identification bridges the gap between the analysand’s and the analyst’s unconscious themes: as a result the psychoanalyst can discover unconscious affects reaching the inner world originally stemming from the unconscious of the analysand/patient. A fertile interplay emerges within the analyst, which can be communicated to the analysand and is then present in the dyadic analytic experience. Transparency and participation are valuable technical means to discover and understand the unconscious part of introjective identification in all its ramifications.

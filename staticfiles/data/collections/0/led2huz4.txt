The success of any gene transfer procedure, either through in vivo inoculation of the genetic material or after gene transfer into the patientâ€™s cells ex vivo, strictly depends upon the efficiency of nucleic acid internalization by the target cells. As a matter of fact, making gene transfer more efficient continues to represent the most relevant challenge to the clinical success of gene therapy.

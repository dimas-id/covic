Abstract The genus Dianthovirus is one of eight genera in the family Tombusviridae. All the genera have monopartite positive-stranded RNA genomes, except the dianthoviruses which have bipartite genomes. The dianthoviruses are distributed worldwide. Although they share common structural features with the other Tombusviridae viruses in their virions and the terminal structure of the genomic RNAs, the bipartite nature of the dianthovirus genome offers an ideal experimental system with which to study basic issues of virology. The two genomic RNAs seem to use distinct strategies to regulate their translation, transcription, genome replication, genome packaging, and cell-to-cell movement during infection. This review summarizes the current state of our knowledge of the dianthoviruses, with its main emphasis on the molecular biology of the virus, including the viral and host factors required for its infection of host plants. The epidemiology of the virus and the possible viral impacts on agriculture and the environment are also discussed.

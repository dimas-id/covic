Abstract In this paper, an improved recovery method for target ssDNA using amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles (ASMNPs) is reported. This method takes advantages of the amino-modified silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles prepared using water-in-oil microemulsion technique, which employs amino-modified silica as the shell and iron oxide as the core of the magnetic nanoparticles. The nanoparticles have a silica surface with amino groups and can be conjugated with any desired bio-molecules through many existing amino group chemistry. In this research, a linear DNA probe was immobilized onto nanoparticles through streptavidin conjugation using covalent bonds. A target ssDNA(I) (5′-TMR-CGCATAGGGCCTCGTGATAC-3′) has been successfully recovered from a crude sample under a magnet field through their special recognition and hybridization. A designed ssDNA fragment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus at a much lower concentration than the target ssDNA(I) was also recovered with high efficiency and good selectivity.

To address the need for refined information in COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a deep learning-based system that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) question answering (QA) techniques combined with summarization for mining the available scientific literature. Our system leverages the Information Retrieval (IR) system and QA models to extract relevant snippets from the existing literature given a query. Fluent summaries are also provided to help understand the content in a more efficient way. In this paper, we describe our CAiRE-COVID system architecture and methodology for building the system. To bootstrap the further study, the code for our system is available at https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/CAiRE-COVID

DNA tumor viruses induce tumors in animals and humans by transforming the infected host cells. These oncogenic viruses encode viral proteins, which deregulate the integrated framework of host cellular processes, while preventing cell death. Studies revealed newer insights as to how specific tumor targets could be modulated for tumor therapy.

The early cases of HIV/AIDS in China were mostly foreign nationals. The Chinese government's response then was to stop and prevent HIV from entering China. However, the policy was not effective. From the middle 1990s, HIV/ AIDS spread all over China and all modes of transmission have been reported. By the end of 2003, China estimated that there were 840,000 cases of HIV/AIDS. China's HIV/AIDS policy has been changing along with its epidemic change. Based on an extensive document and literature review, I depict China's HIV/AIDS epidemic and policy and illustrate the main factors contributing to its policy evolution.

The recently discovered IFN‐λ4 has been found to have antiviral activity against several viruses. However, it's unknown whether IFN‐λ4 can inhibit HIV infection. Here, we show that IFN‐λ4 could suppress HIV infection of macrophages. This IFN‐λ4‐mediated HIV inhibition was compromised by the antibodies against IFN‐λ receptor complex, IFN‐λR1/IL‐10R2. IFN‐λ4 enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT1, and induced antiviral interferon‐stimulated genes. These findings indicated that IFN‐λ4 can inhibit HIV via JAK/STAT signalling pathway.

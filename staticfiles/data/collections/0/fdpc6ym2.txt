Although immunosuppressed patients may be more prone to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with atypical presentation, long‐term immunosuppression therapy may provide some sort of protection for severe clinical complications of COVID‐19. The interaction between immunosuppression and new antiviral drugs in the treatment of transplanted patients contracting COVID‐19 has not yet been fully investigated. Moreover, data regarding the optimal management of these patients are still very limited. We report a case of the successful recovery from severe COVID‐19 of a kidney‐transplanted patient treated with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, steroid, and tocilizumab.

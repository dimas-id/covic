EARLIER THIS year, scientists claimed a partial victory in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To date, there have been more than 8,000 cases of SARS worldwide and more than 750 deaths. So when Dutch scientists working for the World Health Organization announced that they had identified the virus that causes SARS, there was general rejoicing. David Heymann, the WHO executive director responsible for communicable diseases, said he was '99 per cent sure' that SARS was caused by a mutant form of coronavirus, the virus that causes the common cold.

During the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the benefit of treating patients with cancer must be weighed against the COVID-19 infection risks to patients, staff and society. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and raises particular interest during the pandemic as recent reports show that the TMPRSS2 (and other serine proteases), which facilitate the entry, replication and budding of the virion from a cell, can be inhibited using androgen deprivation therapy. Nevertheless, patients with metastatic prostate cancer commonly receive chemotherapy which may compromise their immune system. This paper aims to address the current status of the COVID-19 in patients with cancer overall and suggests an optimal approach to patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

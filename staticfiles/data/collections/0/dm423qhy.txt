The devastating effects of the coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐Cov‐2) has led to urgent attempts to find effective therapeutic agents for inpatient and outpatient treatment of COVID‐19. Initial enthusiasm for the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has abated. However, as a result of positive clinical experience with azithromycin used alone during the first few days of the flu‐like illness caused by this coronavirus, we recommend formal clinical trials using azithromycin early in the course of a COVID‐19 infection. There is one clinical trial initiated, the individually‐randomized, telemedicine‐based, “Azithromycin for COVID‐19 Treatment in Outpatients Nationwide (ACTION)” based at the University of California San Francisco. This placebo‐controlled trial is designed to determine the efficacy of a single 1.2 g dose of oral azithromycin to prevent COVID‐19 patient progression to hospitalization. We recommend formal clinical trials of azithromycin in its prepackaged form at the first sign of COVID‐19 infection in adults and children, using an initial adult dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg per day for four days, a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g, and for children 5 to 18 years of age, 10 mg/kg on the first day followed by 5 mg/kg for four days.

The coronavirus (CV) infection has been reproduced on monkeys (Macaca mulatta) for the first time. The strain CVRM 281, obtained from rhesus monkey who died of the spontaneous CV injection, has been used for the infection. The experimental CV infection has a chronic current with periodical relapses and virus persistence. Gastrointestinal tract (enterocolitis) and respiratory tract (pneumonia) are damaged exhibiting characteristic histological lesions. The monkey model of the CV injection can be used to solve obscure questions of human one.

West Nile virus (WNV) is an important cause of viral encephalitis in birds and animals, including humans. Amino acid 159 of the envelope (E) protein is reportedly implicated in the different levels of neurovirulence in mice infected with WNV NY99 or Eg101. We investigated the role of amino acid 159 of the E protein in the pathogenesis of WNV infection. We produced recombinant WNV with the structural proteins of the NY99 or Eg101 strain (NY-WT or EgCME-WT) and mutant viruses with substitutions of amino acid 159 of the E protein (NY-E-V159I or EgCME-E-I159V). The NY-WT and NY-E-V159I or EgCME-WT and EgCME-E-I159V titers in culture supernatant were similar. The mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intraperitoneally with NY-WT or NY-E-V159I were also similar. In contrast, the mortality rate and viral titer in the brains of mice inoculated intracranially with EgCME-E-I159V were significantly higher than those of mice inoculated with EgCME-WT. The numbers of CD3-positive and CD8-positive T cells were greater in brains inoculated with EgCME-E-I159V than in those inoculated with EgCME-WT. Therefore, amino acid 159 of the E protein modulates the pathogenicity of WNV by affecting viral replication and T-cell infiltration in the brain.

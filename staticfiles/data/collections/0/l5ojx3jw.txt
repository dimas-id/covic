Since the first appearance of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) in China on December 2019, the world has now witnessed the emergence of the SARS- CoV-2 outbreak. Therefore, due to the high transmissibility rate of virus, there is an urgent need to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to prevent more cases affected by the virus. In this study, a computational approach is proposed for vaccine design against the envelope (E) protein of SARS-CoV-2, which contains a conserved sequence feature. First, we sought to gain potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes for vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2. Second, we attempted to develop a multi-epitope vaccine. Immune targeting of such epitopes could theoretically provide defense against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we evaluated the affinity of the vaccine to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to stimulate the immune system response to this vaccine. We also identified a collection of B-cell and T-cell epitopes derived from E proteins that correspond identically to SARS-CoV-2 E proteins. The in-silico design of our potential vaccine against E protein of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a high affinity to MHC molecules, and it can be a candidate to make a protection against this pandemic event.

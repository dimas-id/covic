Background The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. As the numbers expand exponentially, a paucity of data regarding health care workers (HCWs), who are at the forefront of this disaster, exists. Hence we decided to conduct a study amongst the HCWs to determine the prevalence and risk factor stratification. Methods This was an online questionnaire-based survey of healthcare workers conducted at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, India from 23rd March to 30th April 2020. Data on flu-like symptoms, travel history, posting in high-risk or low risk zones, and prophylactic drugs was collected. Results Out of the 18000 HCWs who were approached 4403 responded and adequate data of 3667 was available for analysis. 14.7% had flu-like symptoms. 1.8% (20/1113) of the participants tested were positive for the virus. HCWs posted in the high-risk zones had more symptoms than those working in low-risk zones (169/539, 31.4% vs 679/3128, 21.7%), p<0.001; but no difference in COVID-19 positivity rates (p=0.849). Symptomatic HCWs had higher positivity (10/193, 5.2%) than the asymptomatic ones (10/920, 1.1%), p=0.001. HCQ was taken by 755/1113 (67.8%) people and 14 (1.9%) of these reported positive for the virus. Conclusion This is the first study on healthcare workers from India to the best of our knowledge. Our findings suggest that posting in a high-risk zone with adequate PPE does not pose higher risk to the HCWs. Moreover, HCQ as a prophylactic has no use. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04339608.

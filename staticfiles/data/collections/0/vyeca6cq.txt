Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia can develop heart problems and may also may be susceptible to proarrhythmia, virus-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbance and adverse effects from the use of antiviral drugs. We report a transient Brugada-like ECG pattern without ongoing fever in a 57-year-old man, admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, who did not have syncope or a family history of sudden cardiac death. LEARNING POINTS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia can develop heart problems. A transient Brugada-like ECG pattern was observed in a non-febrile COVID-19 patient. SARS-CoV-2 may have a direct effect on myocardial ion channels.

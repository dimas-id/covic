The relationship between pandemic and human mobility has received considerable attention from scholars, as investigating such relationship can provide an indication of how human mobility changes in response to a public health crisis or whether reduced mobility contributes to preventing the spread of an infectious disease. While several studies attempted to unveil this relationship, no studies have focused on changes in mobility pattern at a finer scale utilizing high-resolution datasets. To address the complex association between pandemic's spread and human mobility, this paper presents two categories of mobility datasets-trip mode and trip purpose-that concern nearly 10 million citizens' movements during the first 100 days of COVID-19 in Seoul, South Korea, where no major lockdown has been imposed. We curate hourly data of subway ridership, traffic volume and population present count at selected points of interests. The results to be derived from the presented datasets can be used as an important reference for public health decision making in the post COVID-19 era.

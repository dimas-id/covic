This is a review of diagnostic imaging findings in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CT findings are frequently bilateral, multilobar and peripheral ground-glass opacities with vascular enlargements. Consolidations often appear during progression as well as crazy paving and reticulation. Lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions and pneumothorax are rare and should raise concern for other disease. Initially the CT can be normal, and the diagnostic performance for COVID-19 is not optimal. However, findings of characteristic ground-glass opacities during the ongoing epidemic should lead to considerations, that the patient may have COVID-19.

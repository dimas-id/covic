Abstract CD13/aminopeptidase N is a membrane-bound metalloproteinase implicated in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and pathogenesis. Anti-CD13 antibodies can neutralize HCMV infectivity, and HCMV viremia after bone marrow transplantation induces anti-CD13 autoantibodies which correlate with development of chronic graft vs. host disease. We examined whether murine CD13/APN was similarly implicated in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) disease. MCMV infection did induce anti-CD13 antibodies in mice in a strain-specific manner. ICR and 129S mice developed high titers of anti-CD13 antibodies and anti-MCMV antibodies after MCMV infection, whereas CBA and CBAxC57BL/6 f1 hybrid mice produced antibodies against MCMV only. Unlike HCMV, no evidence was found for a correlation between host cell CD13/APN expression and infection, or for the presence of CD13/APN on MCMV particles, although APN inhibitors decreased MCMV plaque formation. Reproduction of CD13/APN autoantibody production in the murine system should make it possible to determine if these antibodies contribute to CMV pathogenesis.

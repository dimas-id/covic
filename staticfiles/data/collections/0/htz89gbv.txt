The neocortex is an ultracomplex, six-layered structure that develops from the dorsal palliai sector of the telencephalic hemispheres (Figs. 2.24, 2.25, 11.1). All mammals, including monotremes and marsupials, possess a neocortex, but in reptiles, i.e. the ancestors of mammals, only a three-layered neocortical primordium is present [509, 511]. The term neocortex refers to its late phylogenetic appearance, in comparison to the “palaeocortical” olfactory cortex and the “archicortical” hippocampal cortex, both of which are present in all amniotes [509].

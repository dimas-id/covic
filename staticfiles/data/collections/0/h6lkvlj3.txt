Abstract SARS-Co-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide since December 2019. A relevant rate of patients develops an acute respiratory distress syndrome that require hospitalization. Among them, a non-negligible rate (9.8%-15.2%) requires tracheal intubation for invasive ventilation. We report the case of a COVID-19 patient developing pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema secondary to post-intubation tracheal injury. The management of COVID-19 patient can be challenging due to the risk of disease transmission to caregivers and epidemic spread. We performed a bedside tracheal injury surgical repair, after failure of conservative management, with resolution of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema and improvement of patientâ€™s conditions.

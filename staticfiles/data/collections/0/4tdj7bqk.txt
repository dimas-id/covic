The fungal pathogen Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes oral and vaginal mucosal infections as well as systemic disease. The ability of C. albicans to adhere to host surfaces is positively correlated with its pathogenicity. We prepared a polyclonal anti-Candida albicans antibody in chicken egg yolk (anti-C. albicans IgY) and investigated its in vitro effectiveness in preventing C. albicans adherence and biofilm formation. Anti-C. albicans IgY significantly reduced the adherence of C. albicans SC5314 to human oral epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. The same effect was also observed in other Candida spp. including C. albicans serotype A and B. Further, the IgY inhibited biofilm formation of C. albicans in medium without serum, but the inhibition was slightly restored in medium conditioned with 10% serum. The data indicate that anti-C. albicans IgY cross-reacted with various Candida spp. and may have a protective effect against oral candidiasis and reduce the dissemination of Candida spp. This effect may be due to the blocking of the binding of Candida spp. to the host cells. However, the blocking did not play a role when Candida formed a germ tube in the presence of serum. Therefore, anti-C. albicans IgY may be considered as a prophylactic immunotherapy or possibly an adjunctive antifungal therapy under limited conditions.

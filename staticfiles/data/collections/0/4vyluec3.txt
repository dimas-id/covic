OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the impact of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fellowship training on the fellows' clinical practice as well as former fellows' perception of their fellowship experience. METHODS A survey composed of 50 multiple-choice questions was e-mailed to 268 former MIS fellows who began a fellowship in the United States between 2000 and 2005. E-mail addresses were obtained from Covidien, an industry sponsor of MIS fellowships. RESULTS The response rate was 30%. The most frequent reason for choosing an MIS fellowship was to enhance laparoscopic skills (34%). A total of 85% believed that an MIS fellowship provided an edge on referral of advanced laparoscopic procedures. In all, 75% indicated that their fellowship was extremely beneficial, and 86% would recommend their former fellowship to future applicants. CONCLUSION The majority of respondents felt that their MIS fellowship experience was beneficial and had a positive impact on their laparoscopic knowledge base, skills, referrals, and career.

Morphogenesis of a modified Bucyrus strain of equine arteritis virus (EAV) in BHK-21 cells was studied. Bacillary tubules were first detected in the cytoplasm 8 h after infection, and mature virions 79 to 122 nm in diameter, 101 nm on average, were mostly observed in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) at 12 h or later. They had isometrical cores and morphological subunits in the outer layer. Budding occurred from the RER and the outer nuclear membrane, but not from the cell surface. Structural linkage was detected between the tubule and the virus core. Aberrant strands were occasionally demonstrated within the nucleus 12 h after infection, and immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling revealed viral antigen also in the nucleus.

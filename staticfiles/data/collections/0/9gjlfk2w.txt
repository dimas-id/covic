Since February 2013, human infections with the novel influenza A H7N9 virus have occurred in eastern China. It is important to detect mutations in viral genes and analyze the clinical features of patients and viral shedding duration related to neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance. We collected clinical specimens from 31 hospitalized H7N9 patients and sequenced NA, PB2, HA, and M gene fragments. Of the 31 identified patients, 7 (22.6%) carried the R292K substitution in NA, 30 (96.8%), 3 (9.7%), and 5 (16.1%) carried E627K, Q591K, and D701N mutations in PB2, respectively, and 2 (6.5%) carried both E627K and D701N mutations in PB2. All 26 identified patients harbored Q226L mutations and possessed only a single arginine (R) at cleavage sites in the HA and a S31N mutation in M2. Among 7 NA-R292K mutated patients, 3 died and 4 were discharged. There was no significant difference in the days that patients started oseltamivir treatment after symptom onset between NA-R292K mutant and NA-R292 wild-type patients (median days, 7 vs 6, P = 0.374). NA-R292K mutant patients had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding than NA-R292 wild-type patients after oseltamivir treatment (median days, 10 vs 5, P = 0.022). The mutation of R292K in NA conferring the potential ability of oseltamivir resistance resulted in prolonged viral duration and poor outcome and should be taken into consideration in the clinical management of infected patients.

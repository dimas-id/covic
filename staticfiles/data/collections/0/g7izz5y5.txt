Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a clinically important neurotropic virus that can cause acute flaccid paralysis and encephalitis, leading to cardiopulmonary failure and death. Recurring outbreaks of EV71 have been reported in several countries. The current lack of approved anti-EV71 therapy has prompted intense research into antiviral development. Several strategies – ranging from target-based chemical design to compound library screenings – have been employed, while others revisited compound series generated from antiviral developments against poliovirus and human rhinoviruses. These efforts have given rise to a diversity of antiviral candidates that include small molecules and non-conventional nucleic-acid-based strategies. This review aims to highlight candidates with potential for further clinical development based on their putative modes of action.

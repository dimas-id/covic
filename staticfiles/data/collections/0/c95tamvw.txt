PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Evidence is rapidly accumulating implicating gut dysbiosis in hypertension (HTN). However, we are far from understanding whether this is a cause or consequence of HTN, and how to best translate this fundamental knowledge to advance the management of HTN. This review aims to summarize recent advances in the field, illustrate the connections between the gut and hypertension, and establish that the gut microbiota (GM)-gut interaction is centrally positioned for consideration as an innovative approach for HTN therapeutics. RECENT FINDINGS: Animal models of HTN have shown that gut pathology occurs in HTN, and provides some clues to mechanisms linking the dysbiosis, gut pathology, and HTN. SUMMARY: Circumstantial evidence links gut dysbiosis and HTN. Gut pathology, apparent in animal HTN models, has not been fully investigated in hypertensive patients. Objective evidence and an understanding of mechanisms could have a major impact for new antihypertensive therapies and/or improved applications of current ones.

Norovirus is a major etiologic agent in worldwide outbreaks of gastroenteritis associated with food as well as person‐to‐person transmission. The ubiquitous nature of Norovirus necessitates simple and rapid detection methods with high accuracy and sensitivity. To this end, several investigators have evaluated the usefulness of commercial reverse‐transcription loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP) kits for detecting Norovirus genogroups I (GI) and II (GII). In previous studies, the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII showed a relatively high detection rate, while that for Norovirus GI showed a relatively low detection rate. In the present study, clinical Norovirus specimens were used to compare the detection rate of a modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI with the rates of the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI and an “in‐house” RT‐LAMP GI primer set, methods which had a high detection rate. Results from the present study showed that the modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI had a higher detection rate for two viral genotypes (GI.3, GI.11). On comparison with an “in‐house” GII primer set using genotype GII.4 viruses circulating recently, the detection rate by the Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII was found to be higher, with a 98% detection rate. These results indicate the applicability of the modified LAMP kit for GI and the conventional LAMP kit for GII for detection of Noroviruses in clinical samples. J. Med.

Since the first reports in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly developed into a pandemic associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that may be triggered by various bacterial and viral infections. Reports on possible neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce. Hereby, we report a case of GBS after an infection with SARS-CoV-2.

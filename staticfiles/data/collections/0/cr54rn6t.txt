Abstract Antibodies are major molecular effectors of adaptive immune responses. Most, if not all, biological activities of antibodies, however, depend on the functional properties of cells that express receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies (FcR). Most FcR are activating receptors; some are inhibitory. When engaged by antibodies and antigen, the various FcR expressed by a given cell trigger a mixture of positive and negative signals whose integration determines cellular responses. Responses of cell populations can be either protective or pathogenic. As a consequence, FcR are potential target/tools in a variety of diseases including infection, allergy, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

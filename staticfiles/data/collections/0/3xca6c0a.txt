An account is given of the recent development of the highly viscous complex biopharmaceuticals in relation to syringeability and injectability. The specific objective of this study is to establish a convenient method to examine problem of the injectability for the needle-syringe-formulation system when complex formulations with diverse viscosities are used. This work presents the inter-relationship between needle size, syringe volume, viscosity, and injectability of polymeric solutions having typical viscosities encountered in concentrated biologics, by applying a constant probe crosshead speed on the plunger-syringe needle assembly and continuously recording the force-distance profiles. A computerized texture analyzer was used to accurately capture, display, and store force, displacement, and time data. The force-distance curve and area under the curve are determined, and total work done for complete extrusion of the syringe content was calculated automatically by applying an established Matlab program. Various concentrations (i.e., 0.5-4% w/v of polymeric fluids/dispersions) of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with viscosity ranges of 5-100 cP mimicking concentrated monoclonal antibody solutions and complex biopharmaceutical formulations are investigated. Results indicate that calculated values of total work done to completely extrude the syringe content are the most appropriate parameter that describes viscosity-injection force of dispersed formulations. Additionally, the rheological properties of HPMC and PEO fluids in the context of syringeability and injectability are discussed.

Several studies show that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the lowest vitamin D concentration among all breast cancer types, suggesting that this vitamin may induce a protective effect against TNBC. This effect of the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D), can be attributed to its potential to modulate proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis and is supported by many in vitro and animal studies, but its exact mechanism is poorly known. In a fraction of TNBCs that harbor mutations that cause the loss of function of the DNA repair-associated breast cancer type 1 susceptibility (BRCA1) gene, 1,25(OH)2D may induce protective effects by activating its receptor and inactivating cathepsin L-mediated degradation of tumor protein P53 binding protein 1 (TP53BP1), preventing deficiency in DNA double-strand break repair and contributing to genome stability. Similar effects can be induced by the interaction of 1,25(OH)2D with proteins of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 (GADD45) family. Further studies on TNBC cell lines with exact molecular characteristics and clinical trials with well-defined cases are needed to determine the mechanism of action of vitamin D in TNBC to assess its preventive and therapeutic potential.

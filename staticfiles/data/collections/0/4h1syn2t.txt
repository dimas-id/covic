Previous virological and immunological studies have suggested that multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto-immune disease triggered by a virus infection. In order to inhibit the growth of measles virus in the patient's jejunum, we obtained an IgA-rich cow colostrum containing anti-measles lactoglobulin resistant to proteases. This colostrum was orally administered to patients with MS to investigate its effect on the course of the disease. Measles-positive antibody colostrum was orally administered every morning to 15 patients with MS at a daily dosage of 100 ml for 30 days. Similarly, measles-negative antibody (< 8) control colostrum was orally administered to 5 patients. As a clinical assessment, disability scores developed by the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies were used. As a result, of 7 high NT titre (512–5120) anti-measles colostrum recipients 5 patients improved and 2 remained unchanged. Among 8 low NT titre (8–32) anti-measles colostrum recipients 5 patients improved and 3 remained unchanged. However, of 5 negative NT titre (< 8) colostrum recipients 2 patients remained unchanged and 3 worsened. No side-effects were observed in colostrum recipients. These findings suggest the efficacy of orally administered anti-measles colostrum in improving the condition of MS patients (P < 0.05).

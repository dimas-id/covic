Abstract Zika virus outbreaks have been explosive and unpredictable and have led to significant adverse health effectsâ€”as well as considerable public anxiety. Significant scientific work has resulted in multiple candidate vaccines that are now undergoing further clinical development, with several vaccines now in phase 2 clinical trials. In this review, we survey current vaccine efforts, preclinical and clinical results, and ethical and other concerns that directly bear on vaccine development. It is clear that the world needs safe and effective vaccines to protect against Zika virus infection. Whether such vaccines can be developed through to licensure and public availability absent significant financial investment by countries, and other barriers discussed within this article, remains uncertain.

A self-administered validated (Cronbach alpha= 0.077) questionnaire was used to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among HCPs in Pakistan regarding COVID-19. Findings showed HCPs had good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (8.43Â±1.78) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) regarding COVID-19. HCPs perceived that limited infection control material (50.7%, n=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, n=168) are the major barriers in infection control practice. Regression analysis indicated pharmacist role (OR: 2.247, 95% CI: 1.11-4.55, P=0.025) was the substantial determinant of good practice. HCPs in Pakistan have good knowledge, yet, there were areas where gaps in knowledge and practice were observed.

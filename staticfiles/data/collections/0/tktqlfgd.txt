Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate. The SARS-CoV outbreak was controlled by public health measures alone. However, emergence or re-emergence of CoV from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health.

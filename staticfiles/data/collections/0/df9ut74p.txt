OBJECTIVE Thyroid surgery is a common basic procedure in otorhinolaryngology. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficiency of using a new LigaSure(®) vessel sealing system (LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument; Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA). METHODS We evaluated 83 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between July 2009 and June 2012. The patients were allocated to two groups, which underwent thyroid surgery using either the LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument or conventional techniques. We investigated the duration of operation, estimated blood loss, pathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay. As for duration of operation and estimated blood loss, we also performed analyses by subgroups according to the extent of thyroid resection, as either total thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy. RESULTS The study groups showed no significant differences in age, sex, indications, extent of operation and estimated blood loss. Complication rates for recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, hypoparathyroidism, hematoma, and wound infection did not differ between groups, except for temporary hypoparathyroidism. Operation time was significantly shorter in the LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument group than in the conventional group for all extents of thyroid resection. CONCLUSION Use of the LigaSure(®) Small Jaw Instrument seems likely to reduce the operating time for thyroid surgery without increasing estimated blood loss or the frequency of postoperative complications compared to conventional techniques.

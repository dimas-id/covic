BACKGROUND The surgical master class is a traditional method for a surgeon to learn new operations. However, there is limited evidence to support that it can help a surgeon adopt a new technique. The aim of this study was to investigate the adoption of surgical techniques after attendance at a surgical master class. METHODS A questionnaire was sent to surgeons attending surgical master classes in laparoscopic bariatric and colorectal surgery. The questionnaire examined operative experience before attending the master class and the consequent adoption of techniques. RESULTS There was a significant adoption of colorectal procedures, from 33% to 79% (P = .00011), and bariatric procedures, from 27% to 66% (P = .014), after attendance at the surgical master classes. CONCLUSIONS This study shows a significant increase in surgeons' performing advanced surgical procedures after attendance at a surgical master class. This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the master class in terms of surgeons' adopting new techniques.

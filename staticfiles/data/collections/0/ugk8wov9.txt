Abstract Virus-specific memory T cell populations demonstrate plasticity in antigenic and functional phenotype, in recognition of antigen, and in their ability to accommodate new memory T cell populations. The adaptability of complex antigen-specific T cell repertoires allows the host to respond to a diverse array of pathogens and accommodate memory pools to many pathogens in a finite immune system. This is in part accounted for by crossreactive memory T cells, which can be employed in immune responses and mediate protective immunity or life-threatening immunopathology.

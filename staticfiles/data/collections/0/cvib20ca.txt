Abstract The current status of isotope-assisted multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for protein structural studies is reviewed. After introducing various classic isotope labeling methods, some new emerging technologies, such as the stereo-array isotope labeling method, are described. The concomitant development of advanced stable isotope labeling strategies, NMR instrumentation, sophisticated NMR measurements, spectral analysis, and structural calculation algorithms is essential to overcome the current limitations restricting the use of protein NMR spectroscopy.

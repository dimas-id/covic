Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused thousands of human infections worldwide and hundreds of deaths in just a few months. Evidence indicates that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been circulating from animals to humans since before the 2002-2003 outbreak, suggesting that another pandemic may occur. This possibility has focused continuous action on SARS vaccine research. Inactivated vaccines, viral and bacterial vector vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and live-attenuated virus vaccines have been studied in different animal models. Although different animal models are used in vaccine studies, the most appropriate model for studying SARS is ferret since it develops the typical clinical signs, viral replication patterns and lung pathology compatible with that of SARS pathogenesis in humans. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge. Moreover, potential vaccine enhancement of SARS have also been shown in some studies. Data from the studies give an important information of the demand for further vaccine development research, especially focusing on mucosal immunization, T-cell immunity and combinations of heterologous vaccines in prime-boost regimens. In this review article developments on SARS vaccines have been discussed under the light of recent literature.

Various prototype viruses and original specimens were comparatively titrated in cell cultures at 33‡ and 37‡ C. Higher titers at 37‡ were consistently obtained with adenoviruses; for other viruses (enteroviruses, herpesvirus hominis, vaccinia virus, parainfluenza viruses) the titers were mostly identical at either temperature. Original specimens and prototype strains showed the same behavior. The habit to cultivate viruses from throat swabs at 33‡ C is unsatisfactory for adenoviruses.

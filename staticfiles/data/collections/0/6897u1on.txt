BACKGROUND Several trials showed that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is superior to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the treatment of acute cholecystitis. However actual practice does not conform to current evidence. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes and total hospital costs between early and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients with acute cholecystitis that underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institutions was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the treatment received and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS The study included 91 patients, 52 female and 39 male, with a mean age of 55. Early surgery was performed in 32 cases and delayed surgery in 59 cases. The two groups were comparable for demographics data and severity of disease on admission. There was a no significant difference (p = 0.174) in the mean operative time between early (54.8 min) and delayed group (47.8 min). Conversion rate was higher in the early group (34.3% vs. 20.3%), but difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.223). The overall complications rate was comparable (18.7% early vs. 16.9% delayed, p = 0.941). Length of postoperative stay (4.3 vs. 3.8 days) was similar (p = 0.437), but total hospital stay was significantly 4 days shorter in the early group (p < 0.0001). The mean total cost was higher for the delayed group (4171 vs. 6041), with a significant difference of 1870 Euro (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy has an outcome comparable to the delayed procedure, with a shorter total hospital stay and lower total costs, and it should be considered as the preferred approach in treatment of acute cholecystitis.

BACKGROUND Radical prostatectomy is a common surgical procedure performed to treat prostate cancer. Patient-reported outcomes after surgery include urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, decreased quality of life and psychological effects. Predictive tools to assess the likelihood of an individual experiencing various patient-reported outcomes have been developed to aid decision-making when selecting treatment. METHODS A systematic review was undertaken to identify all papers describing tools for the prediction of patient-reported outcome measures in men with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. To be eligible for inclusion, papers had to provide a summary measure of accuracy. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from July 2007. Title/abstract screening, and full-text review were undertaken by two reviewers, while data extraction and critical appraisal was performed by a single reviewer. RESULTS The search strategy identified 3217 potential studies, of which 191 progressed to full-text review and 14 were included. From these studies, 27 tools in total were identified, of which 18 predicted urinary symptoms, six predicted erectile function and one predicted freedom from a group of three outcomes ('trifecta') (biochemical recurrence, incontinence and erectile dysfunction). On the basis of tool accuracy (>70%) and external validation, two tools predicting incontinence and two tools predicting erectile dysfunction are ready for implementation. CONCLUSIONS A small number of tools for the prediction of patient-reported outcomes following radical prostatectomy have been developed. Four tools were found to have adequate accuracy and validation and are ready for implementation for the prediction of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

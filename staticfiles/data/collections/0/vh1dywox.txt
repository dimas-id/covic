Abstract Southeast Asia exhibits an enormous diversity in types and levels of sophistication of e-government. Singapore has one of the world's best-developed systems. At the other end of this spectrum lie impoverished states such as Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar, where e-government barely exists. Malaysia and Thailand occupy positions in between. The Philippines is an interesting case where e-government centers largely around text messaging.

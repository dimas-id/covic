Mitochondria have a central role in regulating a range of cellular activities and host responses upon bacterial infection. Multiple pathogens affect mitochondria dynamics and functions to influence their intracellular survival or evade host immunity. On the other side, major host responses elicited against infections are directly dependent on mitochondrial functions, thus placing mitochondria centrally in maintaining homeostasis upon infection. In this review, we summarize how different bacteria and viruses impact morphological and functional changes in host mitochondria and how this manipulation can influence microbial pathogenesis as well as the host cell metabolism and immune responses.

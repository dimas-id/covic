OBJECTIVES To provide a priority algorithm for determinate diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up procedures regarding at testicular cancer, adjusted by institutional requirements. Testicular cancer patient assessment during COVID-19 Pandemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS Review of relevant manuscript published up to date, draft creation correctedt hough modified nominal group until final corrected manuscript. RESULTS A lack of scientific evidence exists through a large amount of manuscripts. The authors support prioritizing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Once priorities have been established, that will facilitate providing each patients the limited resources. Initial diagnostic procedures for testicular cancer such as scrotal US, orchiectomy, staging CT and adjuvant treatment (if required) are priority. Reducing the usage of chemotherapy with respiratory toxicity and increasing the usage ofgrowth factors during chemotherapy treatment are the main stakeholders of treatment. Besides, providing active surveillance on non-risk factor clinical stage I is alsoa priority. In case of positive COVID-19, it is important to high light that the vast majority of patients are tentatively cured. CONCLUSIONS During de-escalation phases, patients diagnosed with testicular cancer should receive priority care during initial assessment. The follow-ups of patients with low -risk and without recurrence for a long time, might be delayed.

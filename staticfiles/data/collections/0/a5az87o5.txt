In 169 Finnish infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age <6 months in 2008-2010, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested by polymerase chain reaction for Bordetella pertussis and 16 viruses. Respiratory viruses were detected in 89% (71% with respiratory syncytial virus), but no infant had B. pertussis. The latter finding may reflect a positive effect from the broadening of the Finnish pertussis vaccination program in 2005.

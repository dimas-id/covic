Microbial components and the endogenous molecules released from damaged cells can stimulate germ-line-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to transduce signals to the hub of the innate immune signaling network-the adaptor proteins MyD88/TRIF/MAVS/STING/Caspase-1, where integrated signals relay to the relevant transcription factors IRF3/IRF7/NF-ÎºB/ AP-1 and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) to trigger the expression of type I interferons and inflammatory cytokines or the assembly of inflammasomes. Most pleiotropic cytokines are secreted and bind to specific receptors, activating the signaling pathways including JAK-STAT for the proliferation, differentiation and functional capacity of immune cells. This review focuses on several critical adaptors in innate immune signaling cascades and recent progress in their molecular mechanisms.

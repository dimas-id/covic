In recent studies, cyclosporine has been used for the treatment of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The results of these studies were variable. We report on a patient who was treated for 6 years with cyclosporine after kidney transplantation. He developed chronic distal colitis with all the features of ulcerative colitis. An infectious etiology of the colitis was carefully excluded. High-dose treatment with methylprednisolone was required to induce remission. This report shows that immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine did not prevent the development of ulcerative colitis in this patient.

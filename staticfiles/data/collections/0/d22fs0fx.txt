Cedar virus (CedV) is a bat-borne henipavirus related to Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), zoonotic agents of fatal human disease. CedV receptor-binding protein (G) shares only âˆ¼30% sequence identity with those of NiV and HeV, although they can all use ephrin-B2 as an entry receptor. We demonstrate that CedV also enters cells through additional B- and A-class ephrins (ephrin-B1, ephrin-A2, and ephrin-A5) and report the crystal structure of the CedV G ectodomain alone and in complex with ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2. The CedV G receptor-binding site is structurally distinct from other henipaviruses, underlying its capability to accommodate additional ephrin receptors. We also show that CedV can enter cells through mouse ephrin-A1 but not human ephrin-A1, which differ by 1 residue in the key contact region. This is evidence of species specific ephrin receptor usage by a henipavirus, and implicates additional ephrin receptors in potential zoonotic transmission.

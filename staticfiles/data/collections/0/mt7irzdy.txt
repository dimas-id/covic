Theories of risk in society have defined and extrapolated on risk in multiple ways depending on the object of study and types of claims made by the author. Zinn (2008b) lists six main traditions, including risk society, cultural turn, and governmentality. One of the central problems that more recent work on risk has focused on is how risk varies according to the fabric of particular everyday lives in particular societies and under various types of social arrangements (Tulloch and Lupton, 2003; Tulloch, 2004). In this chapter I explore this problem of risk theory by looking at the views Japanese young people have about risk in Japanese society.

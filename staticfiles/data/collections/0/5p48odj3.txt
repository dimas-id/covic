OBJECTIVE For laparoscopic low anterior resection of the rectum, a small additional incision is needed to extract the specimen. We describe an adjustment technique, which inserted the anvil and extracted the specimen through transanal pathway. METHODS Between July 2010 and July 2012, 23 patients underwent laparoscopic rectal surgery with transanal anvil insertion and transanal prolapsing specimen extraction. All perioperative data and short-term outcomes were recorded in a database. RESULTS The mean patient age was 61.3 years (range 47-68 years). Of the 23 patients, 17 underwent resection for rectal carcinoma and 6 had tubulovillous adenomas. No intraoperative complications occurred. The mean operative time was 137 minutes (range 118-170 minutes). The distal margins, circumferential resection margins, and lymph node dissections were oncologically adequate for all malignancies. One patient experienced anastomotic leakage (4.3%), treated conservatively. One male patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia suffered from postoperative urinary retention. The average postoperative hospital stay was 11.3 days (range 7-21 days). No patients experienced anal dysfunction. At a median follow-up of 26 months, there were no tumor recurrences. CONCLUSION The technique of transanal prolapsing specimen extraction for laparoscopic low anterior resection of the rectum is feasible and safe for selected patients.

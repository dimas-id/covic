BACKGROUND In late 2019 a viral pneumonia began to spread across the world. The viral disease, COVID-19, is now officially a pandemic, causing concern for the potential risk of systemic therapies for patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review is to analyze what is currently known about COVID-19 in regard to the safety of systemic treatment, and to provide guidelines for use in psoriasis during this pandemic. METHODS Review of guidelines from various dermatologic regulatory bodies regarding the use of systemic medications during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed and summarized. RESULTS The AAD,NPF and IPC are in agreement regarding their recommendation that patients with active COVID-19 infection should discontinue any biologic therapy. CONCLUSION Patients with active COVID-19 infections should discontinue systemic treatment for psoriasis. Patients with risk factors should discuss continuing treatment on a case by case basis.

Abstract Paediatric otolaryngology practice involves examining and operating in anatomical locations with high levels of aerosol generation and transmission of COVID-19 to treating clinicians, especially from the asymptomatic patient populations including children. During the COVID-19 pandemic all emergent otolaryngological conditions affecting the airway, oral, and nasal cavities should be managed medically where possible and any operating deferred. We present guidelines for operating on paediatric otolaryngological patients when necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic, and incorporate experience gathered during microlaryngobronchoscopy on a COVID-19 positive infant at our institution.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy on peritoneal fluid values in mares and compare how this effect was modified by the method of ovarian vessel hemostasis used. Ten mares undergoing standing bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy were used in a randomized clinical study. During surgery, blood vessels within the mesovarium were either: (1) sealed and transected with a vessel sealing and dividing device (VSDD), or (2) ligated using two loops placed proximal to each ovary and then the mesovarium transected using laparoscopic scissors. The ovaries were removed through the ipsilateral body wall. Abdominocentesis was performed before surgery and 24 h and 72 h after surgery. Markers of peritoneal inflammation, as measured by total nucleated cell count, total protein (TP) and red blood cell count via abdominocentesis, were consistently increased for all groups compared to pre-operative values. The mean (range) of TP for the VSDD group was 4.14 (3.9-4.5) g/dL, and that for the ligating loop group was 3.18 (2.7-3.5) g/dL. Use of the VSDD resulted in significantly greater TP concentrations in the abdominal fluid at 24 h and 72 h post-operatively when compared to a ligating loop (P <0.001 and 0.04, respectively).

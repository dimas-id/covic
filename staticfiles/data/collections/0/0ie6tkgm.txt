For COVID-19 the Infection Fatality Rate or IFR - a crucial variable in epidemiological modeling - is difficult to estimate because many cases are asymptomatic and the overall infection rate is generally not known. Circumstances in the Italian provinces of Milano, Bergamo, Brescia, and Lodi allow estimation of lower bounds for age- and sex-specific all-cause excess mortality (a proxy for IFR) since anecdotal reports indicate some towns were close to fully infected. Using data from ISTAT on mortality from January 1 through April 15 for 2020 and the three preceding years, I estimate excess mortality by sex and age categories (0-14, 15-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years) while controlling for town-specific mortality that proxies for town-specific infection rate. The 99th percentile from the tail of the town distribution gives a lower-bound estimate for COVID-19 mortality. The overall population-weighted mortality at the 99th percentile is 1.09 percent (95% CI 1.06-1.14). The age- and sex-specific rates vary considerably: for men age 65-74 the estimate is 2.10 percent (95% CI 1.94-2.28) which is 3.5-times higher than men 55-64 and 2.7-times higher than women 65-74.

In this chapter we discuss changing approaches to viral discovery and human health, summarize the current understanding of the human-associated viral community, and review contemporary methods in viral metagenomics. The virome is the community of viruses that populate an organism or ecosystem at any given time. This includes the “core” set of commensal viruses that do not give rise to clinical symptoms or viremia, combined with any acute or persistent infections that may be present. Recent technological advances enable us to sequence viral genomes without culturing or cloning. These methods permit not only the discovery of a wider range of viral pathogens, but also a broader assessment of the human virome in the absence of clinically recognized disease. A new focus in contemporary virology is the natural viral community of the human body. This will provide a background for recognition of emerging and previously unrecognized viruses. It should be possible to detect viral infection before the emergence of symptoms, which will have significant implications for health-care delivery.

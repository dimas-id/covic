PURPOSE: To examine the rate of occurrence of hearing impairments among the infants who had recovered from viral meningitis under 1 year of age through auditory evoked potential (AEP) test and to investigate the efficacy of the follow-up AEP test in viral meningitis infants. METHODS: Two hundred twenty infants (440 ears) were examined through AEP test once, and 47 (94 ears) of them went back for a second examination and were diagnosed with viral meningitis. The first AEP tests were compared with the second results in 47 infants. I latency, V latency, I-III interpeak latency (IPL), and III-V IPL were checked. RESULTS: In the first AEP test conducted on 440 ears, the average values of I and V latency and I-III IPL were delayed as compared with normal values. The second AEP results were conducted on 47 infants 92.36 days after the first exam. I latency and V latency of second exam were improved significantly (p < 0.05), but I-III and III-V IPL showed no significant changes. Two hearing impaired patients (4 ears) were confirmed through chart reviews. CONCLUSION: The AEP test is a helpful study for early detection of hearing problem. However, in this study, AEP test was too sensitive in acute period, and later, the incidence rate of hearing impairment was relatively low. Therefore, age of onset, severity of neurologic symptom, and clinical examination must be considered before the AEP test.

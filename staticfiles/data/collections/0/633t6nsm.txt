AIM The management of haemorrhoids has changed significantly in the last two decades as a result of new insights into their pathophysiology and the availability of new surgical devices. The aim of this survey was to evaluate changes in the management of haemorrhoids in Italy over the last 17 years. METHOD An electronic database which recorded details of management relating to the severity of haemorrhoids between 2000 and 2016 was obtained from 18 of 34 colorectal surgeons who were invited to participate. RESULTS A total of 32 458 patients were treated for haemorrhoids by 18 expert coloproctologists during a 17-year period. Patients were classified as Grade II (7542, 23.2%), Grade III(15 360, 47.3%) and Grade IV (9556, 29.4%). Grade II haemorrhoids were treated with rubber band ligation in over 90% of the cases, and patients with Grade IV had a Milligan-Morgan (MM) haemorrhoidectomy in over 90% of the cases. In Grade III, the use of stapled haemorrhoidopexy progressively decreased from 30% to 35% (between 2000 and 2007) to 5% of the cases. Meanwhile, commencing from 2006 the use of Doppler-guided haemorrhoid artery ligation (DGHAL) with mucopexy increased progressively from 6% to 24%. Over the years, the percentage of MM haemorrhoidectomy remained consistent at between 65% and 70% of the cases. CONCLUSION Relevant changes in the surgical choice of haemorrhoid treatment have occurred in Italy over the last 17 years. MM haemorrhoidectomy remains the most frequently performed procedure for Grade III haemorrhoids. Stapled haemorrhoidopexy has become much less popular in contrast to DGHAL with mucopexy which is being performed much more frequently.

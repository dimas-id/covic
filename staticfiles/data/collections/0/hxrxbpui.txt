An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method based on a novel multi-epitope antigen of S protein (SE) was developed for antibodies detection against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The multi-epitope antigen SE protein was designed by arranging three S gene fragments (166-247 aa, S1 gene; 501-515 aa, S1 gene; 8-30 aa, S2 gene) in tandem. It was identified to be approximately 32 kDa as a His-tagged fusion protein and can bind IBV positive serum by western blot analysis. The conditions of the SE-ELISA method were optimized. The optimal concentration of the coating antigen SE was 3.689 Î¼g/mL and the dilution of the primary antibodies was identified as 1:1000 using a checkerboard titration. The cut-off OD450 value was established at 0.332. The relative sensitivity and specificity between the SE-ELISA and IDEXX ELISA kit were 92.38 and 89.83%, respectively, with an accuracy of 91.46%. This assay is sensitive and specific for detection of antibodies against IBV.

BACKGROUND Midface reconstruction of oncologic defects is one of the most challenging problems in plastic surgery. Over time, the senior author (P.G.C.) has developed modifications in his technique for oncologic midface reconstruction to minimize complications and maximize outcomes. METHODS Over a 15-year period (1992 to 2006), 100 flaps for midface oncologic reconstruction were performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The first 50 flaps were performed from 1992 to 2000, and the second 50 flaps were performed from 2001 to 2006. Over time, technical improvements were made in the following areas: palate, dental implants and prosthesis, orbital floor, eyelid, nasal sidewall, lips, cranial base and dura, and pedicle anastomosis. Using a prospectively maintained database, the authors compared the functional and aesthetic outcomes of the first 50 flaps and the second 50 flaps. RESULTS Improvements in palatal reconstruction increased the proportion of patients who achieved normal speech from 38.9 percent in the first half of the series (1992 to 2000) to 50 percent in the second half of the series (2001 to 2006). The percentage of patients who were able to tolerate an unrestricted diet increased from 44.4 to 52 percent. The use of new methods to reconstruct the orbital floor also lowered the ectropion rate from 71.4 to 47.6 percent. The percentage of patients whose aesthetic results were judged as "excellent" increased from 12 to 58.6 percent. CONCLUSIONS Over the last 15 years, the senior author has refined methods of midface reconstruction that have improved functional and aesthetic outcomes. These technical advancements have made it possible to obtain better and more consistent results. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic, IV.

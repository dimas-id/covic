Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel phlebovirus, is associated with high fatality. Therapeutic interventions are lacking and disease pathogenesis is yet to be fully elucidated. The anti-viral immune response has been reported, but humoral involvement in viral pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here we show defective serological responses to SFTSV is associated with disease fatality and a combination of B-cell and T-cell impairment contribute to disruption of anti-viral immunity. The serological profile in deceased patients is characterized by absence of specific IgG to viral nucleocapsid and glycoprotein due to failure of B-cell class switching. Expansion and impairment of antibody secretion is a signature of fatal SFTSV infection. Apoptosis of monocytes in the early stage of infection diminishes antigen-presentation by dendritic cells, impedes differentiation and function of T follicular helper cells, and contributes to failure of the virus-specific humoral response.

Short Summary: Graduation decisions are weighty and sometimes difficult, even under normal circumstances. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has imposed highly abnormal circumstances, leaving the program director with less than the usual amount of data to inform 2020 graduation decisions. Nevertheless, the program director is obligated to the program, the sponsoring institution, the residents/fellows and, most importantly, to the public to graduate only those residents/fellows who are truly prepared to safely and independently practice their specialty.

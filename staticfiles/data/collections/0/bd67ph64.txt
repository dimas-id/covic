ABSTRACT‐ A population‐based study of the prevalence and risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS) was conducted in the Hautes‐Pyrénées, the southwestern region of France. The prevalence rate per 100,000 was equal to 40. Data on the past medical history of 63 MS patients and matched controls were collected. The frequency and age at occurrence of common childhood infections were similar for both the MS cases and controls. There was no difference between the frequency of vaccination for MS patients and for controls. However, the age at which MS patients were immunized against poliomyelitis was significantly higher than the corresponding age for controls (15.8 years versus 8.9 years, P < 0.01). Antibody titers for various viruses were measured. The mumps antibody titer was significantly higher in the MS patients than in the controls. Also, MS patients tended to have higher titers for measles antibodies.

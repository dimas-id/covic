Psychological manifestations such as depression and suicidal ideation are commonly caused by poorly controlled pain, anxiety, and sleep deprivation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We are concerned that previous analgesic and sedative techniques administered as single-medication approaches are outdated and inadequate. It is imperative that ICU practitioners are knowledgeable in multimodal approaches to pain and sedation in high acuity settings. We have shown that appropriate combinations of ketamine and fentanyl are effective, and if further supplementation is needed, we utilize additional pharmacological agents in low doses and regional techniques that ultimately lower the overall opioid consumption. We acknowledge that a variety of medication supplementations tailored to the patient’s clinical needs and nature of surgery improves a patient’s outcome in ICU and overall quality of life.

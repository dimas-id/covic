BACKGROUND The surgical treatment of large midline incisional hernias remains a challenge. The aim of this report is to present the results of a new technique for large midline incisional hernia repair which combines the components-separation technique with a double-prosthetic-mesh repair. METHODS The records of all consecutive patients who received a double-mesh combined with the components-separation technique for ventral hernia repair were reviewed. The clinical, surgical, and follow-up data were analyzed. RESULTS Nine patients [3 women, 6 men; median age = 62 years (range = 26-77)] were included in the study. Median transverse defect size was 20 cm (range = 15-25). The median duration of hospital stay was 8 days (range = 5-17). Postoperative complications occurred in 66% (6/9). Follow-up [median = 13 months (range = 3-49)] showed no recurrent hernias, but one patient had a small hernia after a relaparotomy for colon carcinoma recurrence. The overall occurrence of wound infections was 44% (4/9). There was no mortality. CONCLUSION The components-separation technique in combination with a double-mesh has shown a low recurrence rate in the short-term follow-up. However, there is a considerable occurrence of postoperative wound infections. Long-term results of the hernia recurrence rate have to be awaited.

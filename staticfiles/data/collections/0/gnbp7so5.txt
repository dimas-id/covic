We tested 104 residents and 141 staff for COVID-19 who failed daily symptom screening in homeless shelters in Hamilton, Canada. We detected one resident (1%), seven staff (5%) and one case of secondary spread. Shelter restructuring to allow physical distancing, testing and isolation can decrease outbreaks in shelters.

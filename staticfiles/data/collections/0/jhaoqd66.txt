Lipidic nanoparticulate self-assembled structures are effective carriers for drug delivery. This chapter describes the most famous nanotechnological drug delivery systems that are already used in clinical practice and clinical evaluation or in academic research. Liposomes are nanocolloidal lyotropic liquid crystals that are able to deliver bioactive molecules. Their membrane biophysics and thermodynamic properties reflect to the creation of metastable phases that affect their functionality and physicochemical behavior. Thermo- and pH-responsive liposomes are innovative nanotechnological platforms for drug delivery and targeting. Polymeric micelles and polymersomes are nanostructures that are promising drug carriers, while dendrimeric structures are considered as real nanoparticulate systems that are used in drug delivery and as nonviral vectors as well as in prevention of serious infections leading to diseases. Vaccines based on nanoparticles such as liposomes are an emerging technology and liposomes seem to meet the requirement criteria of adjuvanicity.

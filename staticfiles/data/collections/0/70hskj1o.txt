We are all together in a fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Chatbots, if effectively designed and deployed, could help us by sharing up-to-date information quickly, encouraging desired health impacting behaviors, and lessening the psychological damage caused by fear and isolation. Despite this potential, the risk of amplifying misinformation and the lack of prior effectiveness research is cause for concern. Immediate collaborations between healthcare workers, companies, academics and governments are merited and may aid future pandemic preparedness efforts.

In this work we show using atomistic simulations that the biased diffusion in high electric field gradients creates a mechanism whereby nanotips may start growing from small surface asperities. It has long been known that atoms on a metallic surface have biased diffusion if electric fields are applied and that microscopic tips may be sharpened using fields, but the exact mechanisms have not been well understood. Our Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation model uses a recently developed theory for how the migration barriers are affected by the presence of an electric field. All parameters of the model are physically motivated and no fitting parameters are used. The model has been validated by reproducing characteristic faceting patterns of tungsten surfaces that have in previous experiments been observed to only appear in the presence of strong electric fields. The growth effect is found to be enhanced by increasing fields and temperatures.

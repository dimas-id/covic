PURPOSE A single surgeon skilled in conventional laparoscopic surgery used laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) to treat benign urological diseases. This study reports our surgical results and introduces a simple technique with tips based on our experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS LESS surgery was performed on 116 patients by use of a homemade single-port device composed of an Alexis wound retractor and a powder-free surgical glove. Cases were 44 varicocelectomies (including 8 bilateral cases), 38 renal cyst marsupializations (including 3 bilateral cases), 26 ureterolithotomies (with 1 concomitant ureterolithotomy and contralateral renal cyst marsupialization), 4 prostatic enucleations, and 4 bladder rupture repairs. The mean patient age was 44.43±16.46 years (range, 11 to 76 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 87:29. RESULTS In one ureterolithotomy case, LESS was converted to conventional laparoscopic surgery. The mean operative time was 87.03±45.03 minutes, the estimated blood loss was 61.90 ml (range, 0 to 2,000 ml), and the mean hospital stay was 3.03±2.12 days. Two patients underwent single-port transvesical enucleation of the prostate (STEP) requiring patient-controlled anesthesia. No patients developed major complications, and all patients were satisfied, with 75.86% expressing a high degree of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS We report successful treatment outcomes for LESS in 116 cases of benign urological disease. Our findings suggest that LESS can replace conventional laparoscopy.

Accurate digital twinning of the global challenges (GC) leads to computationally expensive coupled simulations. These simulations bring together not only different models, but also various sources of massive static and streaming data sets. In this paper, we explore ways to bridge the gap between traditional high performance computing (HPC) and data-centric computation in order to provide efficient technological solutions for accurate policy-making in the domain of GC. GC simulations in HPC environments give rise to a number of technical challenges related to coupling. Being intended to reflect current and upcoming situation for policy-making, GC simulations extensively use recent streaming data coming from external data sources, which requires changing traditional HPC systems operation. Another common challenge stems from the necessity to couple simulations and exchange data across data centers in GC scenarios. By introducing a generalized GC simulation workflow, this paper shows commonality of the technical challenges for various GC and reflects on the approaches to tackle these technical challenges in the HiDALGO project.

We read with great interest the review article by Matricardi and colleagues [1] depicting mechanisms of disease for COVID‐19 and analyzing both viral and host factors influencing its course. We particularly agree with Authors on the pivotal role of innate immunity in the very early phase of disease, being crucial for the subsequent evolution. Most known weapons of innate immune system are represented by natural antibodies, non‐specific antimicrobial proteins, interferons, cytokines and cellular elements (i.e. natural killer cells).[1] However, innate immunity could be influenced by other, still underrecognized, factors.

We report on technical modifications we developed for thoracoscopic esophagoesophagostomy in patients with esophageal atresia. They are: (1) placing stay sutures along the edges of the atretic esophagi and exteriorizing them through the thoracic wall to expose the luminal surfaces of the esophagi nicely and relieve tension on the anastomosis; (2) leaving 1/5 of the length of the distal and proximal ends of the atretic esophagi intact before placing the stay sutures, to avoid retraction of the mucosa into the lumen; (3) making the diameter of the proximal esophagus 1.5-2 times larger than the diameter of the distal esophagus to make the shape of the anastomosis more streamlined without notching.

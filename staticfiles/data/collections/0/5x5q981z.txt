The structural and intracellular proteins of the murine hepatitis viruses MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 were studied by tryptic peptide mapping. The results demonstrated that the virions contained three distinct proteins: the two related chains of the E2 complex, the nucleocapsid protein and the heterogeneous E1 complex. Five distinct virus-specific proteins were synthesized by infected cells. Three of the five intracellular proteins contained tryptic-peptides with properties similar to the three structural proteins. Models describing the evolution of the proteins are proposed. Although the pathogenic properties of MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 differ greatly, the tryptic peptide maps of the corresponding proteins of these MHV strains were remarkably similar.

The main objective of this study is to forecast COVID-19 case in Ethiopiausing the best-fitted model. The time series data of COVID-19 case in Ethiopia from March 14, 2020 to June 05, 2020 were used.To this end, exponential growth, single exponential smoothing method, and doubleexponential smoothing methodwere used. To evaluate the forecasting performance of the model, root mean sum of square error was used. The study showed that double exponential smoothing methods was appropriate in forecasting the future number ofCOVID-19 cases in Ethiopia as dictated by lowest value of root mean sum of square error. The forecasting model shows that the number of coronavirus cases in Ethiopia grows exponentially. The finding of the results would help the concerned stakeholders to make the right decisions based on the information given on forecasts.

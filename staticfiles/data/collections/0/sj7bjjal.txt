A 69-year-old man on maintenance dialysis underwent endovascular therapy for a refractory wound due to critical limb ischemia in the popliteal and below-knee arteries. Because of bulky calcified nodules projecting into the popliteal artery, conventional balloon angioplasty alone did not seem to provide a sufficient lumen area, and we ablated the calcified nodules by using myocardial biopsy forceps for lesion preparation. Under roadmap guidance, we repeated ablation 39 times to carefully tear off the bulky calcified nodules, and subsequently performed balloon angioplasty in the popliteal artery. Neither flow-limiting dissection nor perforation occurred, and a sufficient lumen area was obtained. After treatment of the popliteal artery, conventional endovascular therapy was performed in the below-knee arteries. One month later, the wound was fully epithelialized. We report a case of critical limb ischemia with calcified nodules projecting into the popliteal artery, in which the use of myocardial biopsy forceps led to good results.

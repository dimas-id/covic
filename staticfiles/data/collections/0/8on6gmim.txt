Although the brain is the target organ of general anaesthesia, the utility of intra-operative brain monitoring remains controversial. Ideally, the incorporation of brain monitoring into routine practice would promote the maintenance of an optimal depth of anaesthesia, with an ultimate goal of avoiding the negative outcomes that have been associated with inadequate or excessive anaesthesia. A variety of processed electroencephalogram devices exist, of which the bispectral index is the most widely used, particularly in the research setting. Whether such devices prove to be useful will depend not only on their ability to influence anaesthetic management but also on whether the changes they promote can actually affect clinically important outcomes. This review highlights the evidence for the role of bispectral index monitoring, in particular, in guiding anaesthetic management and influencing clinical outcomes, specifically intra-operative awareness, measures of early recovery, mortality and neurocognitive outcomes.

Living-donor liver transplantation was introduced into clinical practice in the early 1990s. At first the results were unsatisfactory, but today's results after living donation are as good as those obtained after conventional liver transplantation with full-sized organs. With minimally invasive diagnostic methods, it is now possible to determine the quality of potential donor livers and exclude focal lesions and anatomical variants which influence the strategy of organ retrieval procedures. Donor liver resection is done without hilar occlusion after determining the anatomical variants of the bile system (especially for right lobes) and localizing of the course of the middle hepatic vein. Microsurgical techniques are used for reconstruction of the biliary system and hepatic vessels. Living-donor liver transplantation allows us to investigate the complex changes after liver resection. The surgical techniques and pathophysiological postoperative changes can be adapted unconventionally to complex oncological liver resections. Therapeutic optimization and better risk management are becoming possible for liver resections.

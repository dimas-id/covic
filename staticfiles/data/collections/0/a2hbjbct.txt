BACKGROUND Several appendiceal stump closure tecniques such as intracorporoeal-knotting, endoloop, stapler and clips are used during laparoscopic appendectomy. This study aimed to compare intracorporoeal-knotting and endoloop tecniques used to close appendiceal stump in laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS This study included patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis in General Surgery Department of Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital between June 2009 and July 2013. The demographics, appendiceal stump closure tecniques, operation time, complications, and length of hospital stays of the patients were compared. RESULTS A total of one hundred and twenty-six patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (Female: 81, Male: 45). Intracorporeal-knotting (Group 1) was performed in sixty-five patients; whereas, endoloop (Group 2) was performed in sixty-one patients in order to close appendiceal stump. The operation time was longer in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (62.0±10.67 min., 56.80±11.94 min., p=0.01). The length of hospital stays were nonsignificant between the groups. Four patients were complicated by superficial surgical site infection in both groups. CONCLUSION In the present study, the operation time was found to be longer for intracorporeal knotting tecnique compared to endoloop tecnique; however, there was no significant difference regarding the length of hospital stay and complications. Performing intracorporeal-knotting technique is suggested since it is cheaper than endoloops and it may also improve hand manipulations of the surgeons who intend to advanced laparoscopy.

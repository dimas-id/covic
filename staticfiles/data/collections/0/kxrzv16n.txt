This article analyzes the current situation in the field of construction and production of pandemic influenza vaccines. The main task of protecting the population against influenza pandemics requires state-of-the-art approaches to the construction of influenza vaccines to be based on reassortment and genetic engineering techniques, including the analysis of primary structures of influenza viral genes, synthesis and cloning of the main viral genes, reverse genetics techniques, and banks of plasmids bearing basic viral genes. Reassortant technologies are now giving way to new approaches for objective reasons. The state-of-the-art technologies provide safety not only at the laboratories where vaccine viruses are constructed but also make the production process wholly safe. We are using the following approaches to the development of industrial production: use of nanoparticles and nanoemulsions as functional adjuvants, construction of totally-safe strains for live attenuated influenza vaccines with deletions of molecular determinants of pathogenicity, application of protein and chemical chaperones to provide self-assembly of haemagglutinin molecules of the H1N1v-2009 virus, and impregnation of whole-virion preparations with nanoparticles to enhance antigenicity.

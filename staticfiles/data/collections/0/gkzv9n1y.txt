Since October 2010, an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has been observed in some provinces of China. Here we report the complete genome sequence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain LC, which was recently isolated from sucking piglets that suffered from severe watery diarrhea in Guangdong. It will help in understanding the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of PEDV in China.

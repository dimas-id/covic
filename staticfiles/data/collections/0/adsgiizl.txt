BACKGROUND Coronavirus (CoV) is the single stranded sense RNA virus that has been known so far with the largest genomic capacity and plenty of natural hosts. In the past dozens of years, SARS-CoV under the branch of the new evolutionary tree has threatens greatly global public health and the severe acute respiratory syndrome new coronavirus (COVID-19) reported in China could cause fatal pathological lesions. Especially in areas with poor medical care, neglect of indirect transmission can cause more serious consequences. METHODS First of all, with reference to SARS-CoV and other relevant studies, the possibility of virus residues on the surface of multiple media is discussed. Further, it is found that the surface residue of this substance may be an important factor in iatrogenic infection. RESULTS This correspondence could point out the direction to study the pathomechanism of COVID-19 infecting human beings. CONCLUSIONS Mucosa exposure and inappropriate treatment of medical and non-medical articles used by the patients all could increase the risks of COVID-19 transmission.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that plays an important role in inducing and modulating an array of immune responses. Cellular responses to IFN-γ are mediated by its heterodimeric cell-surface receptor (IFN-γR), which activates downstream signal transduction cascades, ultimately leading to the regulation of gene expression. In order to study the role of IFN-γ in a number of immune responses and pathways, researchers have generated mice with altered patterns of IFN-γR gene expression. These studies, together with analyses of naturally occurring mutations of the IFN-γR in man, have been instrumental in elucidating the diverse functions of IFN-γ, and are the subject of this review.

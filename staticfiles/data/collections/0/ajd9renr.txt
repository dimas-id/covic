The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has influenced health globally. So far, there are no established management options and prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and those who develop COVID-19. Documented scientific evidences in similar viral outbreaks in past suggested few therapy regimens. These rather have not shown promising results in management of current pandemic. So, in the current review, we are exploring novel treatment strategies and therapies that are being explored and are in clinical and preclinical stages of research. To explore more about the same, we directed our search towards stem cell based, DNA based, or RNA based vaccines against COVID-19 under development by various universities, institutes or pharmaceutical companies. The current scientific literature and database search were performed by exploring various Trials registry (NIH: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and https://www.coronavirus.gov) and Chinese clinical trial registry http://www.chictr.org.cn/) and for preclinical trials various University, Institutions, Pharmaceutical companies websites and news bulletins along with google search were checked routinely from 3rd March 2020 to 16 May 2020. The term “Stem Cell therapy and COVID-19”, “Mesenchymal stem cell and corona 2019 virus”, “DNA Vaccines and COVID-19, RNA Vaccines and COVID-19” and “Cell-based therapy with SARS-CoV-2, University/Institutions and COVID-19 research” were used. The vaccine trials (Stem Cells/DNA/RNA) which were cancelled were not included in this review. Similarly, few others like repurposing of drugs, Nano Vaccines, other miscellaneous trials of Herbs, Music therapy etc., were also excluded. In the present review, we have included the various novel therapies like stem cell therapy, DNA or RNA vaccines which are under development and if proven successful may have a lasting impact on the health industry.

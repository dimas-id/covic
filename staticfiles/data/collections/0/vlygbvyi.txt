Radical cystectomy is associated with significant morbidity. However, the introduction of minimally invasive surgical approaches has attempted to improve perioperative outcomes and decrease surgical complications. Emerging data suggest that robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) might have some advantages compared with open radical cystectomy (ORC). However, the oncologic performance of RARC in patients with locally advanced disease is currently unclear, making it crucial to select patients for the procedure very carefully. No long-term prospective studies comparing the robot-assisted and open techniques have been reported. Until long-term oncologic outcomes of RARC and the results of currently ongoing randomized trials comparing the two techniques become available, ORC remains the gold standard.

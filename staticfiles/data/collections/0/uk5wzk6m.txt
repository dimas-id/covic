Two infants with severe respiratory syncytial virus infection which resulted eventually in classical adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are presented. Both infants had severe apneic spells, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV). Chest radiographs changed after a few days after institution of MV from initial bronchopneumonia like pattern to severe ARDS. Assessment of respiratory system mechanics (single breath occlusion technique) revealed severe restrictive disease in both cases. The first patient recovered with residual restrictive changes determined during a follow-up 2.5 months later, whereas the second infant died because of ARDS, pulmonary interstitial emphysema and hypoxemic hypoxia.

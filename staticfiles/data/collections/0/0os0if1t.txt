Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for advanced stage gastric cancer (GC) patients, and developing chemoresistance is a tremendous challenge to efficacy of GC treatment. The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents recruit more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF1&#945;) in GC cells is activated upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and results in much more accumulation of M2-type TAMs which protect tumor cells from chemo-agents. Mechanistically, in the GC cells under the 5-FU treatment, reactive oxygen species is accumulated and then induces the activation of HIF1&#945; signaling to drive the expression of high-mobility group box 1, which leads to more macrophage's infiltration into GC tumor. In turn, the recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype and promote the chemoresistance of GC cells via producing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) to exacerbate the fatty acid ÃŸ-oxidation in tumor cells. Blocking GDF15 using antibody or inhibiting FAO of tumor cells by etomoxir efficiently gave rise to the tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune microenvironment and provides new therapeutic targets for clinic treatments of gastric cancer.

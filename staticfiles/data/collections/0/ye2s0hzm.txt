Abstract BALB/c male mice were mated with either Swiss-Webster or MF1 females to produce first generation cross-bred offspring. Hybridoma cell lines, from the fusion of P3-NS1-Ag4/1 myeloma cells with spleen cells sensitised to the porcine coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis, were injected intraperitoneally into these mice to produce ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies. Mice of 11 weeks of age weighing between 26 and 34 g were used. The volume of ascites produced by mice injected with four of the five hybrid cell lines tested was greater in the cross-bred offspring than in the BALB/c parent. The fifth cell line gave comparable volumes in the MF1 cross-breed and BALB/c parent but a lesser volume in the Swiss-Webster cross-breed. The antibody titres of the ascites as determined by virus neutralisation, radioimmune and indirect immune fluorescence assays, did not differ significantly between mouse types. The ability to use all offspring from a litter of cross-bred mice, irrespective of sex, and the increased volume of ascitic fluid formed in each mouse, permits fewer animals to be used for the production of ascites in these strains, thereby offering considerable economic and ethical advantages over the use of BALB/c mice.

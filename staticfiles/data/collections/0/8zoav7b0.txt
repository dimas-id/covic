Abstract The aim of this study was to estimate the therapeutic potential of specific egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) on dermatophytosis caused by Trichophyton rubrum. The IgY was produced by immunizing hens with cell wall proteins of T. rubrum, extracted from eggs by PEG precipitation and then purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The cross-reactivity (CR) with other fungi, growth inhibition on T. rubrum in vitro and therapeutic effect on T. rubrum infection in BALB/C mice of the specific IgY were then evaluated. Anti- T. rubrum cell wall proteins IgY (anti-trCWP IgY) presented a certain degree of cross-reactivity with different fungi. In the in vitro and in vivo activity researches, Anti-trCWP IgY showed a significant dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect on T. rubrum in vitro and a significant dose-dependent therapeutic effect on T. rubrum infection in BALB/C mice.

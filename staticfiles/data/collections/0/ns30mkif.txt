The human race is under the COVID-19 pandemic menace since beginning of the year 2020. Even though the disease is easily transmissible, a massive fraction of the affected people are recovering. Most of the recovered patients will not experience death due to COVID-19, even if they observed for a long period. They can be treated as long term survivors (cured population) in the context of lifetime data analysis. In this article, we present some statistical methods to estimate the cure fraction of the COVID-19 patients in India. Proportional hazards mixture cure model is used to estimate the cure fraction and the effect of covariates gender and age on lifetime. The data available on website https://api.cvoid19india.org is used in this study. We can see that, the cure fraction of the COVID-19 patients in India is more than 90%, which is indeed an optimistic information.

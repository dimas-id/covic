Abstract As one of the most unfavorable factors in milling, chatter will lead to poor surface quality, low production efficiency and tool life reduction. Chatter detection, especially weak chatter detection, is an effective way to ensure stable cutting. In this work, the milling dynamic responses based weak chatter detection method is put forward using sparse dictionary. Based on the milling dynamic equations, chatter frequencies are calculated and verified, which are the bases for chatter detection. With the calculated chatter frequencies, the sparse dictionary matrix can be constructed and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted for chatter frequencies reconstruction. The proposed method can extract weak chatter frequencies accurately. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can be successful in weak chatter identification.

The use of Grid technologies allows us to make progress in the prediction accuracy of epidemiological patterns, epidemiological modeling, risk predictions of infectious diseases etc by combining the geo-information and molecular simulation analysis methods. In this paper, we mainly design the eMicrob, in particular, build up the e-Microbe miniGrid deployed in IRSA, CAS and IME, the Chinese PLA. The architecture is as follows: Firstly we review related grid applications that are motivating widespread interest in Grid concepts within the scientific and engineering communities. Secondly we talk about the key methodologies and strategies involved in the construction of eMicrob. In the third section, the system design of the eMicrob, in particular about the architecture of the eMicrob miniGrid is discussed. Finally, we draw some conclusion in the process of the building of eMicrob and make some discussion about the challenges. It has been proven that the methods based on the Grid technologies are revolutionary and high efficient through the experience of the establishment and deployment of the e-Microbe miniGrid.

In recent years, strains of infectious bronchitis virus belonging to the QX-like genotype have been causing huge economic losses in commercial chicken flocks in different countries in Europe. In order to expand the knowledge of the molecular features of these viruses, we have sequenced and characterized the complete genome of European QX-like IBV strain CK/SWE/0658946/10, which was isolated in 2010 in Sweden. The genome is 27664 nucleotides in length, comprising six genes and 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The ORF1a, spike and nucleocapsid genes were under strong positive selective pressure that resulted in genetic diversity in relation to classical IBV isolates. The full-length genome of the CK/SWE/0658946/10 strain has the highest nucleotide sequence identity (93.18%) to ITA/90254/2005 and the lowest nucleotide identity (89.10%) to strain CQ04-1. Phylogenetic analysis of partial S1 gene sequences of IBV strains showed that the European QX-like genotype comprises strains that have been predominantly circulating in this continent for the past decade.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) Global Rheumatology Alliance (C19‐GRA) was formed in March 2020 as a grassroots organization to coordinate the response of the international rheumatology community to the pandemic [1]. The C19‐GRA launched an international, secure, de‐identified physician registry of patients with rheumatic diseases infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) to provide insights into the management and treatment of COVID‐19 in this population.

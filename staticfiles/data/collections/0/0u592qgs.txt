BACKGROUND In attempting to overcome the challenges associated with arm contouring, arm liposuction has been an area of focus in recent years. In appropriately selected patients, circumferential liposuction is the procedure of choice. The objective of this study is to describe our experience with the four-position four-entry site circumferential arm liposuction technique. METHODS All consecutive circumferential liposuction procedures that took place at our ambulatory surgical facility from January 2015 to November 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The four-position four-entry site circumferential arm liposuction technique is described, and photographs as well as videos are presented. RESULTS A total of 35 patients underwent circumferential bilateral arm liposuction via the four-position four-entry site technique. All patients were female, and their average age was 43 years. The average BMI was 28.4 kg/m2, and the average follow-up was 481 days. The average volume of lipoaspirate was 1,514 ml per patient, and the average volume of aspirated fat was 1,052 ml per patient. There was no incident of infection, seroma, bleeding event or venous thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS For the right candidate, the four-entry site four-position circumferential arm liposuction is an efficient and reproducible technique, which produces predictable and pleasing results.

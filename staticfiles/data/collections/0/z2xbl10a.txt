The situation of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still severe at present. In order to better fight against the epidemic and give full play to the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, we explored the feasibility of acupuncture therapy in the intervention of COVID-19 through analyzing the relevant literature in both ancient and modern time. Additionally, we analyzed the intervention scheme of acupuncture for COVID-19 developed by China Association of Acupuncture and Moxibustion and supplemented the protocol of the intervention with auricular acupuncture. It was proposed that the advantages of acupuncture and moxibustion should be fully displayed while Chinese herbal medications have been applied in the treatment of COVID-19. During treatment, acupuncture physicians should be rationally allocated to a certain proportion so as to adequately utilize comprehensive therapeutic approaches and guarantee people's safety to the greatest extent. Eventually, the clinical therapeutic effect may be improved, the national resources be economized on and the COVID-19 epidemic be conquered early.

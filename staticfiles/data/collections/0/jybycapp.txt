Several studies have demonstrated the clinical and technical benefits of the laparoscopic surgery for complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis. Our retrospective study included 12 patient who underwent SILS appendectomy (SILS-A), 14 who received conventional laparoscopic surgery (VL-A), and 12 who received laparotomic appendectomy (OA); performed in all cases by the same surgeon (C.F.). The aim of this study was the comparison between this three different surgical techniques on same features: post operative leukocytosis, post operative pain, need abdominal drainage, esthetic viewpoint, incidence of complication, hospital stay. The results showed no significant differences between SILS-A and VLS-A, while an evident improvement shows versus O-A, even though not statistically significative. SILS was more effective in decreasing the risk of postoperative wound infection.

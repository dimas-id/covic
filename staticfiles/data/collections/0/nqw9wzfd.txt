Emerging viral diseases pose a unique risk to public health, and thus there is a need to develop therapies. A current focus of funding agencies, and hence research, is the development of broad-spectrum antivirals, and in particular, those targeting common cellular pathways. The scope of this article is to review screening strategies and recent advances in this area, with a particular emphasis on antivirals targeting the step of viral entry for emerging lipid-enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus and SARS-coronavirus.

BACKGROUND We report the initial experience of modified four-branched graft technique for proximal aorta and arch repair, feasibly combined with antegrade thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to extend distal aortic reconstruction in acute type A aortic dissection. METHODS From 2011 to 2013, 12 consecutive patients with acute type A aortic dissection were indicated for arch surgery and underwent surgical replacement of proximal aorta, arch replacement or debranching procedure, and concomitant TEVAR for distal aortic repair. RESULTS A good surgical field was obtained in all patients. No major complications developed but two hospital deaths were attributed to end-organs damage preoperatively. Good and fast remodeling of thoracic descending aorta was demonstrated in 11 patients in postoperative CT imaging and no aneurysmal dilatation of visceral aorta had been observed in 10 patients during follow-up periods. CONCLUSION Modified four-branched graft technique facilitated proximal aorta and arch repair, and provided excellent neurological outcome and favorable short-term results. Single-stage operation combined with antegrade TEVAR is feasible and effective to extend the repair down to the descending aorta, and thus achieved good remodeling of thoracic descending aorta.

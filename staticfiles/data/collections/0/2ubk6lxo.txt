The communication highlights how the lack of basic resources, absence of a well‐functioning health system and the dearth of well‐coordinated communication channels, can bode ill for the successful fight against COVID‐19. The article elucidates COVID‐19 potential health, social, and economic implications for such countries. The communication cautions that if COVID‐19 is left to incubate and makes a home in weak systems, it will have a much better chance of mutating and coming back to infect many people globally. The communication calls on the international institutions in collaboration with developed nations to be prepared to probe up health systems in weak and conflict‐prone health systems with much‐needed resources in order to nip COVID‐19 in the bud.

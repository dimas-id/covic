BACKGROUND: Time, travel and financial constraints have meant that traditional visiting teaching engagements are more difficult to accomplish. This has been exacerbated with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) as an educational tool for distance teaching is underutilised and not fully exploited. This paper highlights the utility and feedback on the use of WSI for distance education/teaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Building on an existing relationship with the University of the West Indies (UWI), pathologists at University Health Network, Toronto, provided distance education using WSI, a digitised slide image hosting repository and videoconferencing facilities to provide case-based teaching to 15 UWI pathology trainees. Feedback was obtained from residents via a questionnaire and from teachers via a discussion. RESULTS: There was uniform support from teachers who felt that teaching was not hampered by the 'virtual' engagement. Comfort levels grew with each engagement and technical issues with sound diminished with the use of a portable speaker. The residents were very supportive and enthusiastic in embracing this mode of teaching. While technical glitches marred initial sessions, the process evened out especially when the slide hosting facility, teleconferencing and sound issues were changed. CONCLUSIONS: There was unanimous endorsement that use of WSI was the future, especially for distance teaching. However, it was not meant to supplant the use of glass slides in their current routine, daily practice.

Two geriatric (> 9 years old) dogs presented for vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia. Obstructive choledocholithiasis was diagnosed based on analysis of a serum biochemical analysis and abdominal radiographs and ultrasonography. In both dogs, choledocholiths were removed from the common bile duct via a choledochotomy without a cholecystectomy, and survival without recurrence occurred in both dogs for more than 1 year.

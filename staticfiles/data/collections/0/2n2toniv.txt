A competitive ELISA which differentiates between transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was used to detect non-neutralising antibodies to the peplomer protein of TGEV in porcine sera. The test was shown to be TGEV specific, having a relative specificity of 100 per cent, and to have a relative sensitivity of 94.9 per cent when compared with the virus neutralisation test. The prevalence of TGEV in Great Britain is low; only 0.6 per cent of sows sampled in 1990 were seropositive to TGEV. Seroconversion to the virus neutralisation test occurred in a closed herd in 1984, with no apparent spread, but later testing by the ELISA did not detect any blocking antibodies. The possibility of the existence of a less contagious strain of PRCV is discussed. All British isolates of TGEV tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test were recognised by the monoclonal antibody 1D.B12, the indicator antibody in the ELISA.

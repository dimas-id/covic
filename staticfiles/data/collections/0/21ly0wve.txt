The COVID-19 pandemic spread to almost all countries in the world within a few months, necessitating changes in medical care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as patients with various chronic diseases.

Psoriasis patients treated with immunosuppressive medications, including those under biologic therapy, are a special group.

PURPOSE New laparoscopic devices are being continuously developed to overcome some of the technical and ergonomic limitations of laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. This study aims to assess the surgeon's surgical performance and ergonomics during the use of a handheld, robotic-driven, articulating laparoscopic instrument during LESS surgery. METHODS Seven right-handed experienced surgeons took part in this study. A set of basic suturing tasks and digestive and urological procedures in a porcine model were performed. Surgeons used both a conventional laparoscopic needle holder and a robotic device. The learning curve, execution time, and precision using the surgical needle were assessed. The surgeon's posture was analyzed using a motion tracking system and a data glove. RESULTS After the training period, execution time on the intracorporeal suturing was significantly shorter using the conventional needle holder. The precision was higher using the conventional instrument in the horizontal plane, but the number of attempts to position the needle was lower using the robotic device (1.625 ± 0.250 vs 1.188 ± 0.375 attempts). The extension of the elbow (134.681 ± 14.35° vs 120.631 ± 13.134°) and the flexion of the shoulder (26.122 ± 7.411° vs 18.475 ± 14.166°) were significantly lower using the robotic instrument. The wrist posture using the robotic device was ergonomically acceptable during both surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS Results show a positive learning curve in ergonomics and surgical performance using the robotic instrument during LESS surgery. This instrument improves the surgeon's body posture and the needle positioning errors. The use of the robotic instrument is feasible and safe during LESS partial nephrectomy and sigmoidectomy procedures.

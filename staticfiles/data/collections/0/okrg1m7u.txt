Blue Water Resolute (BWR) Innovations in North Dakota, USA has developed a line of small, mobile fuel cell generator sanitation systems, featuring a 10 kW electrical generator on a movable cart. The SFC 110 Fuel Cell Thermal Sanitizer combines heat produced by a fuel cell with ultraviolet light to inactivate a full spectrum of biological contaminants – including viruses, bacteria and fungi – while providing uniform sanitisation coverage with minimal risk of material compatibility issues.

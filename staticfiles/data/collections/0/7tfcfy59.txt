Abstract Although a wide range of diseases have been reported in captive snow leopards, little is known about those affecting the species in the wild. However, the potential threat from diseases to wild snow leopards must not be underestimated as a consequence of lack of health surveillance throughout the inaccessible terrains they occupy. As a felid, the snow leopard is likely to be susceptible to most infectious agents affecting the domestic cat, and here we provide an overview of those with a risk of lethality for free-ranging snow leopards. In contrast to the health of snow leopards themselves, a great deal is known about the diseases affecting their primary prey species. We present these cases and highlight the importance of livestock as the main source of disease spillover to natural prey species. Further studies are required to understand the impact of infectious agents on intra- and interspecific population dynamics of snow leopards and associated prey.

INTRODUCTION Situs inversus totalis (mirror image organs) is a rare condition and may affect the intra-abdominal viscera as well as the intrathoracic organs. Cholelithiasis is not more common in these conditions, but the diagnosis may be more difficult. CASE PRESENTATION We present the case of a 59-year-old African woman with gallstones and situs inversus totalis. A single-port cholecystectomy was performed using a single trocar access device (SITRACC). CONCLUSIONS The procedure was uneventful, showing that this approach may be an option for this kind of surgery even in patients with situs inversus totalis.

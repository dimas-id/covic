In December 2019, a COVID-19 epidemic was discovered in Wuhan, China, and since has disseminated around the world impacting human health for millions. Herein, in-silico drug discovery approaches have been utilized to identify potential natural products (NPs) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. The MolPort database that contains over 100,000 NPs was screened and filtered using molecular docking techniques. Based on calculated docking scores, the top 5,000 NPs/natural-like products (NLPs) were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations. Combined 50 ns MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations revealed nine potent NLPs with binding affinities (&#916;Gbinding ) > -48.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, among the identified NLPs, four bis([1,3]dioxolo)pyran-5-carboxamide derivatives showed &#916;Gbinding > -56.0 kcal/mol, forming essential short hydrogen bonds with HIS163 and GLY143 amino acids via dioxolane oxygen atoms. Structural and energetic analyses over 50 ns MD simulation demonstrated NLP-Mpro complex stability. Drug-likeness predictions revealed the prospects of the identified NLPs as potential drug candidates. The findings are expected to provide a novel contribution to the field of COVID-19 drug discovery. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Recorded history continuously documents the invasion of populations by infectious agents, some causing many deaths before disappearing, others reappearing in invasions some years later in populations that have acquired some degree of immunity, due to prior exposure to related infectious pathogens. The “Spanish” flu epidemic of 1918–1919 exemplifies the devastating impact of relatively rare pandemics; this one was responsible for about 50,000,000 deaths worldwide, while on the mild side of the spectrum we experience annual influenza seasonal epidemics that cause roughly 35,000 deaths in the USA each year.

The repair of complex abdominal wall defects in contaminated fields often presents a dilemma for general surgeons. Synthetic mesh, although strong, may lead to chronic infection or even visceral erosion. Leaving the abdomen open presents challenges for ward management and delays definitive care, as well as allowing the musculature to retract over time. Numerous biological mesh alternatives have arisen over the previous decade, which may make primary closure in this setting a practical alternative, although durability may prove the downside. Here we present our local experience with PermacolTM mesh (Porcine Acellular Dermal Matrix - PADM; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) in four challenging cases and discuss the role this relatively new mesh may have for these and other applications.

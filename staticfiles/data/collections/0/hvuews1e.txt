OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the change of various indexes in patients with different types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). METHODS: 75 COVID‐19 patients were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and they were classified into moderate, severe and critically severe types according to the disease severity. The basic information, blood routine, pneumonia‐related blood indexes, immune‐related indexes along with liver, kidney and myocardial indexes in patients with different types were analyzed. RESULTS: The analysis of immune‐related indexes showed that the proportions of critically severe patients with abnormal IL‐2 and IL‐4 were higher than those of severe and moderate patients. In addition, the proportion of patients with abnormal total cholesterol increased as the severity of disease increased, and the proportion in critically severe patients was significantly higher than that in moderate patients. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with a more severe COVID‐19 are older and more likely to have a history of hypertension. With the progression of COVID‐19, the abnormal proportion of total white blood cell, neutrophils, lymphocytes, IL‐2, IL‐4 and total cholesterol increased. The change of these indexes in patients with different COVID‐19 types could provide reference for the disease severity identification and diagnosis of COVID‐19. In addition, the change in the total cholesterol level suggested that COVID‐19 would induce some liver function damage in patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

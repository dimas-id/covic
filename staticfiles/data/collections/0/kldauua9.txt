We describe a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) whose clinical symptoms were masked by Escherichia coli bacteremia. SARS developed in a cluster of healthcare workers who had contact with this patient. SARS was diagnosed when a chest infiltrate developed and when the patientâ€™s brother was hospitalized with acute respiratory failure. We highlight problems in atypical cases and offer infection control suggestions.

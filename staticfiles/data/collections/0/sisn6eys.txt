Formal concept analysis has been largely applied to explore taxonomic relationships and derive ontologies from text collections. Despite its recognized relevance, it generally misses relevant concept associations and suffers from the need to learn from Boolean space models. Biclustering, the discovery of coherent concept associations (subsets of documents correlated on subsets of terms and topics), is here suggested to address the aforementioned problems. This work proposes a structured view on why, when and how to apply biclustering for concept analysis, a subject remaining largely unexplored up to date. Gathered results from a large text collection confirm the relevance of biclustering to find less-trivial, yet actionable and statistically significant concept associations.

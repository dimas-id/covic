Traumatic temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) is a common disease and disorder of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ); however, its pathogenesis has yet to be completely elucidated. In the authors' previous studies, the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) was confirmed to exert a function in distraction osteogenesis (DO) during the healing of a condylar fracture, which resulted in the formation of excess bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in the expression of any associated genes via an Affymetrix GeneChip method. The traumatic TMJA model was fabricated by a condylar fracture in the TMJ area of sheep with either a dissected LPM (LPD) or normal (LPN). The untreated sheep served as a control. At 4- and 12 weeks post-surgery, the condylar zone was isolated to perform the gene chip analysis, which was performed according to a standard Affymetrix protocol. The validated genes were further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The gene chip analysis indicated that the LPN gene expression pattern was similar compared with the DO process, while LPD was similar to that of normal bone fracture healing. The validated genes were collagen type II α1 chain, C-type lectin domain family 3 member A, interleukin 1A, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, chondromodulin (LECT1), calcitonin receptor (CALCR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), bone γ-carboxyglutamate protein and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)7, among which, BMP7, LECT1, CALCR and FOS were confirmed by RT-qPCR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that LPM exerts a DO effect during the pathogenesis of traumatic TMJA, which may provide a novel target for preventing TMJA.

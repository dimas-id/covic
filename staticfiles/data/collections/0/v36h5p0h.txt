We hereby report a case of a 55-year-old male with fever and difficulty breathing over several days who treated for presumed COVID-19 pneumonia despite testing negative thrice via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasal swab. We explore several possible reasons for serially negative SARS-CoV-2 testing and other potential avenues of diagnosis.

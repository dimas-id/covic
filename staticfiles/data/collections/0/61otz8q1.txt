BACKGROUND The laparoscopic approach is increasingly adopted for liver resections today especially for lesions located in the left lateral liver section. This study was conducted to determine the impact of the introduction of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) as a surgical option for suspected small- to medium-sized (<8 cm) tumors located in the left lateral section (LLS). METHODS This is a retrospective review of 156 consecutive patients who underwent LLR or open liver resection (OLR) of tumors located in the LLS. The study was divided into 2 consecutive periods (period 1, January 2003 through September 2006, and period 2, October 2006 through April 2014); LLR was available as a surgical option only in the latter period. Comparisons made were LLR versus OLR, LLR versus OLR (in period 2 only), and resections performed in period 1 versus period 2. RESULTS Forty-two patients underwent LLR with 4 conversions. LLR was significantly associated with a longer median operative time [167.5 minutes (range, 60-525) vs 105 minutes (range, 40-235); P < .001], decreased need for the Pringle maneuver [n = 1 (2%) vs 22 (19%); P = .008], and shorter postoperative stay [n = 4 (range, 1-10) days vs 5 days (range, 2-47); P < .001] compared with open resection. Comparison of the 42 patients who underwent LLR with the 64 contemporaneous patients who underwent OLR demonstrated similar outcomes. Again, LLR was associated with a significantly longer operation, decreased need for the Pringle maneuver, and shorter hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS LLR can be safely adopted to treat lesions in the LLS. The procedure is associated with a shorter postoperative stay and a decreased need for the Pringle maneuver, but longer operative time compared with that required for OLR.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. COVID-19 affected close to 6million persons worldwide in fewer than 4 months, after the report of the first cases in China in December 2019. The relation of the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 to immunosuppressive treatment used in different gastrointestinal disorders is uncertain, resulting in debate with regard to suspending immunosuppressive therapy to improve infection outcome. Said suspension implies the inherent risk for graft rejection or autoimmune disease exacerbation that can potentially worsen the course of the infection. Based on the presently available evidence, a treatment stance has been established for patients with gastrointestinal diseases that require immunosuppressive therapy.

Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was used to produce cDNA clones. Part of a new clone and a previously reported clone were sequenced and used to construct the viral gene for integral membrane protein. A single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 262 amino acids, relative molecular mass (M(r)) 29459, was identified. The positive identification of the polypeptide as the integral membrane protein was demonstrated by the production in E. coli of a chimaeric protein comprising most of the ORF encoding the M(r) 29459 polypeptide and β‐galactosidase. The chimaeric protein reacted with a specific monoclonal antibody to viral integral membrane protein and antibodies raised against the chimaeric protein immune precipitated the viral protein. Comparison with the sequence of an avirulent isolate indicates amino acid residues that may be important in pathogenicity.

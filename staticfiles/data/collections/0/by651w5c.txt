SIMPLE SUMMARY: Commercial in vitro embryo production in horses by ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) is currently used to produce embryos clinically. However, the successful pregnancy and foaling rates obtained after ICSI are only 10% of the oocytes matured in vitro. Conditions used for oocyte in vitro maturation are not optimized for equine oocytes. Hence, in the present work, we aimed to elucidate the major metabolites present in equine preovulatory follicular fluid obtained from postmortem mares using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). Twenty-two metabolites were identified; among these, nine of them are not included in the composition of in vitro maturation media. Hence, our data suggest that the currently used media for equine oocyte maturation can be further improved. ABSTRACT: Production of equine embryos in vitro is currently a commercial technique and a reliable way of obtaining offspring. In order to produce those embryos, immature oocytes are retrieved from postmortem ovaries or live mares by ovum pick-up (OPU), matured in vitro (IVM), fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and cultured until day 8–10 of development. However, at best, roughly 10% of the oocytes matured in vitro and followed by ICSI end up in successful pregnancy and foaling, and this could be due to suboptimal IVM conditions. Hence, in the present work, we aimed to elucidate the major metabolites present in equine preovulatory follicular fluid (FF) obtained from postmortem mares using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR). The results were contrasted against the composition of the most commonly used media for equine oocyte IVM: tissue culture medium 199 (TCM-199) and Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium/nutrient mixture F-12 Ham (DMEM/F-12). Twenty-two metabolites were identified in equine FF; among these, nine of them are not included in the composition of DMEM/F-12 or TCM-199 media, including (mean ± SEM): acetylcarnitine (0.37 ± 0.2 mM), carnitine (0.09 ± 0.01 mM), citrate (0.4 ± 0.04 mM), creatine (0.36 ± 0.14 mM), creatine phosphate (0.36 ± 0.05 mM), fumarate (0.05 ± 0.007 mM), glucose-1-phosphate (6.9 ± 0.4 mM), histamine (0.25 ± 0.01 mM), or lactate (27.3 ± 2.2 mM). Besides, the mean concentration of core metabolites such as glucose varied (4.3 mM in FF vs. 5.55 mM in TCM-199 vs. 17.5 mM in DMEM/F-12). Hence, our data suggest that the currently used media for equine oocyte IVM can be further improved.

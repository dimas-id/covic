INTRODUCTION: We describe postmortem pulmonary histopathologic findings of COVID‐19 pneumonia in patients with a spectrum of disease course, from rapid demise to prolonged hospitalization. METHODS: Histopathologic findings in postmortem lung tissue from eight patients who died from COVID‐19 pneumonia were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect virus. RESULTS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in all cases with a spectrum of acute phase and/or organizing phase. IHC with monoclonal antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 viral nucleoprotein and spike protein detected virus in areas of acute but not organizing DAD, with intracellular viral antigen and RNA expression seen predominantly in patients with duration of illness less than 10 days. Major vascular findings included thrombi in medium and large caliber vessels, platelet microthrombi detected by CD61 IHC, and fibrin microthrombi. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA by NGS early in the disease course and expression of viral antigen by IHC exclusively in the acute but not in the organizing phase of DAD, suggests that the virus may play a major role in initiating the acute lung injury of DAD, but when DAD progresses to the organizing phase, the virus may have been cleared from the lung by the patient’s immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of a major change during the disease course of COVID‐19 pneumonia that may have therapeutic implications. Frequent thrombi and microthrombi may also present potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

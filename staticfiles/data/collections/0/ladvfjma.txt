Abstract This chapter contains the extended abstracts of the second conference on in situ and correlative electron microscopy (CISCEM 2014), held October 14–15, 2014, in Saarbrücken, Germany. The conference was housed at the INM-Leibniz Institute for New Materials. The aim of the conference was to bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists from the fields of biology, materials science, chemistry, and physics to discuss future directions of electron microscopy research. The topics of the different sessions were correlative and in situ electron microscopy in biology, in situ observations of biomineralization processes, designing in situ experiments, high-temperature and other experiments, and in situ transmission electron microscopy of catalytic nanoparticles. A corporate session was also held.

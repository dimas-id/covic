To write this book I inhabited design cultures in the music industries and followed the flows and connections and moved within these industries as a curious traveller. In doing so, I have attempted to provide a more extended and embedded understanding of the music industries. This chapter therefore outlines the research methods used, including the method of participant observation. I used this method to immerse myself in the production of music videos, album art, gig posters and stage designs by Jefferton James. This chapter also outlines the selection of participants for the semi-structured interviews that were conducted and the rationale for the case studies, as well as the visual method and the digital ethnographic and sensory ethnographic methods that were used.

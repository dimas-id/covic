Viral infections remain important causes of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. More recent developments in preparative regimens and graft manipulations, as well as the control of well‐recognized post‐transplant infections by the introduction of prophylaxis and preemptive strategies, have influenced the timing and the epidemiology of infections. As new pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus, human coronaviruses HCoV‐NL63 and HCoV‐HKU1, human herpesviruses HHV‐6 and HHV‐7, and polyomaviruses, have emerged, it is fundamental to determine the significance of the newly discovered viruses and their role in the transplantation field. This article summarizes recent data on epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis of new pathogens, as well as clinical features and management of the associated infectious complications. J. Med.

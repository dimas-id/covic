The growth rates of COVID-19 across different geographical regions (e.g., states in a nation, countries in a continent) follow different shapes and patterns. The overall summaries at coarser spatial scales that are obtained by simply averaging individual curves (across regions) obscure nuanced variability and blurs the spatial heterogeneity at finer spatial scales. We employ statistical methods to analyze shapes of local COVID-19 growth rate curves and statistically group them into distinct clusters, according to their shapes. Using this information, we derive the so-called elastic averages of curves within these clusters, which correspond to the dominant incidence patterns. We apply this methodology to the analysis of the daily incidence trajectory of the COVID-pandemic at two spatial scales: A state-level analysis within the USA and a country-level analysis within Europe during mid-February to mid-May, 2020. Our analyses reveal a few dominant incidence trajectories that characterize transmission dynamics across states in the USA and across countries in Europe. This approach results in broad classifications of spatial areas into different trajectories and adds to the methodological toolkit for guiding public health decision making at different spatial scales.

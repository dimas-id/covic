BACKGROUND Outbreaks of infectious diseases and / or colonization pose an increasing burden on hospitals and the health system in general and can be a threat to patient safety. METHODS At the end of 2013 we implemented a quality assurance registry of outbreak investigations performed by the Deutsches Beratungszentrum f√ºr Hygiene (German Consulting Center for Infection Control and prevention) in Freiburg. Now we analyzed the registered outbreaks until January 2015. RESULTS Norovirus was the leading causative organism and gram negative bacteria dominated the group of bacterial outbreaks. Outbreaks lasted between 6 and 185 days. 24 % of outbreaks were related to colonization only. Within 29 outbreaks we had 187 infected patients, 50 colonized patients und 92 infected health care workers (64 x norovirus, 20 x influenza, 8 x scabies). No deaths were recorded. Several risk factors and improvement potentials for future outbreaks could be identified. CONCLUSION Lack of staff compliance with vaccination or prophylactic therapy, misuse of personal protective equipment and lapses in absence from work for the required time can play an important role for prolonged outbreak situations esp. with viral outbreaks and scabies. A structured and goal directed outbreak management especially in the initial phase of an outbreak seems to be important for an efficient and fast termination of an outbreak.

Human Parainfluenzaviruses (PIVs) account for a significant proportion of viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in children, and are also associated with morbidity and mortality in adults, including nosocomial infections. This work aims to describe PIV genotypes and their clinical and epidemiological distribution. Between December 2016 and December 2017, 6121 samples were collected, and submitted to viral culture and genomic quantification, specifically Parainfluenza 1–4 (PIV1–4), Influenza A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) A and B, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, and Enterovirus. Normalized viral load, as (log10) copies/10(3) cells, was calculated as virus Ct, determined by multiple qRT-PCR, as a function of the Ct of β-globin. PIV was confirmed in 268 cases (4.37%), and linked to both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, being more frequent in children than in adults (5.23 and 2.43%, respectively). PIV1 and PIV3 were most common (31 and 32.5%, of total PIV positive samples, respectively), with distribution being similar in children and adults, as was viral load. PIV type was correlated with seasonality: PIV3 being more frequent in winter and spring, PIV1 in summer, and PIV 4 in fall. No correlation between vial load and clinical severity was found. Novel findings were that PIV viral load was higher in fall than in other seasons, and PIV4, classically linked to mild respiratory symptoms, was circulating, in children and adults, at all levels of symptoms throughout the year.

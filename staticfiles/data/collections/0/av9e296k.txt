Big data has gained academic relevance over the last decade and is also of interest to other role-players such as governments, businesses and the general public. Based on our previous work on the Big Data Readiness Index (BDRI) we place the focus on one under-investigated aspect of big data: the linkage to happiness. The BDRI, applied on Africa, includes the topic of happiness within the digital wellbeing driver, but the link between the two topics requires further investigation. Thus, two underlying questions emerge: what is the relation between happiness and big data? And how does Africa perform in digital wellbeing? This paper includes a structured literature review highlighting five key clusters indicating this link. Furthermore, we present some first empirical insights using the BDRI focusing on Africa. Overall, the African continent performs best in the social inclusion cluster of happiness, with the most room for improvement in the job creation cluster.

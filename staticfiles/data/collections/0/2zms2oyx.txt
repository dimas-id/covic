Cell-to-cell spread of retroviruses via virological synapse (VS) contributes to overall progression of disease. VS are specialized pathogen-induced cellular structures that facilitate cell-to-cell transfer of HIV-1 and HTLV-1. VS provide a mechanistic explanation for cell-associated retroviral replication. While VS share some common features with neurological or immunological synapses, they also exhibit important differences. The role of VS might not be limited to human retroviruses and the emerging role of a plant synapse suggests that VS might well be conserved structures for cell-cell spreading of both animal and plant viruses. Dissection of the VS is just at its beginning, but already offers ample information and fascinating insights into mechanisms of viral replication and cell-to-cell communication.

This chapter describes a variety of pathogens found in the environment that are capable of infecting humans and causing disease. Different classes of pathogens are discussed including bacteria, parasites and viruses. For each pathogen, data are provided on the incidence of the organism in a particular environmental matrix such as water, food or municipal waste. In addition, we discuss: the disease caused by the particular microbe; the mode of transmission; the incubation time needed within the host prior to the onset of disease; and the duration of illness. Fate and transport of pathogens in the environment are also described. A variety of bacterial pathogens are discussed including waterborne and waterbased bacteria. Parasites discussed include protozoa, nematodes, cestodes and trematodes. For viruses, both enteric and respiratory viruses are included.

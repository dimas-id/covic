About twenty years ago, a new coronavirus, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), was detected in swine herds. This virus is related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); however, it is not enteropathogenic but causes only minor respiratory symptoms. As PRCoV shares some epitopes for neutralizing antibodies with TGEV, it acts like a nature-made vaccine against TGEV resulting in a drastic reduction of TGE outbreaks in Europe. A major difference between the two porcine coronaviruses is a large deletion in the surface protein S gene of PRCoV. Because of this structural difference, TGEV but not PRCoV has a sialic acid binding activity that allows the attachment to mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins. The sialic acid binding activity may allow TGEV to overcome the mucus barrier in the gut and to get access to the intestinal epithelium for initiation of infection.

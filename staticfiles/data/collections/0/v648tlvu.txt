Practical relevance: Ciclosporin (CsA) is a systemic immuno-modulatory drug widely used to treat immune-mediated diseases in humans and veterinary species. CsA was registered for use in cats in the USA and Europe in 2011, and is indicated for the treatment of chronic allergic dermatitis at a recommended daily dose of 7 mg/kg PO. AUDIENCE This review will be of interest to all veterinarians working with cats, given the wide range of potential applications of CsA and its safety profile. Although the drug is currently only licensed to treat chronic allergic dermatitis in cats, a small number of reports describe its use in non-dermatological conditions. Evidence base: This article reviews the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, adverse effects and clinical use of CsA, both for the licensed indication and for off-label use in the feline patient. Information presented has been summarised from the existing literature on CsA, with specific interest in studies carried out in cats. For its licensed indication, chronic allergic dermatitis, evidence provided includes randomised, placebo or prednisolone-controlled studies (EBM grade I) and prospective or retrospective open trials.

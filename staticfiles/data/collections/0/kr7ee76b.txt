Canine influenza virus (CIV) is a newly identified, highly contagious respiratory pathogen of dogs. The clinical disease has high morbidity and low mortality. Diagnosis of canine influenza is based on acute and convalescent serum samples, history, and clinical signs. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the etiologic agent is an influenza A virus that is closely related to the equine influenza A (H3N8) virus. Data collected thus far support transmission from horses to dogs with horizontal spread in the canine population. This interspecies jump and the close companionship of dogs and people warrant close monitoring of CIV for potential transmission to humans.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is an acute respiratory illness caused by SARS coronavirus. This virus was possibly transmitted from an animal reservoir to humans, and from February 2003, the epidemic was spread internationally by further person-to-person transmission. The SARS epidemic was managed by well-known principles of infection control, including prompt diagnosis, isolation of patients, and quarantine of contacts. The successful control of the outbreak is a remarkable international achievement, though much about SARS remains poorly understood.

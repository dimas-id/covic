A&E sister Vicky Hamer was among emergency staff at Hope Hospital, Salford, who featured in a BBC One fly-onthe-wall documentary series, Trauma, this summer. Over the four weeks' filming staff came close to having to divert ambulances due to capacity problems and had to manage several suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Ms Hamer said: 'It made us realise how well we worked together and it was good to reflect on that.'

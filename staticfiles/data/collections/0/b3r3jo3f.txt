Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who receive hemodialysis have high rates of psychosocial distress and nonadherence to diet prescription. The purpose of this study was to examine the quantitative research evidence about the effect of depressive symptoms on dietary adherence. A systematic search of the literature using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases was performed for quantitative research studies. Forty-four studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Nearly all studies supported an association between depressive symptoms and dietary adherence in patients with ESRD. Depressive symptoms were associated with dietary nonadherence in patients with ESRD.

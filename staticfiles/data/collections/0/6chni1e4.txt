Alphaviruses, including Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), are among the leading causes of recurrent epidemics all over the world. Alphaviral nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) orchestrates the capping of nascent viral RNA via its S‐adenosyl methionine‐dependent N‐7‐methyltransferase (MTase) and guanylyltransferase activities. Here, we developed and validated a novel capillary electrophoresis (CE)‐based assay for measuring the MTase activity of purified VEEV and CHIKV nsP1. We employed the assay to assess the MTase inhibition efficiency of a few adenosine analogs and identified 5‐iodotubercidin (5‐IT) as an inhibitor of nsP1. The antiviral potency of 5‐IT was evaluated in vitro using a combination of cell‐based assays, which suggest that 5‐IT is efficacious against CHIKV in cell culture (EC(50): 0.409 µm).

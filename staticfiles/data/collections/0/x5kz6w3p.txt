Septoplasty is a common procedure in ENT practice with fewer complication rates. Long term follow-up is usually not necessary. The aim of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of virtual telephonic consultation to follow-up the patients in the immediate postoperative period. After excluding the patients based on the criteria, twenty-four patients were telephonically followed up by a resident using structured NOSE questionnaires and the responses were noted. All the patients had improvement in symptoms with 14 patients completely asymptomatic (NOSE score of < 5). Two patients had moderate symptoms (NOSE score 30–50) and 8 patients had mild symptoms (nose score 5–25). Majority of the patients interviewed were satisfied with the telephonic follow up and were willing to accept such patient-friendly services in the future. Virtual Telephonic follow-up of patient undergone uncomplicated septoplasty is a feasible, cost-effective model with a high rate of patient satisfaction.

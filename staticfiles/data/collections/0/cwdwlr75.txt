The physical and social isolation measures associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, although certainly necessary to contain the spread of the virus, represent a particularly distressing aspect that might accentuate the fears and pain associated with the disease, especially for patients, their family members, and health-care professionals. Affiliative responses to the crises are emerging as ad hoc or formally endorsed practices within COVID-19 facilities in Italy, aimed at establishing links of communication between patients and family members by using new communication technologies. Tending to the emotional needs of patients and mending the affiliative connections interrupted by the disease are good examples of interdisciplinary cohesion and affiliative responses to the COVID-19 emergency.

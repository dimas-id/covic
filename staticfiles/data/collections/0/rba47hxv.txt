The disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has many systemic manifestations affecting the upper airways, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and inducing hematological repercussions. With the evolution of the pandemic, skin lesions were observed. However, there is little information about the evolution of the lesions at this moment. The authors report a case of a patient who had more than one exposure to the coronavirus during the evolution of the disease and manifested different types of edematous lesions. The lesions started in the prodromal period and changed their presentation and localization during the evolution of COVID-19. The lesions regressed quickly with the use of corticoid cream and antihistamine. Viral skin lesions are frequent causes of exanthema. However, viral etiology is not always investigated in acute urticarial and atypical erythematous-edematous conditions. The immunological basis of acute urticaria has points in common with COVID-19, justifying the appearance of lesions. Investigation of viral etiology should always be remembered in acute urticarial and edematous conditions.

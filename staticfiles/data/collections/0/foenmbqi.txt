Proteases are enzymes that have the capacity to hydrolyze peptide bonds and degrade other proteins. Proteases can promote inflammation by regulating expression and activity of different pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other immune components in the lung compartment. They are categorized in three major subcategories: serine proteases, metalloproteases and cysteine proteases especially in case of lung diseases. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases (NSPs), metalloproteases and some mast cell-derived proteases are mainly focused here. Their modes of actions are different in different diseases for e.g. NE induces the release of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells through a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF-6-dependent pathway and also through EGFR MAPK pathway. NSPs contribute to immune regulation during inflammation through the cleavage and activation of specific cellular receptors. MMPs can also influence the progression of various inflammatory processes and there are many non-matrix substrates for MMPs, such as chemokines, growth factors and receptors. During lung inflammation interplay between NE and MMP is an important significant phenomenon. They have been evaluated as therapeutic targets in several inflammatory lung diseases. Here we review the role of proteases in various lung inflammatory diseases with emphasis on their mode of action and contribution to immune regulation during inflammation.

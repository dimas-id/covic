BACKGROUND Chronic pancreatitis can be relentless, resulting in debilitating pain and endocrine and exocrine insufficiency. Medical interventions are used initially but when these fail, surgical therapy is often indicated. Surgical options include resection, drainage, and hybrid procedures. Hybrid procedures, such as the Frey procedure are associated with improved outcomes in select patients. These advantages are even greater when the Frey is performed laparoscopically. METHODS A patient with chronic pancreatitis was referred to our clinic. Preoperative imaging revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct with multiple large pancreatic duct stones. She subsequently underwent a laparoscopic Frey procedure. RESULTS The patient did very well with no pancreatic leak, wound infection, or delayed gastric emptying. She was discharged home on postoperative day 6, symptom free with no narcotic requirement. CONCLUSIONS For patients in whom the laparoscopic Frey procedure is possible, it can be used to treat chronic pancreatitis with the benefits of a minimally invasive approach.

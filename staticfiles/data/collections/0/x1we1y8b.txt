Robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) has emerged as a safe and effective treatment option for symptomatic patients with lower urinary tract symptoms related to significant benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) above 80 g. The recent release of the da Vinci SP robotic system (Intuitive, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) continues to advance the minimally invasive nature of robotic surgical technology. We now report our institution's initial experience performing RASP using the da Vinci SP robotic system. An IRB-approved, retrospective chart review was performed of all patients undergoing robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy using the da Vinci SP surgical system in the treatment of benign prostatic enlargement by a single surgeon from March to June 2019. Pre-operative, intraoperative, and post-operative data were collected for descriptive analysis. A total of 10 men, mean age of 69 ± 4 years, with mean prostate volume of 104 ± 11 g underwent surgery. The robotic cannula and a single assistant port were utilized in all cases. No cases required conversion to a multi-port robotic platform or open approach, nor required the placement of additional assistant ports. No intraoperative or immediate post-operative complications were noted. Mean estimated blood loss was 141 ± 98 mL and operative time was 172 ± 19 min. Mean catheter time was 1.9 ± 1.8 days. One patient reported transient de novo stress urinary incontinence. Single-port RASP is a safe and effective intervention for BPE. The smaller surgical footprint from the device appears to make earlier catheter removal possible. Comparative evaluation with multi-port RASP and other modalities is warranted.

The diffusion of minimally invasive techniques for renal surgery has prompted a renewed interest in nephropexy which is indicated to prevent nephroptosis in symptomatic patients and to mobilize the upper ureter downward in order to bridge a ureteral defect. Recent publications have been reviewed to present the state of the art of the diagnosis and management of these two challenging conditions and to try to foresee the next steps. The evaluation of patients with mobile kidney can be made relying on diagnostic criteria such as ultrasound with color Doppler and measurement of resistive index, conventional upright X-ray frames after a supine uro-computerized tomography scan and both static and dynamic nuclear medicine scans, always with evaluation in the sitting or erect position. Laparoscopic nephropexy emerges as the current treatment option combining both objectively controlled repositioning of the kidney and resolution of symptoms with minimal invasiveness, low morbidity, and short hospital stay. The use of robotics is presently limited by its higher cost, but may increase in the future. Downward renal mobilization and nephropexy is a safe and versatile technique which has been adopted as a unique strategy or more often in combination with other surgical maneuvers in order to cope with complex ureteral reconstruction.

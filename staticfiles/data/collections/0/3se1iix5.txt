AIM To evaluate feasibility of surgical treatment for ectopic pregnancy with single laparoscopic access with SILS(®) system. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted an open study from 1/7/2009 to 1/12/2010 in a single gynaecologic department. All procedures were performed by three operators. Procedures evaluated were corneal resection, salpingotomy, salpingectomy. Feasibility, per- and postoperative data were reported. RESULTS We performed completely 31 over 32 (97%) surgical procedures with SILS(®) system (27 salpingectomies and five salpingotomies). In one case, conversion to conventional laparoscopy was required. No intra- or postoperative complications were reported. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery for ectopic pregnancy by single access seems feasible with SILS(®) system. Further study including larger number of patients and operators were necessary to confirm risks and advantages of this technique.

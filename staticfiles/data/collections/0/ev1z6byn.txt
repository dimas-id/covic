The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused Coronavirus Disease 2019, widely known as COVID-19, now a pandemic with extraordinary infectivity, mortality, and fomite adhesiveness. We delineate cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, some of which may represent adverse cutaneous drug reactions, and skin changes associated with COVID-19 lifestyle alterations in patients and health care workers. We review COVID-19 from both a dermatologic and public health perspective.

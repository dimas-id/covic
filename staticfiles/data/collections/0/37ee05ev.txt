The successful therapeutic synergism of aprotinin and rimantadine, which are known to attack different viral targets, was demonstrated in influenza‐virus infected animals. Combined treatment with these drugs of mice infected with a highly lethal does of mouse‐adapted influenza virus prevented the development of separate administration of aprotinin and rimantadine induced 35% and 15% protection, respectively.

The seven NIH‐sponsored Regional Primate Research Centers conduct a wide variety of studies in the neurosciences and on aging. Monkeys and chimpanzees are investigated to validate the results of research obtained with lower species. In addition, primates are often the only species with the appropriate characteristics for studying a particular health problem or certain behavioral or biological principles. One neurological disorder for which the primate model has proven crucial is Parkinson's disease. The surgical implantation of dopaminergic cells and tissue containing a growth factor has been developed in the primate model, and is now being evaluated clinically in humans with Parkinsonism. In addition to neurological diseases such as Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, the visual system is a strong focus of basic and applied research at the Centers. In 1981, two neuroscientists whose basic research on vision with application to pediatric ophthalmology took place in part at the New England Regional Primate Research Center, were honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Currently, vision studies at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, for example, focus on myopia, post‐surgical treatment of congenital cataracts, adult cataract development and treatment, and laser surgery to correct corneal abnormalities. At the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, the role of diet in visual impairment is evaluated during infancy. Diet is also studied to determine its role in the aging process, and the effects of aging on memory. Further, brain cells and other components of the nervous system in aging are also being investigated at these centers. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

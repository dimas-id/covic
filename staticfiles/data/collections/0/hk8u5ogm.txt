Significant advances have been made in the endovascular treatment of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. Since the 2011 update, technologies has developed and allowed for the revascularization of complex vascular lesions. Although this technical success is encouraging, these technologies must provide measurable long-term clinical success at a reasonable cost. Large, randomized, controlled trials need to be designed to focus on clinical outcomes and success rates for treatment. These future studies will serve as the guide by which clinicians can provide the most successful clinical and cost effect care in treating patients with lower-extremity peripheral artery disease.

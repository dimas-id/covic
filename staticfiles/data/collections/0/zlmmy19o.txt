A good focused history is essential to the adequate assessment of chest pain. It is important to rapidly exclude potentially life-threatening causes of chest pain to avoid adverse clinical outcomes.This should be preceded by an ABCD (airway, breathing, circulation, disability) assessment. Once cardiac chest pain is determined to be likely, early risk stratification should be achieved in order to guide choice of further management.

OBJECTIVE To study the variation of specific antibody among convalescent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients through a three-year program. METHODS Sera samples were collected from SARS cases in the 5th, 20th and 35th month after onset of the illness. The SARS-CoV specific antibody was detected for all of them by ELISA and neutralized test simultaneously. The titer of neutralizing antibodies was calculated using Reed-Muench method, and the comparison between different time groups was analyzed regarding the variance of data on repeated measures after logarithm conversion. RESULTS 13, 17 and 13 sera samples were collected in the 5th, 20th and 35th month after onset. Results showed that despite the fact that the positive rates of ELISA antibody were 100%, 82.4% and 84.6% respectively,the neutralizing antibody was still positive for all the samples. The average neutralizing antibody titers were 1:43 (1:16-1:203), 1:36 (1:17-1:59) and 1:21 (1:10-1:39) on the 5th, 20th and 35th month after onset, and the differences were statistically significant (F = 60.419, P < 0.001). On the 35th month after the onset, 30.8% (4/13) of the patients were still having the neutralizing antibody level of above 1:36, but the neutralizing antibody level in another 30.8% (4/13) of the patients had decreased to as low as 1:10, when the cut-off level was set as 1:8. CONCLUSION Results of the study indicated that the neutralizing antibody of SARS cases could last for at least three years, but the sera specific antibody in SARS cases decreased gradually when time went by. However, neutralizing antibody in some of the cases decreased to a lower level on the 35th month. Further follow-up study was worthwhile to observe the long-lasting profile of antibody existence on SARS cases.

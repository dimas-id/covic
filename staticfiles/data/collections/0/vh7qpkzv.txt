Abstract The elucidation of the antigenic structure of the envelope proteins of Arteriviridae which includes lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) will provide further understanding of a mechanism of strict host cell specificity. To analyze the linkage between LDV envelope proteins, M/VP-2 and VP-3, which may play an important role in viral infectivity, we generated specific antibody against M/VP-2 that has not been reported in previous studies. A synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of LDV strain C (LDV-C) ORF6, which encodes M/VP-2, was chemically synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). The peptide was immunogenic in rabbits and induced antibody specific for viral protein. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis of virion M/VP-2 in infected macrophages showed that the antibody was able to react specifically with authentic virion protein. The immunoreactive antibody against LDV M/VP-2 described in this study will be useful for further studies of the specific roles of the envelope proteins in arterivirus assembly and infectivity.

The COVID-19 pandemic affects the whole world. Spain is 5th in the world and 3rd in Europe with the largest number of diagnosed cases. Spanish citizens' attitudes are important in controlling the pandemic. This research assessed attitudes of Spaniards toward COVID-19 in two studies. One (n = 64) was conducted in a shopping centre in Madrid and another (n = 640) online. The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a 'more responsible' attitude toward the COVID-19 than men. Young adults (18-25 years) scored lower on compliance with safety measures and perceived need to stay home than older adults. In Study 1, level of compliance, knowing someone at risk, and knowing someone infected predicted 31.2% of the variance in the perceived need to stay home. In Study 2, personal concern, level of compliance, keeping distance from others, and perceived social alarm predicted 28.5% of the variance in perceived need to stay home. Regardless of age and/or gender, Spanish people's personal concern about COVID-19 was less than their perceived social alarm about it. These results might help policy makers in considering public attitudes which could play an important role in controlling the current, and possibly a second, wave of COVID-19.

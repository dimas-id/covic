The implications and management of fluid overload in pediatric critical care remain areas of ongoing controversy. Consensus definitions and methods of quantitating fluid overload continue to evolve, paralleling our growing understanding of fluid dynamics in critically ill patients. Fluid overload has been associated with adverse outcomes in some patient populations; guidelines for fluid management therapies are sparse and have little supporting data. Conflicting data for efficacy of therapies such as diuretic medications and renal replacement therapy are likely reflective of an incomplete understanding of the dynamic relationship between critical illness and fluid overload. Although some guidance regarding diuresis, continuous renal replacement therapy, and fluid balance goals is elucidated in the following chapters, it is important to recognize that further research into these management strategies is required before standardized approaches to management can be established.

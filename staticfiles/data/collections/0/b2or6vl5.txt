In treating non-stenting zones (NSZs), such as the common femoral artery (CFA) and popliteal artery (PA), the best method to treat severely calcified NSZ lesions remains controversial. Here we describe a new method for the treatment of severely calcified PA and CFA lesions using the CrosserÂ® system (CS). After the first wire passed the lesion, the CS was passed through the other wire to create new cracks and lumens (NCAL) in both cases. After creating NCAL around the lumen of the first wire, a large scoring balloon was inflated to crush the severe calcification like a "GLASS CUT" with a glass knife.

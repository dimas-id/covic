Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening a surging number of populations worldwide, including women in breastfeeding period. Limited evidence is available concerning breastfeeding in women with COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-three pregnant women and puerperae were enrolled in the study. To evaluate the effect of breastfeeding on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the presence of SARS-CoV-2, IgG and IgM in breast milk, maternal blood and infant blood were assessed. Feeding patterns were also recorded in follow-up. Results: No positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 of neonates was found. All breast milk samples were negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of IgM ofSARS-CoV-2 in breast milk was correlated with maternal blood. The results of IgG detection for SARS-CoV-2 were negative in all breast milk samples. All the infants were in healthy condition while six of them were fed with whole or partial breast milk. Eight infants received antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 in one month after birth and the results were all negative. Conclusion: Findings from this small number of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for mother-to-child transmission via breast feeding in women with COVID-19 in the third trimester and puerperium.

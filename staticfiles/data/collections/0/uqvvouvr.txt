Our objective was to establish the efficiency of single-incision laparoscopic Heller myotomy and Dor fundoplication (SILHD) as treatment for esophageal achalasia. A 58-year-old man underwent SILHD for achalasia. The left triangular ligament was retracted using a suture thread and fixed to the body surface, providing a good operative field at the cardia. We performed a 7-cm long myotomy, extending 2 cm into the gastric wall, using a tissue-sealing device or L-shaped electrocautery. Oral intake resumed on postoperative day 1, and hospital stay was 4 days. No morbidity was observed. Based on our experience, we believe that the SILHD can be performed safely and seems to offer at least short-term benefits for selected patients with esophageal achalasia, when performed by surgeons experienced in laparoscopic and esophageal surgery.

Rising concerns over respiratory illnesses caused by agents such as avian influenza viruses and SARS coronavirus have prompted intensive research efforts and the resurgence of nonhuman primates as models for these human diseases. In the context of studying influenza infection and vaccine development, serial bronchoscopic procedures, including bronchial brush biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage, were performed in pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The possible need for oxygen supplementation during these procedures was anticipated because of the size of the animals relative to the 5-mm bronchoscope. We therefore monitored oxyhemoglobin saturation, a measure of arterial blood oxygen content, before and after insertion of the bronchoscope, during bronchoalveolar lavage, and after initiation of oxygen supplementation. Although more data are required to draw definitive conclusions, our findings suggested the need for oxygen supplementation during such procedures in nonhuman primates, despite the fact that human patients undergoing bronchoscopy and lavage do not routinely get oxygen unless they are already compromised. Our data also suggested that the need for supplementation could not be predicted from simple parameters such as size of the animal, presence of respiratory clinical signs, or experimental treatment. Finally, we show a simple and cost-effective method of using human nasal cannulas for delivering oxygen to pigtailed macaques during bronchoscopic procedures, and we believe that, after further testing, this method could be used safely and effectively in other nonhuman primate species.

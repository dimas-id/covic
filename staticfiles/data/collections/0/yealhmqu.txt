Millions of people are being infected with COVID-19 around the globe. Though the majority of them will recover, cancer patients remain at a higher risk to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its related severe outcomes. Understanding how viruses contribute to human cancers provides us with new opportunities for preventing or treating virus-associated cancers. However, a limited amount of research has been done to date in the context of how viral infections impact cancer at the cellular level and vice versa. Therefore, in light of the COVID-19 global infection, this review highlights the need for better understanding of the biology of viral infections in cancer patients, to enable novel therapies to co-target viral infections and cancer.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Different imaging paradigms have been used to select patients for endovascular therapy in stroke. We sought to determine whether computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) selection improves endovascular therapy outcomes compared with noncontrast computed tomography alone. METHODS Review of a prospectively collected registry of anterior circulation stroke patients undergoing stent-retriever thrombectomy at a tertiary care center between September 2010 and March 2016. Patients undergoing CTP were compared with those with noncontrast computed tomography alone. The primary outcome was the shift in the 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS). RESULTS A total of 602 patients were included. CTP-selected patients (n=365, 61%) were younger (P=0.02) and had fewer comorbidities. CTP selection (n=365, 61%) was associated with a favorable 90-day mRS shift (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.09; P=0.02), higher rates of good outcomes (90-day mRS score 0-2: 52.9% versus 40.4%; P=0.005), modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction-3 reperfusion (54.8% versus 40.1%; P<0.001), smaller final infarct volumes (24.7 mL [9.8-63.1 mL] versus 34.6 mL [13.1-88 mL]; P=0.017), and lower mortality (16.6% versus 26.8%; P=0.005). When matched on age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, and glucose (n=424), CTP remained associated with a favorable 90-day mRS shift (P=0.016), lower mortality (P=0.02), and higher rates of reperfusion (P<0.001). CTP better predicted functional outcomes in patients presenting after 6 hours (as assessed by comparison of logistic regression models: Akaike information criterion: 199.35 versus 287.49 and Bayesian information criterion: 196.71 versus 283.27) and those with an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score â‰¤7 (Akaike information criterion: 216.69 versus 334.96 and Bayesian information criterion: 213.6 versus 329.94). CONCLUSIONS CTP selection is associated with a favorable mRS shift in patients undergoing stent-retriever thrombectomy. Future prospective studies are warranted.

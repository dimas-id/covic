In view of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 it deems essential to understand the key concepts about the infection: its epidemiological origin, presentation, clinical course, diagnosis and treatment (still experimental in many cases).

The present narrative review aims to summarize the most relevant aspects and synthetize concepts on COVID-19 for surgeons.

Obesity and its associated conditions, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, have reached epidemic proportions. Gastrointestinal weight loss surgery (GIWLS) shows the most promise in achieving significant and sustained weight loss and diabetes resolution. However, a large mismatch exists between the magnitude of the obesity epidemic and the number of surgical procedures performed to produce a significant shift in the distribution of obesity on a population level. This mismatch is fueled by high surgical costs, morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and the fact that the greatest public health burden of obesity comes from those around the center of the population body mass index distribution with mild to moderate obesity, rather than those at the distribution tail with severe obesity that GIWLS targets. New endoscopic methods, capitalizing on advances in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which GIWLS works, are developing to provide viable alternatives in the treatment of bariatric surgical complications, and for the primary treatment of obesity. These methods may have the added advantage of reduced invasiveness, reversibility, cost-effectiveness, and applicability to a larger segment of the population with moderate obesity.

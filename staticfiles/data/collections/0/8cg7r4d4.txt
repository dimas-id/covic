Folding of proteins is essential so that they can exert their functions. For proteins that transit the secretory pathway, folding occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and various chaperone systems assist in acquiring their correct folding/subunit formation. N-glycosylation is one of the most conserved posttranslational modification for proteins, and in eukaryotes it occurs in the ER. Consequently, eukaryotic cells have developed various systems that utilize N-glycans to dictate and assist protein folding, or if they consistently fail to fold properly, to destroy proteins for quality control and the maintenance of homeostasis of proteins in the ER.

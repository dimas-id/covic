The potential consequences of BVDV genetic and antigenic diversity are far ranging. The complexity of clinical presentations associated with BVDV likely arises from factors encoded by the virus genome. More importantly,prevention and control of BVDV may be complicated by diagnostic and immunization failure resulting from virus diversity. Evolutionary pressures will continue to drive further diversity, making control of BVDV challenging. Current and the potential for future BVDV strain diversity should be considered when designing BVDV control programs both at the individual farm and national herd level.

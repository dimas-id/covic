This study presents the first record of coronavirus in British bats. Alphacoronavirus strains were detected in two of seven bat species, namely Myotis nattereri and M. daubentonii. Virus prevalence was particularly high in the previously unrecognized host M. nattereri, which can live in close proximity to humans.

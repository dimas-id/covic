Sars-CoV-2 virus infection (COVID-19) was observed in China in the last months of 2019. In the following period, this infection spread all over the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the existence of a pandemic. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: Skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and finally skin findings due to COVID- 19 treatment agents. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases and new skin lesion occurence / new skin disease occurence may be due to personal protective equipment. Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could cause itch, dryness and contact dermatitis. Skin findings could also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The incidence of skin lesions because of COVID-19 was reported between 0.2% and 29%. Many skin lesions such as maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain- like, thrombotic / ischemic etc. could be observed in COVID-19. Some authors state that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection specific skin finding is absent. But, especially in asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition skin lesions could occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents. As a result, many skin lesions could appear because of COVID-19. Even if there were no COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carrefully in this pandemic period. Key worlds: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, dermatology, skin findings.

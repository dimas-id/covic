Purpose of review A recent American Academy of Neurology Evidence-Based Practice Guideline on vestibular myogenic evoked potential (VEMP) testing has described superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) and evaluated the merits of VEMP in its diagnosis. SCDS is an uncommon but now well-recognized cause of dizziness and auditory symptoms. This article familiarizes health care providers with this syndrome and the utility and shortcomings of VEMP as a diagnostic test and also explores payment policies for VEMP. Recent findings In carefully selected patients with documented history compatible with the SCDS, both high-resolution temporal bone CT scan and VEMP are valuable aids for diagnosis. Payers might be unfamiliar with both this syndrome and VEMP testing. Summary It is important to raise awareness of VEMP and its possible indications and the rationale for coverage of VEMP testing. Payers may not be readily receptive to VEMP coverage if this test is used in an undifferentiated manner for all common vestibular and auditory symptoms.

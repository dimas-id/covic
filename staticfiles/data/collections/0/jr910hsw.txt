With recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), anthrax, Nipah and the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, much emphasis has been placed on the rapid identification of infectious agents globally. As a result, laboratories are building capacity, conducting more advanced and sophisticated research, increasing their staff, and establishing reference collections of dangerous pathogens in an attempt to reduce the impact of infectious disease outbreaks and to characterise disease-causing agents. With this expansion, the global laboratory community has started to focus on laboratory biosafety and biosecurity in order to prevent the accidental and/or intentional release of these agents. Laboratory biosafety and biosecurity systems are used around the world to help to mitigate the risks posed by dangerous pathogens in the laboratory. Veterinary laboratories carry unique responsibilities with regard to workers and communities to handle disease-causing microorganisms safely and securely. Many microorganisms studied in veterinary laboratories not only infect animals, but also have the potential to infect humans. This paper will discuss the fundamentals of laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.

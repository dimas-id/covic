Weight loss surgery is currently the only treatment that offers significant and sustained weight loss for those with severe and complex obesity. Obesity levels have reached a sustained high, whereby several percent of a country's population would qualify for surgery based upon current national guidelines. Worldwide, the provision of surgery is highly variable and to treat all the affected population, it would require at least a 100-fold increase in the provision of services. This has important cost and commissioning implications for health-care planners. Reliable level 1 evidence of the long-term effects of obesity surgery is still lacking, and the long-term complication profiles and re-operation rates unclear, which could have significant impact on health-care systems in the future. The chronic disease management of obesity in a population must be integrated with education and prevention and the brief intervention of weight loss surgery and the management of its sequelae, to prevent significant future morbidity and mortality.

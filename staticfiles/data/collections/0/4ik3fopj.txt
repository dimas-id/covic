BACKGROUND It remains unclear whether deep neuromuscular blockade results in better postoperative recovery than does moderate neuromuscular blockade. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the effects of deep neuromuscular blockade and moderate neuromuscular blockade on the quality of postoperative recovery in patients undergoing robotic gastrectomy. METHODS In this prospective, double-blind, single-center randomized controlled superiority trial with two parallel groups, 56 adult patients (19-80 years) scheduled for elective robotic gastrectomy were randomly assigned to a moderate neuromuscular blockade group or a deep neuromuscular blockade group in a 1:1 ratio. In the deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade groups, the infusion rate for rocuronium was adjusted to maintain a post-tetanic count of 1-2 or a train-of-four count of 1-2, respectively. The primary outcome was the Quality of Recovery-40 (QoR-40) score on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes included the QoR-40 score on postoperative day 2, intraoperative hemodynamic data, intraoperative respiratory data, visual analog scale score for pain, postoperative incidences of nausea and vomiting, postoperative rescue analgesic use, and postoperative rescue antiemetic use. RESULTS The postoperative QoR-40 score was similar between the two groups on postoperative days 1 and 2. Moreover, the two groups showed no differences in intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory data or postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and rescue medication use. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that the quality of recovery after robotic gastrectomy is similar for deep and moderate neuromuscular blockade. Therefore, deep neuromuscular blockade during robotic gastrectomy may be unnecessary, at least in patients with normal body mass index.

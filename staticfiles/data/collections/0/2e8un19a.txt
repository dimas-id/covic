Abstract With technological developments in manufacturing fields, many advanced materials and alloys have been introduced to fulfill industrial requirements. One of such type of advanced materials, Inconel 625 possesses superior materialistic properties and finds number of industrial applications in Aerospace, Marine, Petro-chemical and Solar power stations etc. However, machining and finishing of Inconel 625 components are still remain difficult tasks to deals with. A recently developed finishing process: Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) process has been experimented to finish Inconel 625 surfaces but this process is not much effective to finish and machine Inconel 625 work surfaces. In present work, Chemically assisted Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (CMAF) process has been experimented for simultaneous internal and external surface finishing of Inconel 625 tubes. An indigenous magnetic tool has been developed using Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. Experiments have been designed by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Effect of five input process parameters i.e. processing time, surface rotational speed, weight percentage (Wt %age) of abrasives, chemical concentration and abrasive size on the material removal (MR) has been analyzed. Experimental Results proves that selected input process parameters have significant effect on material removal (MR). Material is uniformly removed from both internal and external surface of Inconel 625 tubes. Surface microstructure has been analyzed using scanning electron microscopy.

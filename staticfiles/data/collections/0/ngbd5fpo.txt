BACKGROUND Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have re-emerged and spread rapidly worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses. Vaccination is the best way to prevent PEDV infection in young piglets. OBJECTIVE To enhance the efficacy of an inactivated vaccine against PEDV, we evaluated the adjuvant properties of Fc domain of IgG. METHODS Fifteen crossbred gilts (180 ∼ 210 days old) were used. Five pigs in group 1 were intramuscularly vaccinated twice at 4 weeks and 2 weeks prior to farrowing with 106 TCID50 of inactivated PEDV. Five pigs in group 2 were intramuscularly vaccinated twice at 4 weeks and 2 weeks prior to farrowing with 106 TCID50 of inactivated PEDV-sFc. Five pigs in group 3 were not vaccinated and served as negative controls. Serum samples were collected at farrowing and subjected to ELISA, a serum neutralizing (SN) test, and a cytokine assay. Statistical analysis was performed by a two-tailed unpaired t-test. RESULTS Vero cells expressing swine IgG Fc on its surface was established. When PEDV was propagated in the cells expressing the swine Fc, PEDV virion incorporated the Fc. Immunization of pigs with inactivated PEDV harbouring Fc induced significantly higher antibody production against PEDV, comparing to the immunization with normal inactivated PEDV. In addition, we observed significantly increased IFN-γ levels in sera. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that Fc molecule facilitate immune responses and PEDV harbouring Fc molecule could be a possible vaccine candidate. However, a challenge experiment would be needed to investigate the protective efficacy of PEDV harbouring Fc.

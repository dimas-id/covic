Brunei Darussalam is a small equatorial country of 5,765 square kilometers that lies on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo. An affluent nation, its economy is based mostly on oil and gas. Brunei’s GDP per capita of US$50,117 places the country fifth highest on this index internationally (International Monetary Fund, 2010). The population of Brunei is about 398,000, with Malays, who are Muslims, forming the majority (just under 67% of the country’s people) (Prime Minister’s Office, 2008). The annual population growth rate is just over 2.0%; life expectancy is 75 years (Central Intelligence Agency, 2010).

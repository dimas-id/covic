BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Endovascular treatment (EVT) is proven to be safe and effective for treating acute large vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS). The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reflects systemic inflammation, which plays an important role in the process of treating ischemic stroke. This study aims to explore the relationship between NLR and the clinical outcomes of LVOS patients undergoing EVT. METHODS Patients were selected from the EVT for acUte Anterior circuLation (ACTUAL) ischemic stroke registry. The laboratory data (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count) before EVT were collected. Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 3-6 at 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship of NLR with functional outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality. RESULTS We eventually included 616 patients (median of age, 66 years; 40.3% female). There were 350 (56.7%) patients achieving mRS of 3-6 at 3 months, 98 (15.9%) patients with sICH, and the mortality at 3 months was 24.8% (153/616). Baseline NLR was independently associated with poor functional outcome (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02-2.45; p = 0.039) and sICH (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.09-3.11; p = 0.023) but showed a trend for predicting 3-month mortality (OR 1.57; 95% CI 0.94-2.65; p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS NLR independently predicts 3-month functional outcome and sICH but the existence of a trend association with mortality after EVT for acute anterior circulation LVOS patients.

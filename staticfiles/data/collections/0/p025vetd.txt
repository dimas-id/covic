Modern robotics is an advanced minimally invasive technology with the advantages of wristed capability, three-dimensional optics, and tremor filtration compared with conventional laparoscopy. Urologists have been early adopters of robotic surgical technology: robotics have been used in urologic oncology for more than 20 years and there has been an increasing trend for utilization in benign urologic pathology in the last couple of years. The continuing development and interest in robotics are aimed at surgical efficiency as well as patient outcomes. However, despite its advantages, improvements in haptics, system size, and cost are still desired. This article explores the current use of robotics in urology as well as future improvements on the horizon.

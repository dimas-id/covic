1. The adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein (S) and its C-terminal domain (S2) induce apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. 2. Such apoptosis in Vero E6 cells is time- and dose-dependent. 3. The adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SARS-CoV N-terminal domain (S1) and other structural proteins, including E,M and N protein, do not induce apoptosis.

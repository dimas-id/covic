Trail polymerization enables a significant enhancement of the DhITACT system. DhITACT-Trail (DNA hydrogel formation by isothermal amplification of complementary targets trail polymerization) offers a robust diagnosis of target RNA strands in pseudo-serum specimen. This system requires minimum liquid handling as compared to conventional analysis. In addition, a definitive diagnostic result can be achieved within 30 min by an optical detection.

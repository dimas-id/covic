PURPOSE Sterilization via bilateral total salpingectomy is slowly replacing partial salpingectomy, as it is believed to decrease the incidence of ovarian cancer. Our objective was to compare short-term intra and post-operative complication rates of bilateral total salpingectomy versus partial salpingectomy performed during the course of a cesarean delivery. METHODS A large series of tubal sterilizations during cesarean sections were studied in a single tertiary medical center between 1/2014 and 8/2016 before and after a policy change was made, switching from partial salpingectomy to total salpingectomy. Patients who underwent bilateral partial salpingectomy using the modified Pomeroy technique were compared with those who underwent total salpingectomy. Operative length, estimated blood loss, postpartum fever, wound infection, need for re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, and blood transfusions were compared. RESULTS During the study period, 149 women met inclusion criteria. Fifty parturients underwent bilateral total salpingectomy and 99 underwent partial salpingectomy in the course of the cesarean section. Demographic, obstetrical, and surgical characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean cesarean section duration was comparable for partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy (a median of 35 min in both groups, P = 0.92). Complications were rare in both groups with no significant differences in rates of postpartum fever, wound infection, re-laparotomy, hospitalization length, estimated blood loss, transfusions, and readmissions within 1-month postpartum. CONCLUSION Rates of short-term complications are similar in patients undergoing bilateral partial salpingectomy and total salpingectomy during cesarean deliveries, making the latter a feasible alternative to the former.

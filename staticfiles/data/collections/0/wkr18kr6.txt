BACKGROUND The therapeutic decision to close patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants entails great uncertainty. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive bedside technique used to monitor mixed regional oxygen saturation. We hypothesized that near-infrared spectroscopy could identify preterm infants at risk of mesenteric hypoperfusion associated with hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus. METHODS This is a prospective observational study including consecutively admitted preterm infants with a gestational age <32 weeks. Mesenteric regional oxygenation was blindly monitored using an INVOS 5100 device. The presence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was routinely confirmed by echocardiography/Doppler. Statistical analysis including Bland-Altman plots was performed to assess near-infrared spectroscopy intraobserver repeatability. RESULTS A total of 72 preterm infants were enrolled. The daily mean regional oxygen saturation for preterm infants was determined both in mesenteric and cerebral regions and plotted against time. We identified a differential temporary baseline. Hemodynamic significant ductus arteriosus was associated with lower blood pressures and lower regional splanchnic oxygenation. There was a significant relationship between reversal diastolic flow in the descending aorta and the regional oxygen saturation, which remained significant after controlling for ductal size and nil per os. CONCLUSIONS The simultaneous monitoring of splanchnic near-infrared spectroscopy and echocardiography could identify low mesenteric perfusion in the presence of hemodynamic ductus arteriosus.

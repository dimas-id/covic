CASE DESCRIPTION An 8-year-old multiparous Thoroughbred broodmare was admitted for evaluation of a rectal tear sustained during parturition. CLINICAL FINDINGS On initial evaluation, the mare had mild signs of abdominal discomfort. A full-thickness rectal tear located 30 cm cranial to the anus and extending approximately 15 cm longitudinally along the surface of the small colon between the 4 and 6 o'clock positions, when viewed from behind, was diagnosed on examination per rectum. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen was performed to assess the tear and extent of peritoneal contamination. A hand-assisted repair via a flank incision was performed. The tear was closed in a single-layer, simple continuous pattern with size-0 polydioxanone with a handheld needle holder. Subsequently, a ventral midline celiotomy was performed, and intestinal contents were evacuated via a pelvic flexure enterotomy and a typhlotomy. Following surgery, the mare was managed with IV fluid therapy, partial parenteral nutrition, antimicrobials, and NSAIDs for 5 to 7 days before being gradually reintroduced to a complete pelleted feed and alfalfa hay. Prior to discharge, examination per rectum revealed no stricture formation associated with repair. The mare was discharged from the hospital and performed successfully as a broodmare, with the delivery of a live foal 1 year after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Successful repair with an excellent outcome was achieved in this mare. Hand-assisted laparoscopic repair should be considered as a possible treatment option in horses with grade IV rectal tears.

The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to more than 70 countries worldwide and there was a higher mortality in those who developed serious illness.Cytokine storm syndrome is an important pathophysiological basis for COVID-19 patients developing into severe or critical conditions. It was indicated in the diagnosis and treatment scheme, by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, that blood purifications such as plasma exchange, plasma adsorption, hemoperfusion, hemofiltration and plasmafiltration could be considered for use in the critical patients with cytokine storm syndrome. This expert consensus, proposed by the Chinese Society of Nephrology and the Nephrology Committee of Chinese Research Hospital Association, is to guide and standardize the clinical application of blood purifications in the treatment of severe or critical patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: How the impact of the COVID‐19 stay‐at‐home orders are influencing physical, mental, and financial health among vulnerable populations, including those with obesity is unknown. The aim of the current study was to explore the health implications of COVID‐19 AMong a sample of adults with obesity. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from an obesity medicine clinic and a bariatric surgery (MBS) practice. Patients completed an online survey from April 15, 2020 to May 31, 2020 to assess COVID‐19 status and health behaviors during stay‐at‐home orders. Logistic regression models examined the impact of these orders on anxiety and depression by ethnic group. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years [SD 13.0], mean BMI 40.2 [SD 6.7], 49.2% Non‐Hispanic white, 28.7% Non‐Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity, 33.1% completed MBS were included. Two patients tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 and 14.6% reported symptoms. 72.8% reported increased anxiety and 83.6% increased depression since stay‐at‐home orders were initiated. 69.6% reported more difficultly in achieving weight loss goals, less exercise time (47.9%) and intensity (55.8%), increased stockpiling of food (49.6%) and stress eating (61.2%). Hispanics were less likely to report anxiety vs non‐Hispanic whites (aOR 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05‐0.49; P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Results here showed the COVID‐19 pandemic is having a significant impact on patients with obesity regardless of infection status. These results can inform clinicians and healthcare professionals about effective strategies to minimize COVID‐19 negative outcomes for this vulnerable population now and in post‐COVID‐19 recovery efforts.

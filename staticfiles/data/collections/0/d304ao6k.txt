Proteolytic cleavage of influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin by host proteases is crucial for virus infectivity and spread. The transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was previously identified as the essential protease that can cleave hemagglutinin of many subtypes of influenza virus and spike protein of coronavirus. Herein, we found that a guanine rich tract, capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex in the presence of potassium ions, in the promoter region of human TMPRSS2 gene was quite important for gene transcriptional activity, hence affecting its function. Furthermore, 7 new synthesized benzoselenoxanthene analogues were found to enable stabilizing such G-quadruplex. More importantly, compounds can down-regulate TMPRSS2 gene expression, especially endogenous TMPRSS2 protein levels, and consequently suppress influenza A virus propagation in vitro. Our results provide a new strategy for anti-influenza A virus infection by small molecules targeting the TMPRSS2 gene G-quadruplex and thus inhibiting TMPRSS2 expression, which is valuable for developing small molecule drugs against influenza A virus and also may be a potential candidate as anti- SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2) lead molecules.

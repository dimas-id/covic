Recent studies published in the Telemedicine and e-Health journal stated the reality in Italy of the importance of telemedicine promotion during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In Italy, we gradually approached the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this phase, the activities restarted according to a temporal plan. During the second phase, "social distancing" will continue and telemedicine will continue to play a pivotal role. Now, during the second phase of the fight against the pandemic, we need: (1) to maintain social distancing; (2) to face new imminent criticalities highlighted in recent studies published in Telemedicine and e-Health; (3) to protect fragile subjects and to support disabled subjects; and (4) to still care/rehabilitate critical patients (still present even if in a decreased number). Telemedicine is still important and must also be rethought. The study, starting from the needs of chronic patients, highlighted in the recent studies published in this journal, expanded the possibilities of multiple opportunities for telemedicine integration during the second phase. An emerged categorization takes into consideration (1) the subjects with fragility, including those with rare diseases; (2) the experience gained during the emergency; (3) the new opportunities emerged for telemedicine boundaries; and (4) the new needs for telemedicine-based pulmonary rehabilitation at home.

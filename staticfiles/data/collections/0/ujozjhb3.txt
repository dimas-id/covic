INTRODUCTION The large global burden of viral infections and especially the rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases and other emerging viral diseases show the need for new approaches in vaccine development. Several new vaccine technology platforms have been developed and are under evaluation. Areas covered: This article discusses the measles vector platform technology derived from the safe and highly efficacious measles virus vaccine. The pipeline of measles-vectored vaccine candidates against viral diseases is reviewed. Particular focus is given to the Chikungunya vaccine candidate as the first measles-vectored vaccine that demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and functionality of the technology in humans even in the presence of pre-existing anti-measles immunity and thus achieved proof of concept for the technology. Expert commentary: Demonstrating no impact of pre-existing anti-measles immunity in humans on the response to the transgene was fundamental for the technology and indicates that the technology is suitable for large-scale immunization in measles pre-immune populations. The proof of concept in humans combined with a large preclinical track record of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy for a variety of pathogens suggest the measles vector platform as promising plug-and-play vaccine platform technology for rapid development of effective preventive vaccines against viral and other infectious diseases.

PURPOSE To evaluate the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using Sonazoid for the diagnosis of the local recurrence after treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by comparing it with dynamic CT. METHODS Seventy-one patients with 87 HCC lesions (mean +/- SD; 19.5 +/- 9.6 mm) underwent CEUS using Sonazoid and dynamic CT after radiofrequency ablation (n = 55), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 22), or radiofrequency ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (n = 10). Two hepatologists (observer 1; 10 years of experience, and 2; 20 years of experience) reviewed the CEUS and dynamic CT images independently and evaluated presence or absence of the local recurrence. Diagnostic performance for the local recurrence was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS The Az value for dynamic CT was significantly lower in observer 1 than 2 (p < 0.05). The sensitivity of CEUS was 79% in observer 1 and 83.9% in observer 2, and that of dynamic CT was 83.9% and 90.3%, respectively. The specificity of CEUS was 96%, and that of dynamic CT was 92%, in both observers. CONCLUSION This study suggests that CEUS using Sonazoid is less affected by the observer's experience and is more accurate in the diagnosis of local recurrence after treatment for HCC than dynamic CT.

The neck region contains around 300 lymph nodes (LNs) out of 800 LNs in the whole body. The detailed study of LNs by Rouviere in 1932 [1] and the later illustration of metastatic predilection of head and neck malignancies to certain LN regions by Lindberg et al. [2] paved the road to a clinically sound classification. The American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) developed the currently widely accepted levels classification of the cervical LNs (Table 8.1, Figs. 8.1 and 8.2).

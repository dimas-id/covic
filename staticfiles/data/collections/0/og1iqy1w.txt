Alterations in arterial blood oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) are strongly associated with intra-hospital cardiac arrests and resuscitations. A wireless, easy-to-use, and comfortable method for monitoring these important clinical signs would be highly useful. We investigated whether the Nellcor™ OxiMask MAX-FAST forehead sensor could provide data for vital sign measurements when located at the distal forearm instead of its intended location at the forehead to provide improved comfortability and easy placement. In a prospective setting, we recruited 30 patients undergoing surgery requiring postoperative care. At the postoperative care unit, patients were monitored for two hours using a standard patient monitor and with a study device equipped with a Nellcor™ Forehead SpO2 sensor. The readings were electronically recorded and compared in post hoc analysis using Bland-Altman plots, Spearman's correlation, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Bland-Altman plot showed that saturation (SpO2) differed by a mean of -0.2 % points (SD, 4.6), with a patient-weighted Spearman's correlation (r) of 0.142, and an RMSE of 4.2 points. For HR measurements, the mean difference was 0.6 bpm (SD, 2.5), r = 0.997, and RMSE = 1.8. For RR, the mean difference was -0.5 1/min (4.1), r = 0.586, and RMSE = 4.0. The SpO2 readings showed a low mean difference, but also a low correlation and high RMSE, indicating that the Nellcor™ saturation sensor cannot reliably assess oxygen saturation at the forearm when compared to finger PPG measurements.

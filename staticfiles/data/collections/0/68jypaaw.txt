The Corona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the significant medical disaster that changed the life of humankind in the 21st century. The deadly virus is transmittable from infected person, through his nasal droplets, to surrounding people among whom, the healthcare personnel are the utmost affected. The present article brings out an innovative chamber, which is used for collection of throat, or nasal swabs/samples for diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected persons. The chamber, called COVid SAmple Collection Kiosk (COVSACK), eliminates the transmission of the deadly virus to the health care personnel while collecting the sample. The kiosk is designed based on CFD simulations for effective spread of disinfectant in fine droplet form, built with a lightweight composite that is sustainable in extreme weather conditions and the kiosk can be easily sanitized within 3 min after sample collection. The chamber is first positioned in ESI Hospital, Hyderabad, and other hospitals and diagnostics centres across India, extensively being used for testing the COVID-19 patients at a faster rate, with a drastic reduction in use of personal protection equipment (PPE). This technological innovation, to certain extent, has changed the way the testing of COVID-19 patients carried out in the country.

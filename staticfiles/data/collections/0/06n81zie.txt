The information on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that has been gathered up to this point has made it possible to prepare recommendations concerning the equipment needed to protect health workers responsible for patient care and for processing potentially infected samples. Protecting such personnel is a key element in the strategy to control the spread of SARS. The needed equipment includes clothing; footwear; such protective devices as masks, safety glasses, and gloves; disinfectant solutions; laboratory equipment; and materials for obtaining and transporting samples. Prepared by the Western Pacific Regional Office of the World Health Organization, this list will help implement measures to contain the epidemic. The list gives the recommended quantities, specifications for the items, and possible alternatives for some items. This list of equipment is not exhaustive; it is intended to provide a small emergency supply for a period of 3 or 4 days for a single isolation unit with approximately 50 workers. To guarantee the availability of the equipment in the needed quantities, infection control authorities should take into account the number of isolation units needed and the length of time that containment measures will need to be in place. Adequate reserves should be available 24 hours a day, and plans should be made for rapid access to larger stocks in the event of a larger outbreak.

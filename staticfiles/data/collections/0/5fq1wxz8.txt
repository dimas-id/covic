Practical relevance A number of systemic diseases are associated with neurological deficits. Most systemic diseases that impact on the nervous system result in multifocal neurological signs; however, isolated deficits can also be observed. This article reviews the clinical signs, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of four important systemic diseases with neurological consequences: feline infectious peritonitis, toxoplasmosis, hypertension and hepatic encephalopathy. Clinical challenges Early recognition of systemic signs of illness in conjunction with neurological deficits will allow for prompt diagnosis and treatment. While neurological examination of the feline patient can undoubtedly be challenging, hopefully the accompanying articles in this special issue will enable the clinician to approach these cases with more confidence. Evidence base The veterinary literature contains numerous reports detailing the impact of systemic disease on the nervous system. Unfortunately, very few references provide detailed descriptions of large cohorts of affected cats. This review summarises the literature underpinning the four key diseases under discussion.

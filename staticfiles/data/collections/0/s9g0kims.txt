Studies published on COVID-19, pregnancy and neonate disease until 30 April 2020 are revised. We found 33 articles including 553 pregnant women and 456 deliveries. The more frequent symptoms in the pregnant women were fever, cough and dyspnoea. About two thirds deliveries were carried out via Caesarean rate; 5.9% women were admitted in the ICU and 4% required mechanic ventilation. No maternal death was reported. Prematurity occurred in 22.3% deliveries and 38.3% neonates required admission in the ICU. Only one neonatal death was reported (0.4%) and 13 neonates (3.4%) suffered COVID-19. The available information does not allow to state whether transmission to neonates occurred transplacentarily.

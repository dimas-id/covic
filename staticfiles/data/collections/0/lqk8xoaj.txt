Proliferation of central nervous system (CNS) glia in response to peripheral nerve injury occurs without apparent participation of cells of the immune system. It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucleus. It is demonstrated by double-immunofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased levels of MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that microglia are immunocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immubological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.

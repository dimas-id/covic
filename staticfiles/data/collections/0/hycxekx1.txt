Associations between respiratory infections and asthma inception and exacerbations are well established. Infant respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections are known to be associated with an increased risk of asthma development, and among children with prevalent asthma, 85% of asthma exacerbations are associated with viral infections. However, the exact nature of this relationship remains unclear. Is the increase in severity of infections an epiphenomenon, meaning respiratory infections just appear more severe in individuals with underlying respiratory disease, or instead a reflection of altered host susceptibility among persons with asthma and atopic disease? The main focus of this review is to summarize the available levels of evidence supporting or refuting the notion that persons with asthma or atopic disease have an altered susceptibility to selected pathogens, as well as discussing the biological mechanism(s) that might explain such associations. Finally, we will outline areas in need of further research, as understanding the relationships between infections and asthma has important implications for both asthma prevention and treatment, including potential new pathways that might target host immune response to select pathogens.

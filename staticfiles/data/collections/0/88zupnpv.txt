The COVID-19 pandemic has kept the world in suspense for the past months. In most federal countries such as Germany, locally varying conditions demand for state- or county-level decisions. However, this requires a deep understanding of the meso-scale outbreak dynamics between micro-scale agent models and macro-scale global models. Here, we introduce a reparameterized SIQRD network model that accounts for local political decisions to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of the pandemic in Germany at county and city resolution. Our optimized model reproduces state-wise cumulative infections and deaths as reported by the Robert-Koch Institute, and predicts development for individual counties at convincing accuracy. We demonstrate the dominating effect of local infection seeds, and identify effective measures to attenuate the rapid spread. Our model has great potential to support decision makers on a state and community politics level to individually strategize their best way forward.

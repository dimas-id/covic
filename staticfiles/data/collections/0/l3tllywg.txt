In this study, Donghua Hospital information management system and Meikang clinical pharmacy management system were used to collect medical records of all inpatients diagnosed as coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in Wuhan Third Hospital. The statistics was based on the data of the cases treated with Ganlu Xiaodu Decoction, including demographic statistics, clinical cha-racteristics before medication, outcome of after medication and efficacy of drug combination. Excel 2003 and SPSS Clementine 12.0 software were used to conduct statistics on the included cases, and Apriori algorithm and association rules were used for the association analysis on drug combination. A total of 131 cases of COVID-19 were treated with Ganlu Xiaodu Decoction combined with Chinese and Western medicine. All of the patients were cured and discharged. The drug combination mainly included Ganlu Xiaodu Decoction, abidor, Lianhua Qingwen, moxifloxacin, Qiangli Pipa Lu, vitamin C, glycyrrhizinate diammonium, pantoprazole and Shufeng Jiedu. There is a certain regularity and effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 infection patients with the combination of Ganlu Xiaodu Decoction and other drugs, but the rationality and safety still need to be further verified.

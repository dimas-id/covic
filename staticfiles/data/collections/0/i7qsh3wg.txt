I have read with interest the article entitled Evidence of the COVID-19 Virus Targeting the CNS: Tissue Distribution, Host-Virus Interaction, and Proposed Neurotropic Mechanisms by Baig et al. 1. This letter is supposed to supplement the aforementioned article with expanded scope on pathophysiological mechanisms which could prove salient in elucidating pathogenesis, seeking treatment, or considering clinical implications.

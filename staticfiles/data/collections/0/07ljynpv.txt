Hospital-associated transmission is an important route of spreading the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and pneumonia (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) [1]. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk while combating COVID-19 at the very frontline, and nosocomial outbreaks among HCWs are not unusual in similar settings; the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak led to over 966 HCW infections with 1.4% deaths in mainland China [2]. As of 11 February 2020, 3019 HCWs might have been infected with 2019-nCov in China, 1716 HCW cases were confirmed by nucleic acid testing[3], and at least 6 HCWs died, including the famous whistleblower Dr Li Wenliang. In view of this severe situation, we are recommending urgent interventions to help to protect HCWs.

BACKGROUND The Derivo Embolization Device (DED) is a novel flow diverter with advanced X-ray visibility, potentially lower thrombogenicity, and an improved delivery system. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DED for emergency treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. METHODS Between February 2016 and March 2018, 10 patients (median age 54.5 years, seven women) with 11 aneurysms were treated with the DED at three neurovascular centers. Procedural details, complications, morbidity, and aneurysm occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta scale, OKM) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Among 11 aneurysms treated, there were nine anterior circulation and two posterior circulation aneurysms. Aneurysm morphology was saccular in four cases, dissecting in three, blister-like in three, and fusiform in one. In each case, a single DED was implanted and deployment was technically successful without exception. Adjunctive coiling was performed in two aneurysms. We observed one in-stent thrombosis, presumably due to low response to clopidogrel 4 days after the procedure, which remained with a mild hemiparesis after aspiration thrombectomy. No further thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events occurred. Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score â‰¤2) at last follow-up was achieved in all patients. Among 10 aneurysms available for angiographic follow-up, complete aneurysm occlusion (OKM D) was obtained in nine cases (90.0%). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms with the DED was feasible and not associated with any incidence of rebleeding. Larger series with longer follow-up are warranted to reach a definite conclusion about this device.

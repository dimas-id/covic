The discovery of large numbers of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been driven by genome-wide transcriptional analyses. Compared to small ncRNAs, lncRNAs have been shown to harbor biological activities, but the functions of the great majority of lncRNAs are not known. There is growing evidence that lncRNAs can regulate gene expression at epigenetic, transcription, and post-transcription levels and widely take part in various physiological and pathological processes, such as participating in cell development, immunity, oncogenesis, clinical disease processes, etc. Here, the current research efforts on the function of lncRNA in recent years were summarized.

The multiplicity of threats and vulnerabilities associated with AmI will require a multiplicity of safeguards to respond to the risks and problems posed by the emerging technological systems and their applications. In some instances, a single safeguard might be sufficient to address a specified threat or vulnerability. More typically, however, a combination of safeguards will be necessary to address each threat and vulnerability. In still other instances, one safeguard might apply to numerous treats and vulnerabilities. One could depict these combinations in a matrix or on a spreadsheet, but the spreadsheet would quickly become rather large and, perhaps, would be slightly misleading. Just as the AmI world will be dynamic, constantly changing, the applicability of safeguards should also be regarded as subject to a dynamic, i.e., different and new safeguards may need to be introduced in order to cope with changes in the threats and vulnerabilities.

Flocking model has been widely used in robotic swarm control. However, the traditional model still has some problems such as manually adjusted parameters, poor stability and low adaptability when dealing with autonomous navigation tasks in large-scale groups and complex environments. Therefore, it is an important and meaningful research problem to automatically generate Optimized Flocking model (O-flocking) with better performance and portability. To solve this problem, we design Comprehensive Flocking (C-flocking) model which can meet the requirements of formation keeping, collision avoidance of convex and non-convex obstacles and directional movement. At the same time, Genetic Optimization Framework for Flocking Model (GF) is proposed. The important parameters of C-flocking model are extracted as seeds to initialize the population, and the offspring are generated through operations such as crossover and mutation. The offspring model is input into the experimental scene of autonomous navigation for robotic swarms, and the comprehensive fitness function value is obtained. The model with smallest value is selected as the new seed to continue evolution repeatedly, which finally generates the O-flocking model. The extended simulation experiments are carried out in more complex scenes, and the O-flocking and C-flocking are compared. Simulation results show that the O-flocking model can be migrated and applied to large-scale and complex scenes, and its performance is better than that of C-flocking model in most aspects.

Abstract Common marmosets are highly susceptible to several viral pathogens that exist as latent or subclinical infections in their natural reservoir hosts but cause severe disease or death when interspecies transmission occurs. Examples of such viruses in marmosets are herpes simplex virus infections, parainfluenza virus 1 infections, and measles acquired from humans, Saimiriine herpesvirus 1 infection after transmission from squirrel monkeys, and infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus originating from mice. Other relevant viral infections causing spontaneous disease in common marmoset colonies include cowpox virus infections and paramyxovirus saguinus infections. Callitrichine herpesvirus 3 is a newly recognized lymphocryptovirus that is associated with the development of intestinal lymphoproliferative disease in common marmosets. Most viral pathogens causing disease in common marmosets are potential zoonotic agents, and protective measures should be implemented when handling these small New World monkeys.

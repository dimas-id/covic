The relationship between Renin‐Angiotensin system (RAS) and COVID‐19 pandemic and, in particular, RAS as part of the CoV‐2 infection process via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry point of SARS‐CoV‐2, has resulted in conflicting suggestions regarding how RAS and its role(s) should inform treating COVID‐19. ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang)‐type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), in fact, have been suggested to be avoided as they potentially upregulate ACE2 (1) and, conversely, there are suggestions that ARBs might be beneficial (2) as SARS‐CoV‐2 causing ACE2 downregulation slows the Ang II conversion to the vasodilatory, anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic Ang 1‐7 (3‐5), and the use of ARBs by blocking the excessive Ang II type‐1 receptors activation, would be beneficial upregulating ACE2 activity and increasing Ang 1‐7 levels.

INTRODUCTION More than 20 orally bioavailable chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) antagonists have moved forward to clinical development in recent years for the treatment of asthma. However, evidence from individual randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has demonstrated inconsistent results in their efficacy and safety. METHODS AND ANALYSIS PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus will be searched from inception to 30 December 2017 for eligible RCTs, with additional studies being identified by manual searches. The study eligibility, data extraction and quality appraisal will be performed by two independent reviewers. Studies deemed fit for inclusion will be assessed using Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. To generate more accurate analyses, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation will be used to grade the evidence. We will use the Ï‡2 test and the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. The metaregression and subgroup analyses will be undertaken in the presence of heterogeneity. The potential for publication bias will be examined using funnel plots. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The current study is based on published data, thus ethical approval is not a requirement. The results of this study will be reported in an open-access peer-reviewed publication or will be disseminated as conference proceedings. This systematic review will increase the understanding of the application of CRTH2 antagonists in patients with asthma, which may help to establish and identify specific gaps in the evidence informing a future agenda for asthma research, policy and practice.

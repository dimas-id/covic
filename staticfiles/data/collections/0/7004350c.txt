ADP-ribosylation of proteins was first described in the early 1960's, and today the function and regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is partially understood. By contrast, little is known about intracellular mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) by ADP-ribosyl transferase (ART) enzymes, such as ARTD10. Recent findings indicate that MARylation regulates signalling and transcription by modifying key components in these processes. Emerging evidence also suggests that specific macrodomain-containing proteins, including ARTD8, macroD1, macroD2 and C6orf130, which are distinct from those affecting PARylation, interact with MARylation on target proteins to 'read' and 'erase' this modification. Thus, studying macrodomain-containing proteins is key to understanding the function and regulation of MARylation.

In selected cases, cuffed tunneled catheters via the iliac vein are implanted as a last resort access for hemodialysis. To monitor the correct position, sonography of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is sufficient in most cases. Position control using an X-ray of the abdomen is not routinely recommended when femoral catheters are implanted. In this report, we describe the case of a 59-year-old patient on chronic hemodialysis due to granulomatosis with polyangiitis and complex shunt history with multiple shunt occlusions and revisions. The implantation of an iliac-cuffed tunneled catheter led to complications because the catheter was malpositioned into the left ascending lumbar vein (ALV). It is important to be aware of potential incorrect positioning of dialysis catheters into the ALV. Due to the anatomical relation to the IVC, this happens more frequently on the left side than on the right side. In case of doubt, the correct placement of large-bore catheters via iliac access route should be verified by means of appropriate imaging before hemodialysis is performed.

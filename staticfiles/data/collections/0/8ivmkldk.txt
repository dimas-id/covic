Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) papain‐like protease (PLpro), a deubiquitinating enzyme, demonstrates inactivation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 and NF‐κB, reduction of IFN induction, and suppression of type I IFN signaling pathway. This study investigates cytokine expression and proteomic change induced by SARS‐CoV PLpro in human promonocyte cells. PLpro significantly increased TGF‐β1 mRNA expression (greater than fourfold) and protein production (greater than threefold). Proteomic analysis, Western blot, and quantitative real‐time PCR assays indicated PLpro upregulating TGF‐β1‐associated genes: HSP27, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, retinal dehydrogenase 2, and glutathione transferase omega‐1. PLpro‐activated ubiquitin proteasome pathway via upregulation of ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme E2–25k and proteasome subunit alpha type 5. Proteasome inhibitor MG‐132 significantly reduced expression of TGF‐β1 and vimentin. PLpro upregulated HSP27, linking with activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling. Treatment with SB203580 and U0126 reduced PLpro‐induced expression of TGF‐β1, vimentin, and type I collagen. Results point to SARS‐CoV PLpro triggering TGF‐β1 production via ubiquitin proteasome, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2‐mediated signaling.

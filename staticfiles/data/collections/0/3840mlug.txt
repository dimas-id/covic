A set of diphenyl ether derivatives bearing different heterocycles were synthesized from 4-phenoxybenzohydrazide 1 in good yield. Synthesized compounds were screened against a broad panel of viruses in different cell cultures and some of the synthesized compounds showed promising antiviral properties.

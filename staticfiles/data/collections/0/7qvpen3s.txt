We herein present a case of hepatic cysts causing obstructive jaundice that was treated with single-incision laparoscopic deroofing. A 72-year-old female patient was referred to hospital due to a large hepatic cyst that compressed the intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient was scheduled to undergo single-incision laparoscopic deroofing. The EZ ACCESS(TM) oval type (Hakko Co. Ltd.) was placed at the umbilicus using a 25-mm incision with two 5-mm trocars. An additional 12-mm port was placed at the left epigastric region. We unroofed and excised the cyst wall using a vessel sealing system in liver segment 4. After surgery, the patient was found to be asymptomatic. The unroofed cysts were completely diminished. Notably, the remnant liver had fairly regenerated. The estimated regeneration volume of the normal liver was 153 cm(3). To prevent surgical complications, clinicians should perform adequate management and use of devices. To prevent postoperative recurrence of cysts, performing complete deroofing is essential. Single-incision laparoscopic deroofing contributes to improving the quality of life of patients and should be considered a standard treatment.

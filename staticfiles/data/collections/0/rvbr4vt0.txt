Cyanine dyes are widely used in biotechnology due to their ability to form fluorescent complexes with nucleic acids. This chapter describes how the structure of the dye determines the mode in which it binds to nucleic acids as well as the fluorescence properties of the resulting complexes. Related dyes, such as hemicyanines and styryl dyes, are briefly described as well. In addition, covalent conjugates of cyanines with nucleic acids or with nucleic acid-binding ligands allow fluorescent labeling and probing of DNA/RNA structure and function. Several examples of different types of conjugates and their applications are described.

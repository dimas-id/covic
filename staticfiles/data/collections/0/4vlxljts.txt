Abstract The nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that plays a vital role in viral replication. This study first demonstrated that the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with cellular retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and Nsp9 co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Next, the overexpression of truncated pRb was shown to inhibit the PRRSV replication and silencing the pRb gene could facilitate the PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. Finally, the pRb level was confirmed to be down-regulated in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and Nsp9 was shown to promote the pRb degradation by proteasome pathway. These findings indicate that the interaction of Nsp 9 with pRb benefits the replication of genotype 2 PRRSV in vitro, helping to understand the roles of Nsp9 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV.

The efficacy of paracetamol (acetaminophen) as an antipyretic during febrile neutropenia (FN) has not previously been established. We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled feasibility trial: hemato-oncology patients at high FN risk were randomly assigned to six hourly oral paracetamol (1 g) or placebo during the first 42 hours of FN. Fifty-three participants were screened, thirty-seven enrolled; 22 developed FN and commenced treatment (13 paracetamol; 9 placebo); recruitment rates were below, and retention rates met, pre-defined feasibility criteria. During the first 24 hours of FN, paracetamol recipients had significantly lower peak temperature than placebo: mean 38.2 (standard deviation 0.8) °C versus 38.9 (0.4) °C; difference -0.78 °C (95% CI -1.38 to -0.18); p = .013. Bacterial load measurement was not informative. Paracetamol lowers body temperature during FN, and definitive trials to determine its impact on FN outcomes are needed.

Digital health tools are providing patients with easier ways to keep track of their blood glucose levels and other key self-reported data, such as carbohydrates ingested, medication administered, and physical activity. Data are often uploaded into the cloud where physicians and other members of the care team can access them. Clinical studies are beginning to demonstrate efficacy of some of these tools, and Food and Drug Administration approval, when present, provides some much-needed validation. It is anticipated that these tools will continue to evolve and patient acceptance will continue to grow. Physician and care teams will need to familiarize themselves with the tools their patients are using and provide guidance and support for their use.

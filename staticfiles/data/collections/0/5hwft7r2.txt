The mechanisms of hepatic reticuloendothelial cell dysfunction in obstructive jaundice were investigated using cultured hamster Kupffer cells. The introduction of free bile acids, cholic acid (CA) at concentrations over 2 mM and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) over 1 mM inhibited colloidal carbon pinocytosis. CA and CDCA at concentrations over 0.5 mM inhibited IgG-coated sheep red blood cell phagocytosis. With the application of conjugated bile acid and endotoxin at concentrations over 50 μg/ml, endocytic function was inhibited. With bile acids, a dose-dependent increase in the concentration of β-glucuronidase occurred in the culture medium, and with endotoxin a timedependent increase in β-glucuronidase was noted. Bile acids produced alterations in cell organelles before destruction of the cell membrane. The presence of endotoxin led to the appearance of large vacuoles in the cytoplasm. These observations suggest that bile acids and endotoxin inhibit Kupffer cells by different mechanisms. We tentatively conclude that bile acids rather than endotoxin influence Kupffer cells in vivo.

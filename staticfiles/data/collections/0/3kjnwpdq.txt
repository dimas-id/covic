1,3-Dipolar cycloaddition of N-methyl C-(diethoxyphosphoryl) nitrone to N3-substituted 6-bromo-2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-ones gave (3-diethoxyphosphoryl) isoxazolidines substituted at C5 with quinazolinones modified at N3. All isoxazolidine cycloadducts were screened for antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses. Several isoxazolidines inhibited the replication of both thymidine kinase wild-type and deficient (TK(+) and TK(−)) varicella-zoster virus strains at EC(50) in the 5.4–13.6 μΜ range, as well as human cytomegalovirus (EC(50) = 8.9–12.5 μΜ). Isoxazolidines trans-11b, trans-11c, trans-11e, trans-11f/cis-11f, trans-11g, trans-11h, and trans-11i/cis-11i exhibited moderate cytostatic activity towards the human lymphocyte cell line CEM (IC(50) = 9.6–17 μM).

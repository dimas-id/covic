Various surgical techniques have been described for repair of chest wall defects in Poland syndrome. We describe the case of a 16-year-old boy who underwent autologous rib transposition after sternal osteotomy. Chest wall stabilization was achieved using a combination of K-wires and Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (Synthes GmbH, Freiburg, Germany). Reconstruction of the soft tissue defect was accomplished by combined latissimus dorsi muscle flap and Permacol patch (Covidien Deutschland GmbH, Neustadt, Germany). This approach might be considered an effective 1-stage treatment option of this condition in postpubescent boys.

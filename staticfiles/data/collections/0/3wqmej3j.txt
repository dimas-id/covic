The Enigma(Â®) ML FluAB-RSV assay (Enigma Diagnostics, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK) is a CE-IVD marked multiplex molecular panel for the detection of influenza A, B and respiratory syncytial viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs. The assay runs on the fully automated Enigma ML platform without further specimen manipulation and provides a sample-to-answer result within 95 min. The reported sensitivity and specificity for influenza A are 100% (95% CI: 98.2-100) and 98.3% (95% CI: 95.5-99.4), respectively, for influenza B are 100% (95% CI: 98.2-100) and 98.7% (95% CI: 96-99.6), respectively, and for respiratory syncytial virus are 100% (95% CI: 98.2-100) and 99.4% (95% CI: 97.2-99.9), respectively.

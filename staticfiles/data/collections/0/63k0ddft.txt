BACKGROUND During the 'containment' phase of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic 2009, antivirals were used for treatment and prophylaxis. This audit aimed to review the speed of the process involved in delivering antivirals and to assess whether this was likely to have occurred fast enough to be in keeping with the aims of reducing transmission. METHODS Flu Response Centres in each region were tasked with co-ordinating local delivery and all case data were entered into Fluzone (an electronic case management system). All data between 1 June and 2 July in the Yorkshire and Humber region were reviewed. Forty-eight hours from the onset of illness to treatment and prophylaxis were used as reference standards. RESULTS The median estimate for the earliest point cases could have received treatment was 2 days (95% CI 2-3 days) and the earliest point contacts of cases could have received prophylaxis was 4 days (95% CI 4-5 days). CONCLUSIONS The logistical difficulties of delivering 'containment' according to the national algorithms meant there were significant time delays involved and that this was likely to have reduced the effectiveness of the strategy. This would be important to consider if a 'containment' strategy was to be employed in any future emergency.

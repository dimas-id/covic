PURPOSE: This article aims to analyze the intersections between delirium, physical exercise and rehabilitation, to better understand their interrelation and to visualize future lines of research. METHODS: In this narrative review, after an overview of brain neurophysiology and function, as common substrates to understand the relationship between delirium and physical function, we explore the scientific evidence in: (1) physical dysfunction as a risk factor for delirium; (2) physical dysfunction as a symptom of delirium and (3) functional consequences related to delirium. Later, we analyze the physical therapy as one of the main strategies in multicomponent interventions to prevent delirium, by examining intervention studies including rehabilitation, which have shown to be effective in managing delirium. Finally, we analyze how frailty, delirium and physical exercise interact with each other. RESULTS: This review confirms the close relationship between delirium and physical dysfunction; therefore, it is not surprising that physical exercise is widely used in delirium preventive strategies. Although delirium is catalogued as a neurocognitive disorder, scientific evidence shows that it is also a motor disorder, which is to be expected, since a vast body of literature already supports an interaction between motor and cognitive function. CONCLUSION: The motor component of delirium should be taken into account when designing interventions or strategies to address delirium. These interventions may have a special importance in frail older adults.

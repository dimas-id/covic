BACKGROUND Accessing the normal distal vessel in treatment of wide-necked giant intracranial aneurysms with flow diversion can be difficult. CASE DESCRIPTION Through illustrative cases, the authors present several useful techniques in distal access of wide-necked giant aneurysms during flow diversion treatment. Obtaining an optimal projection that separates the outflow limb from the aneurysm is most critical. Each of the three techniques described enabled the distal access to giant intracranial aneurysms during treatment with flow diversion. CONCLUSION The looped-around technique, balloon-assisted technique, and retrograde access are valuable strategies in crossing the aneurysm if direct distal access cannot be obtained.

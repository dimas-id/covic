Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences is crucial in determining the effectiveness of prudent safer at home measures in the United States (US). By haplotype analysis of 6,356 US isolates, we identified a pattern of strongly localized outbreaks at the city-, state-, and country-levels, and temporal transmissions. This points to the effectiveness of existing travel restriction policies and public health measures in controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

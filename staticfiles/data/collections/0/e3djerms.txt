BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection has high transmissibility and several measures have been adopted for controlling its dissemination OBJECTIVE: To identify and summarize the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews (SRs) regarding measures for controlling the dissemination of COVID-19 infection DESIGN AND SETTING: This review of Cochrane SRs was carried out in the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and in the Division of Emergency Medicine and Evidence-Based Medicine of Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Brazil METHODS: A comprehensive search in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews retrieved all Cochrane SRs directly related to measures for controlling COVID-19 dissemination The main characteristics and results of all the SRs included were summarized and discussed RESULTS: Three Cochrane SRs were included in the qualitative synthesis These evaluated population-based and individual measures for controlling the dissemination of COVID-19 CONCLUSION: Low-certainty evidence shows that quarantine for people exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases prevented 44% to 81% of incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths, compared with situations of no measures Moreover, the sooner the quarantine measures were implemented, the greater the cost savings were High-confidence evidence showed that clear communication about infection control and prevention guidelines was vital for successful implementation Low-certainty evidence showed that healthcare professionals with long gowns were less exposed to contamination than were those using coveralls In addition, coveralls were more difficult to doff Further SRs on controlling the dissemination of COVID-19 infection are desirable

OBJECT WEB is an innovative intrasaccular treatment for intracranial aneurysms. Preliminary series have shown good safety and efficacy. The WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm Therapy (WEBCAST) trial is a prospective European trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of WEB in wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. METHODS Patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms for which WEB treatment was indicated were included in this multicentergood clinical practices study. Clinical data including adverse events and clinical status at 1 and 6 months were collected and independently analyzed by a medical monitor. Six-month follow-up digital subtraction angiography was also performed and independently analyzed by a core laboratory. Success was defined at 6 months as complete occlusion or stable neck remnant, no worsening in angiographic appearance from postprocedure, and no retreatment performed or planned. RESULTS Ten European neurointerventional centers enrolled 51 patients with 51 aneurysms. Treatment with WEB was achieved in 48 of 51 aneurysms (94.1%). Adjunctive implants (coils/stents) were used in 4 of 48 aneurysms (8.3%). Thromboembolic events were observed in 9 of 51 patients (17.6%), resulting in a permanent deficit (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] Score 1) in 1 patient (2.0%). Intraoperative rupture was not observed. Morbidity (mRS score > 2) and mortality were 2.0% (1 of 51 patients, related to rupture status on entry to study) and 0.0% at 1 month, respectively. Success was achieved at 6 months in 85.4% of patients treated with WEB: 23 of 41 patients (56.1%) had complete occlusion, 12 of 41 (29.3%) had a neck remnant, and 6 of 41 (14.6%) had an aneurysm remnant. CONCLUSIONS The WEBCAST study showed good procedural and short-term safety of aneurysm treatment with WEB and good 6-month anatomical results.

Insufficient renal artery length for renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is defined as having a main renal artery shorter than 20 mm in length. Such an anatomy is considered a contraindication for most of the currently available endovascular RDN devices. The concern stems from the need to distribute the ablation points to effect circumferential ablation causing sympathetic denervation, without the risk of injuring the renal artery. We postulate that if the requisite ablation points could be distributed between large caliber renal branches and the short main renal artery, RDN is likely feasible and safe. We demonstrate this with 2 cases using 2 different RDN devices and detail the technical feasibility.

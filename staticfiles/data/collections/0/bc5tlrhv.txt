@#Since the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia(COVID-19)has rapidly spread in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. This has aroused great concern of the Chinese government and the international community. There have been unconfirmed threads of COVID-19 patients with conjunctivitis as the first symptom. Therefore, the issue that whether and how the novel coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through the ocular surface has become a new concern. In the absence of clinical and experimental evidence of COVID-19 in ocular infection, we have conducted a retrospective literature analysis of viral pathogens that simultaneously trigger ocular lesions during the onset of epidemic diseases. The purpose of this paper is to provide some reference and suggestions for appropriately understanding of ocular protection in the prevention and control of the COVID-19.

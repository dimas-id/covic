Comparisons of the external morphology and analysis of osteological features of the postcranial and appendicular skeletons of three southwestern Atlantic flatfish species of the genus Paralichthys (P. isosceles, P. orbignyanus and P. patagonicus) were carried out. Bones are described, and detailed morphological, morphometric and meristic characteristics of these flounders are given in order to provide information about the external and internal morphology of three species of Paralichthys occurring in the south-west Atlantic waters that add new information and will help regarding within the framework of a phylogenetic study of the group. Interspecific differences were found in the number of vertebrae and intermuscular bones, as well as in the morphology and morphometry of vertebrae, caudal skeletons, pectoral and pelvic girdle bones. Relationships between bones are discussed and bone characteristics compared with those found in other species of Paralichthys and in other pleuronectiform species. The position of Paralichthys isosceles within Paralichthys is discussed, along with other congeners such as P. triocellatus and P. oblongus.(AU)

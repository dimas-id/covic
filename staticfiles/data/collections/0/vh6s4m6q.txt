Aims: This work aims to characterize the utility of four newly generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Methods and Results: Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the N‐terminal half of spike protein (S1 protein) of TGEV were identified. Affinity constant of these mAbs was analysed. These mAbs were capable of reacting with the TGEV S1 protein analysed by ELISA and Western blot. A competition assay between the different mAbs was performed to determine whether the different antibodies mapped in the same or a different antigenic region of the protein. Investigation on the neutralizing ability of these mAbs indicated that two of these mAbs completely neutralized TGEV at an appropriate concentration. These mAbs were able to detect the TGEV‐infected cells in immunofluorescence assays and Western blot. Moreover, they differentiated TGEV S protein from other control proteins. Conclusions: The generated four mAbs are very specific, and the established immunofluorescence assays, Western blot and discrimination ELISA are useful approaches for detecting of TGEV. Significance and Impact of the Study: It is a novel report regarding the use of the S1 protein of TGEV to generate specific mAbs. Their utility and the established immunoassays contribute to the surveillance of TGE coronavirus.

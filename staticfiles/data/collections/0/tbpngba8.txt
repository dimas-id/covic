Abstract The ubiquitinâ€“proteasome system is known to be utilized by coxsackievirus to facilitate its propagation within the host cells. The present study explores the role of tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPPII), a serine peptidase contributing to protein turnover by acting downstream of the proteasome, in regulating coxsackievirus infection. Inhibition of TPPII does not affect virus replication in cells with functional proteasome. However, when the proteasome is impaired, TPPII appears to serve as an alternative to maintain low levels of virus infection. Our results suggest an important function of TPPII in the maintenance of viral growth and may have implications for anti-viral therapy.

Live bacteria contain a variety of intracellular biomolecules that have specific excitation and emission wavelength spectra characterizing their intrinsic fluorescence. This paper reviews recent developed methods using bacterial intrinsic fluorescence for identification and characterization purposes. Potential applications of such methods at the industrial level are also addressed.

Wound healing complications associated with total knee arthroplasty present a considerable challenge to the orthopaedic surgeon. To ensure preservation of a functional joint, the management of periprosthetic soft-tissue defects around the knee requires rapid assessment, early and aggressive d√©bridement, and durable, contoured coverage. Several reconstructive options are available to tailor soft-tissue coverage to the location, size, and depth of the wound. Special consideration should be given to the timing of the intervention, management of infection, and prosthesis salvage. The merits of each reconstructive option, including perforator, fasciocutaneous, muscular, and free microvascular flaps, should be weighed to select the most appropriate option. The proposed approach can guide surgeons in treating patients with these complex soft-tissue defects.

In 17 months 2198 children had admission urines cultured for CMV. 4.7% had CMV viruria (105 positive cultures), but significant age differences were observed. In the intensive care nursery the prevalence of CMV viruria (congenital and acquired infections) was 3.3% (18 of 551 newborns with viruria). On the nursing units for children ages 0 to 2 yrs, the prevalence of CMV viruria was 6.8% (32 of 544 positive, P<0.01, Chi square=7.3, when compared to newborns). The prevalence of CMV viruria on a nursing unit for children ages 2 to 5 yrs was 7.2% (27 of 382), similar to that for children 0 to 2 yrs (P>0.5 Chi square=0.004). On a nursing unit for children ages 5 to 12 yrs the prevalence of CMV viruria decreased to 4.2% (20 of 476, P=0.01, Chi square=6.6 when compared to children 2 to 5 yrs). For 12 to 18 year olds the prevalence of CMV viruria was only 1.2% (3 of 245, P<.001, Chi square=9.2, when compared to children 5 to 12 yrs). Among 72 seronegative nurses with daily patient contact, none acquired CMV but only 20 worked with the high prevalence age group (0 to 5 yrs). These results suggest that in spite of constant exposure CMV transmission occurs infrequently.

INTRODUCTION OR BACKGROUND Crowdsourced R&D, a research methodology increasingly applied to medical research, has properties well suited to large-scale medical data collection and analysis, as well as enabling rapid research responses to crises such as disease outbreaks. SOURCES OF DATA Multidisciplinary literature offers diverse perspectives of crowdsourced R&D as a useful large-scale medical data collection and research problem-solving methodology. AREAS OF AGREEMENT Crowdsourced R&D has demonstrated 'proof of concept' in a host of different biomedical research applications. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY A wide range of quality and ethical issues relate to crowdsourced R&D. GROWING POINTS The rapid growth in applications of crowdsourced R&D in medical research is predicted by an increasing body of multidisciplinary theory. AREAS FOR TIMELY RESEARCH Further research in areas such as artificial intelligence may allow better coordination and management of the high volumes of medical data and problem-solving inputs generated by the crowdsourced R&D process.

We assessed the effects of apparent temperature (AT) on mortality and the effect modifications attributable to individual characteristics in Hong Kong with subtropical climate conditions. Two datasets are used for analyses: one from mortality data of the general elderly population in 1998–2009; the other from an elderly cohort with 66,820 subjects recruited in 1998–2001 with mortality outcomes followed up until 2009. We found that AT below 20.8 °C was associated with an increase in mortality risk of 1.99% (95% confidence interval: 0.64%, 2.64%) for all causes, 2.48% (0.57%, 4.36%) for cardiovascular disease, and 3.19% (0.59%, 5.73%) for respiratory disease for every 1 °C decrease in AT over the following 3 days. The associations were modified by sex and body mass index, in particular stronger associations were observed for females and for obese subjects.

Since the events of 11 September 2001, there have been several attempts against the security of aircraft in flight. These threats have ranged from shoe bombs to dirty bombs to explosives that can be assembled in flight with liquids, aerosols and gels. In every instance the global community has reacted with pre emptive and preventive measures which prohibit any material on board which might seemingly endanger the safety of flight. Some jurisdictions have even gone to extremes in prohibiting human breast milk and prescriptive medications on board.

Abstract: Restrictions enacted to reduce the spreading of COVID-19 have resulted in notably clearer skies around the world. In this study, we confirm that reduced levels of air pollution correlate with unusually high levels of clear sky insolation in Delhi, India. Restrictions here were announced on March 19th, with the Nation going into lockdown on March 24th. Comparing insolation data before and after these dates with insolation from previous years (2017 to 2019) we observe an 8.3±1.7 % higher irradiance than usual in late March and a 5.9±1.6 % higher one in April, while we find no significant differences to values from previous years in February or early March. Using results from a previous study, we calculated the expected increase in insolation based on measured PM2.5 concentration levels. Measurements and calculations agree within confidence intervals, suggesting that reduced pollution levels are a major cause for the observed increase in insolation.

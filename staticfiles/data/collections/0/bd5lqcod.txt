Recently, Baumann et al. described the characteristics and outcomes of four patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed with symptomatic COVID‐19. The course of the disease was mild, and no patient required admission in an intensive care unit. The authors speculate that the CLL‐related immunodeficiency might be beneficial in the outcome of the COVID‐19 and deserved further investigation. No specific serological testing information was provided. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) has published recommendations on the prevention of COVID‐19 in patients with CLL but again not on serological investigations.

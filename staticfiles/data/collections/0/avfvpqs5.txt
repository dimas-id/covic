PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The transplant community continues to look for ways to help address the discordance between donor liver graft availability and patients on the liver transplant waiting list. Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor livers represents one potential means to help address this discordance. The present review describes the changing landscape of DCD liver transplantation (LT). RECENT FINDINGS: The number of DCD LTs performed annually within the USA has continued to grow on an annual basis. Importantly, national data has demonstrated that outcomes with DCD LT have been improving. This improvement has been driven by better understanding of how to successfully utilize these organs through better donor and recipient matching and careful evaluation of both hemodynamics during withdrawal of life support and the refinement of the procurement operation. SUMMARY: Despite these improvements in outcome, ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) continues to be the Achilles heel of DCD LT. Emerging technologies such as various forms of machine perfusion may allow for reduction of complications and better prognostication of the risk associated with DCD liver grafts.

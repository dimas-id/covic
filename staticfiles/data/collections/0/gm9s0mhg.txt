Heel ulcers are a costly and preventable complication of lower-extremity immobilization, but they still occur with some regularity. A technique using a short leg posterior splint that suspends the heel away from the splint is described. This modification completely removes pressure the heel to prevent decubitus ulcer formation. This technique is simple, inexpensive, and effective.

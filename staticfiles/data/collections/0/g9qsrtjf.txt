Abstract Providing scheduled consultations to persons with diabetes during the COVID-19 induced lockdowns posed a major challenge. With the clinicians occupied in COVID management, a strategy of using telemedicine and engaging a team of para-clinical doctors was devised. Telephonic follow up consults were given and diabetes care was efficiently delivered.

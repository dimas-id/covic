Zhejiang Province achieved one of the best records in containing the COVID‐19 pandemic in China, what lessons can the world learn from it? What roles do community‐based organizations play in its success story? Based on more than 100 interviews during and after the outbreak in Zhejiang, this article provides a roadmap of how community‐based organizations were involved in the three distinct stages of Zhejiang's responses to COVID‐19. We recommend that public sector leaders strategically leverage the strengths of community‐based organizations in multiple stages of COVID‐19 responses; incentivize volunteers to participate in epidemic prevention and control; provide data infrastructure and digital tracking platforms; and build trust and long‐term capacity of community‐based organizations.

Samples of eggs, newly hatched larvae (NHL), and larvae at the end of the lecithotrophic period (eight days after hatching) (LPL) of Lophiosilurus alexandri were collected to determine the amino acid and fatty acid profiles. Crude protein did not change throughout initial development and the concentration of lipids was highest in NHL. The content of the indispensable amino acids (IAA) isoleucine, leucine, and valine decreased in LPL, while in eggs and NHL they remained high and similar in value. The dispensable amino acids (DAA), such as aspartic acid, tyrosine, and glycine, increased in LPL, while alanine decreased. The percentage of neutral lipids increased in LPL. The saturated fatty acid content decreased during ontogeny, while monounsaturated fatty acids decreased only in LPL. The polyunsaturated fatty acid content was highest in LP. Polar fatty acids were found in higher percentages in eggs and NHL, but lower in LPL. Saturated fatty acid content decreased during ontogenetic development, while that of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased only in LPL. Polyunsaturated fatty acid content was highest in LPL. Protein content was maintained during ontogenetic development, while amino acid classes experienced changes. Lophiosilurus alexandri preferentially uses saturated and monosaturated fatty acids as an energy source during its early development.(AU)

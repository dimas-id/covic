PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic two-port totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A 10-year retrospective analysis from 2004 to 2013 of patients undergoing two-port TEP performed by a single surgeon at three surgical centers. RESULTS 336 consecutive patients underwent two-port TEP repairing 478 hernias. 315 (93.8 %) patients were male and 21 (6.2 %) were female. Mean age ± SD was 47 ± 14 years and mean body mass index ± SD was 28.0 ± 4.7 kg/m(2). Indications for surgery included primary repair 303 (90.2 %), recurrence from open repair 28 (8.3 %), and incarcerated inguinal hernia 5 (1.5 %). 194 (57.7 %) cases were unilateral and 142 (42.3 %) were bilateral. Operative time ± SD was 38.7 ± 14.9 min for unilateral repair and 43.4 ± 17.6 min for bilateral repair. Two-port TEP was successful in 316 (94.0 %). 20 (6.0 %) cases required the addition of a third port. 2 (0.6 %) cases were converted to open repair. Mean follow-up time ± SD was 5.4 ± 2.7 years. Postoperative complications included urinary retention 5 (1.5 %), seroma 7 (2.1 %), hematoma 1 (0.3 %), surgical site infection 4 (1.2 %), and chronic inguinal pain 3 (0.9 %). 11 (2.3 %) hernias recurred. CONCLUSION Two-port TEP appears to be a feasible, safe, and effective method for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and should be considered a viable, less invasive alternative to conventional three-port techniques.

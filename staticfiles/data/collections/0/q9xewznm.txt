PURPOSE/BACKGROUND In 2017, an estimated 39 910 people will receive a new diagnosis of rectal cancer. Current surgical guidelines limit transanal excision of early rectal neoplasia to 8 cm from the anal verge. We report that R0 resection of higher rectal cancers is possible using transanal robotic microsurgery. METHODS/INTERVENTIONS Ten cases of robotic assisted transanal surgery for early stage disease (T0-T1, N0) between 2013 and 2016 were reviewed. RESULTS/OUTCOMES All cases were diagnosed preoperatively with colonoscopy, and the average distance from the anal verge was 11.1 cm. The average operative time was 167 minutes, and the average blood loss was 37.5 cc. Four cases required intraoperative conversion; one conversion required robotic abdominal access to repair a proctotomy. All margins were histologically negative, and 6-month follow-up showed no recurrences. CONCLUSION/DISCUSSION Transanal robotic surgery may provide the colorectal surgeon a method to address rectal lesions farther from the anal verge.

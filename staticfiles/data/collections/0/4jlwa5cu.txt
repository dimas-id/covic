A new epidemic model for Covid-19 has been constructed and simulated for eight US states. The coefficients for this model, based on seven coupled differential equations, are carefully evaluated against recorded data on cases and deaths. These projections reveal that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than two years. If stay-at-home orders are relaxed, most states may experience a secondary peak in 2021. The number of Covid-19 deaths could have been significantly lower in most states that opened up, if lockdowns had been maintained. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current $\sim$ 15%) will eradicate infections in Texas within a year. Applied to the entire US, the predictions based on the current situation indicate about 11 million total infections (including undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed cases, and 630,000 cumulative deaths by November 1, 2020.

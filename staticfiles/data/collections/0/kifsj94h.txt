Despite measures such as travel restrictions and lockdowns, the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) is projected to spread across India. Considering that a vaccine for COVID-19 is expected to take at least a year to become widely available, it is important to identify populations with the highest risk from COVID-19 and take measures to prevent incident cases and build healthcare infrastructure at the local level. We used data from two large nationally representative household surveys, administrative sources, and published studies to estimate the risk of COVID-19 at the district level in India. We employed principal component analysis to create a composite index of the health risk of COVID-19 from demographic and comorbidity indicators such at the proportion of elderly population and rates of diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory illnesses. We created another principal component index of the socioeconomic and healthcare access risk from COVID-19, based on the standard of living, proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and per capita access to public healthcare in each district. We found that districts in northern, southern and western Indian states such as Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Maharashtra were at the highest health risk from COVID-19. Many of these districts have already been designated as COVID-19 hotspots by the Indian government because of emergent outbreaks. Districts in eastern and central states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh have higher socioeconomic and healthcare access risk as compared with other areas.

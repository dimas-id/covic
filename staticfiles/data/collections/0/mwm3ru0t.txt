Diabetes is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During this pandemic, many hospitals have already become overwhelmed around the world and are rapidly entering crisis mode. While there are global efforts to boost personal protective equipment (PPE) production, many centers are improvising care strategies, including the implementation of technology to prevent healthcare workers' exposures and reduce the waste of invaluable PPE. Not optimizing glycemic control due to clinical inertia driven by fear or lack of supplies may lead to poor outcomes in patients with diabetes and COVID-19. Individualized care strategies, novel therapeutic regimens, and the use of diabetes technology may reduce these barriers. However, systematic evaluation of these changes in care is necessary to evaluate both patient- and community-centered outcomes.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs, and the N-terminal domain of TGEV spike protein is generally recognized as both the virulence determinant and enteric tropism determinant. Here, we assembled a full-length infectious cDNA clone of TGEV in a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using a novel approach, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems efficiently and rapidly rescued another recombinant virus with a 224-amino-acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the TGEV Spike gene (S_NTD224), which is analogous to the N-terminal domain of porcine respiratory coronavirus. S_NTD224 notably affected the TGEV growth kinetics in PK-15 cells but was not essential for recombinant virus survival. In animal experiments with 13 two-day-old piglets, the TGEV recombinant viruses with/without S_NTD224 deletion induced obvious clinical signs and mortality. Together, our results directly demonstrated that S_NTD224 of TGEV mildly influenced TGEV virulence but was not the enteric tropism determinant and provide new insights for the development of a new attenuated vaccine against TGEV. Importantly, the optimized reverse genetics platform used in this study will simplify the construction of mutant infectious clones and help accelerate progress in coronavirus research.

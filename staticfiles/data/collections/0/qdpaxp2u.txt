PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to demonstrate our initial experience with and the feasibility of laparoendoscopic single-site retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (LESS-RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS 54 patients undergoing conventional retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy were compared with 27 patients undergoing LESS-RA. The adrenal tumors were considered to be benign preoperatively and <6 cm. Age, sex, laterality, body mass index, surgical indications, time to resuming oral intake, tumor size, operation time, estimated blood loss, intravenous or intramuscular analgesics (pethidine) and postoperative hospital stay were compared between the two groups. Analysis of covariance was applied to analyze postoperative hospital stay and time to resuming oral intake. RESULTS The length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly higher in the conventional retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy group in the adjusted and unadjusted model. The time to resuming oral intake was significant shorter in the LESS-RA group, but was not significant after adjusting opioid analgesics dosage. No conversions to an open or conventional retroperitoneoscopic approach were necessary. There were neither complications nor blood transfusions in both groups. CONCLUSIONS LESS-RA for benign adrenal tumors is a feasible surgical procedure when tumors are <6 cm. Further clinical research is warranted to define the role of LESS in adrenal surgery and to prove its efficacy over conventional laparoscopic surgery.

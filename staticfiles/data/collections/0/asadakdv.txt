As a 3rd year medical student who was on the inpatient medicine wards when the pandemic broke out, my life is jarringly discontinuous with what it was before. While I know many students have returned to their education in some form online, there is no replacement educational experience for being on the wards. One week I was waking up before sunrise to pre-round on patients, managing aspiration pneumonia and alcohol withdrawal, and feeling like a member of the medical team. The next week, I was at home in my pajamas, wishing my team good luck and hoping for some kind of news, some kind of certainty.

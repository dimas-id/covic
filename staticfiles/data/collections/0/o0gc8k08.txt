Abstract In spite of deep concerns about the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia, the 5th International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors at Nara was well attended with 442 presentations (24 countries; 60% from overseas), lively rump sessions and active participation by key figures including Professor Akasaki, the Honorary Chairman of the Conference ). Sponsored by the Japan Society of Applied Physics with co-sponsorship by the 162nd Committee on Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Photonic and Electronic Devices of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, technical sessions focused on topics ranging from growth and material characterisation to fabrication and commercialisation of devices such as high power FETs and laser diodes. This is a review of talks related to high power devices, AlGaN/GaN FETs, that have recently been the focus of intense scrutiny and may replace GaAs technology in the future.

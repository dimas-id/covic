Cutaneous manifestation is a newly reported clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The clinical description of cutaneous manifestation is still not fully described. Our patient, a medical person, had viral exanthem distributed in the extremities along with a "Spins and needles sensation," which differs from a previously published paper on cutaneous manifestations. The differential diagnosis of drug-induced skin rash and hand-foot-mouth disease was ruled out based on the patient's previous history and course of the disease.

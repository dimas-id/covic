Laparoscopic low anterior resection (LAR) with sphincter preservation for ultra-low rectal cancer is always a challenging operation in colorectal surgery. To achieve negative margins, reducing the difficulty and risks of the procedure are major goals for us. The marker meeting approach we reported can help to accomplish this goal. The key technique for the marker meeting approach is to ensure a clear distal margin in a low resection of the rectum by transanal dissection. This procedure allows access to the space around the distal rectum and mesorectum and to pack the gauzes in the distal part of the space as a landmark. Routine laparoscopic LAR was performed to dissect the space until reaching the gauzes packed above and achieve complete mobilization of the rectum and mesorectum. This surgical procedure is simpler and reduces the difficulty of the operation. Therefore, it is expected to reduce the risk of surgery-related complications and positive margins and is suitable to be widely applied and extended in clinical practice. The short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of the marker meeting approach need more research in large samples.

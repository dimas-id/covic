Abstract Epidemic of COVID-19 has spread over the world. We confirmed 6 Muslim pilgrims with COVID-19 among the passages of a flight from Pakistan after border inspection in Guangzhou, China. We alerted the home countries to early prepare for the risk among the returning pilgrims. And the strategies of inspection and quarantine should cover those from all the Muslim countries, but not limited to Saudi Arabia.

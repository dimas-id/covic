Animal behavior analysis is a crucial task for the industrial farming. In an indoor farm setting, extracting Key joints of animals is essential for tracking the animal for a longer period of time. In this paper, we proposed a deep network that exploits transfer learning to train the network for the pig skeleton extraction in an end to end fashion. The backbone of the architecture is based on an hourglass stacked dense-net. In order to train the network, keyframes are selected from the test data using K-mean sampler. In total, 9 Keypoints are annotated that gives a brief detailed behavior analysis in the farm setting. Extensive experiments are conducted and the quantitative results show that the network has the potential of increasing the tracking performance by a substantial margin.

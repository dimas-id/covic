Coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection endemic in the southwestern United States, can cause life-threatening infections in immunosuppressed patients. We report the contrasting cases of two adolescents with lupus nephritis, treated with intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide and daily oral corticosteroids, who developed pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. One patient developed a fatal form of fulminant disseminated coccidioidomycosis, while the other patient developed a solitary pulmonary Coccidioides immitis abscess which was responsive to intravenous liposomal amphotericin and fluconazole therapy. Because serologies and initial X-ray studies can be negative, definitive diagnostic studies including bronchioaveolar lavage and needle aspiration should be performed when there is clinical suspicion of coccidioidomycosis in an immunocompromised patient. Immunosuppressed patients with coccidioidomycosis should receive early intravenous amphotericin therapy and may benefit from long-term suppressive antifungal therapy to prevent relapse.

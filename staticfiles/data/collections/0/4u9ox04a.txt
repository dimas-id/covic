Fournier's gangrene is an acute bacterial infection producing necrosis of the perineum and external genitalia that generally affects elderly men. Although skin grafts and flaps are the standard procedure for reconstruction, sometimes wounds can become chronic. Rigenera Protocol is a new technique based on autologous skin micrografts that reactivates and supports wound healing. A 40-year-old male with Fournier's gangrene, due to a rectal microperforation following diarrhoea, was treated with surgical debridement, negative pressure wound therapy and subsequently coverage with skin grafts. He developed non-healing wounds treated by Rigenera protocol after two months of advanced wound dressings. This technique is based on skin micrografts obtained by mechanical dermal disgregation to provide mesenchymal stem cells and extracellular matrix to the wound. The suspension injected into the wound triggers reactivation of healing without significant residual scarring on both donor site and treated area. Non-healing wounds were reduced by 15% at day 7 and by 50% after 30 days. Wounds completely healed after seventy days. The regenerated tissue appeared closer to skin graft than to scar tissue. This report shows how the use of skin micrografts through Rigenera protocol can be a useful method to reactivate wound healing resulting from Fournier's gangrene, with no discomfort for patient in a practical, safe and easy way.

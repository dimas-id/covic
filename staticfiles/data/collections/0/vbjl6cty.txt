Although surgical outcomes of totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) have been reported from several centers, the effectiveness of this technique has not been conclusively established. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TLTG for gastric cancer.A prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed data were used by comparing the short-term surgical outcomes of 124 patients who underwent TLTG with those of 124 patients who underwent open total gastrectomy (OTG) between March 2007 and March 2016.The 2 groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, body mass index, ASA score, and tumor stage. There was no significant difference with regard to the operation time but TLTG showed significantly less intraoperative blood loss (115.5 ± 70.2 vs 210.5 ± 146.7 mL, P < .01). Total numbers of retrieved lymph nodes were similar in the 2 groups. Postoperatively, no significant differences were found for morbidity or mortality. The time to first flatus, initiate oral intake, and postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter in the TLTG group than in the OTG group (3.2 ± 1.0 vs 4.1 ± 1.2 days; 4.4 ± 1.2 vs 5.6 ± 2.0 days; and 8.9 ± 3.1 vs 11.3 ± 4.5 days, respectively; P < .01).TLTG for gastric cancer is technically safe, feasible, and minimally invasive compared with OTG. A prospective randomized trial is needed to establish the value of TLTG.

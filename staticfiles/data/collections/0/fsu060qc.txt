The World´s Heath Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 a pandemic in March 11 2020. The first data about the disease clinical features were reported from Wuhan China the epicenter of the outbreak; aside from the respiratory involvement, gastrointestinal manifestations have been described. Even though the exact mechanism for the new coronavirus tropism for the gastrointestinal tract is not well understood, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor seems to play an important role as the entry site for the virus, since it is widespread located throughout the enteric mucosa. Fecal oral transmission is a possible contagion route, regardless of the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the virus has been isolated from feces even 7-12 days after a negative pharyngeal swab. COVID’s-19 gastrointestinal involvement is not an infrequent event, data reports patients who present with these symptoms have worst prognosis. Knowing the possible gastrointestinal manifestations might rise our clinical suspicion in order to establish earlier and timely diagnosis.

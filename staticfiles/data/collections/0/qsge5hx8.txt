In the first part of this dual commentary, perspectives are gathered from students at New York University. COVID in New York City is compared with the trauma of the World Trade Center. Triggers, racism, concerns, acts of kindness, and the future are considered for both. The second part of the commentary is written in juxtaposition to the New York City perspective by sharing the Upper Midwest experiences of this COVID-19 pandemic period, particularly in the small city of Duluth. Perspectives are gathered over time from students at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. The Minnesota stories are presented chronologically, from the declaration of the global pandemic to the beginning of the summer semester. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is treated with anticoagulation therapy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), angioplasty, and liver transplantation. TIPS is not always technically feasible, due to the complete hepatic venous thrombosis. Direct intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (DIPS) is an alternative method for decompression of portal hypertension. This is a retrospective, single-center study aiming to evaluate the outcome of ultrasound (US)-guided DIPS in patients with BCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2016, six patients with BCS were treated with US-guided DIPS. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stents were used in two patients and bare-metal stents in four patients. Mean follow-up time was 71.4 months (range: 21-164). Technical/clinical success, technical difficulties, and complications of DIPS were analyzed. RESULTS Technical success without complications was achieved in all patients (100%). In one patient, DIPS was performed through the right femoral vein, without significant amelioration of portal hypertension (clinical success 83.3%). In four out of five patients, ascites and variceal bleeding resolved completely and in the other one ascites was relieved. Six- and 12-month primary patency rates were 100% in PTFE-covered stent group when compared with bare-metal stent group, the rates were 33% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION US-guided DIPS is a safe and effective alternative technique for patients with BCS, with significant clinical improvement.

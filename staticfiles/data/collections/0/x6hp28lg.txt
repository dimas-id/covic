Urogenital lesions are relatively common in ferrets. Renal disease is diagnosed as in traditional small animal medicine; however, peculiarities in ferrets include physiologically low levels of creatinine. Renal cysts are very common in ferrets but are usually incidental findings. Uroliths are usually composed of struvite or cystine. Urethral obstruction in male ferrets is predominantly caused by adrenal-associated prostatic disease. Spontaneous cystitis is rare in ferrets. Primary reproductive disease is uncommon in ferrets in the United States where animals are usually neutered at 6 weeks of age. In other countries, ferrets either remain unneutered or are neutered at 5 to 6 months of age. Ferrets are seasonal breeders, and female are induced ovulators. Prolonged estrus and hyperestrogenism often causes profound bone marrow suppression.

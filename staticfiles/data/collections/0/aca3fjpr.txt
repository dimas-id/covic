Influenza C virus spike glycoprotein HEF specifically recognizes glycoconjugates containing 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid. The same protein also contains an esterase activity. Taking advantage of these two properties, influenza C virus was used as a very sensitive probe for the detection of traces of 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid in human leucocytes. The binding of influenza C virus to leucocyte glycoproteins and gangliosides separated by sodium dodecyl sulphateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and thin-layer chromatography, respectively, was assayed using a chromogenic esterase substrate. In this way, glycoproteins of B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes were found to contain 9-O-acetylated sialic acids. Of the various 9-O-acetylated gangliosides detected, one had the characteristics of 9-O-acetylated G(D3). The identification of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on distinct glycoproteins and glycolipids should be helpful in assigning a physiological role to this sugar.

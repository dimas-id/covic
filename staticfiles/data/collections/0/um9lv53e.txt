Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 and has since become a global pandemic. Pathogen-specific antibodies are typically a major predictor of protective immunity, yet B cell and antibody responses during COVID-19 are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and antibody responses in twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19, and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific ASCs in all twenty COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot assay. Out of the 20 patients, 16 had developed SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by the time of inclusion in the study. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibody levels positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels may reflect the titers of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of infection. Lastly, we showed that interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were higher in serum of patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting the recent observations that IL-6 and CRP could be used to predict COVID-19 severity. Altogether, this study constitutes a detailed description of clinical and immunological parameters in twenty COVID-19 patients, with a focus on B cell and antibody responses, and provides tools to study immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination.

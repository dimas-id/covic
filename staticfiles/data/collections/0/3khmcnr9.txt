Adjuvants are added to vaccines to increase their potency. In general they do this by stimulating innate immune responses. They can be classified into damage-associated molecular patterns-type adjuvants that act by killing cells so that their released products trigger inflammation. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns-type adjuvants contain microbial molecules that trigger inflammation and dendritic cell maturation through pattern recognition receptors. A third type of adjuvant consists of nanoparticles or emulsions optimized to deliver antigen efficiently to dendritic cells or alternatively to prolong the release of antigen into the body. Different types of adjuvants may be combined to maximize their effect.

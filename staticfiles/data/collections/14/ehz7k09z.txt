Acute respiratory distress syndrome and coagulopathy played an important role in morbidity and mortality of severe COVID‐19 patients. A higher frequency of PE than expected in COVID‐19 patients was recently reported. The presenting symptoms for PE were untypical including dyspnea, which is one of the major symptoms in severe COVID‐19, especially in those patients with ARDS. We reported two COVID‐19 cases with coexisting complications of PE and ARDS, aiming to consolidate the emerging knowledge of this global health emergency and raise the awareness that the hypoxemia or severe dyspnea in COVID‐19 may be related to PE and not necessarily always due to the parenchymal disease.

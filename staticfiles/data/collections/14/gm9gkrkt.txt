Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2) has a high homology with other cousin of coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS). After outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in China, it has spread so fast around the world. The main complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is respiratory failure, but several patients have also been admitted to the hospital with neurological symptoms. Direct invasion, hematogenic rout, retrograde and anterograde transport along peripheral nerves are considered as main neuroinvasion mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we describe the possible routes for entering of SARS-CoV-2 into the nervous system. Then, neurological manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) are reviewed. Furthermore, the neuropathology of the virus and its impacts on other neurological disorders are discussed.

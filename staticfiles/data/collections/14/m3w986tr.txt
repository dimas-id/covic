The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated itself to be a considerable stressor, especially for those individuals coping with a preexisting mental health disorder. This article contains clinical observations and reflections from two practicing psychologists regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social conditions on clients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Observations include changes in trauma-related symptom manifestations and therapeutic process issues, particularly in response to social isolation. The authors encourage specific therapeutic considerations and offer suggestions for adapting treatment with regard to these early observations.

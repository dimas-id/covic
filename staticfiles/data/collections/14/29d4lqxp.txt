Half century ago, a few academic pioneers founded the laboratories of experimental and ultrastructural pathology in Ancona. From this origin, a new phase of experimental studies developed aimed at translational and clinical research up to the present, when our group is internationally recognized for its fundamental contributions in gerontological research and molecular diagnostic pathology. Since the desire of immortality and of eternal youth seems to be as old as mankind, in the future we plan to focus our scientific research on Regenerative Medicine and Rejuvenation strategies. This is the most ambitious aim in the framework of the world aging population. We do not know whether we would achieve these results by ourselves. We are confident that, as in the past, new generations of scientist of the school of experimental pathology at Ancona will get the baton by the older one and lead the future with the same enthusiasm, love and commitment.

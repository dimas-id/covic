Nasopharyngeal (NP), nasal and throat swabs are the most practical specimen sources to test for upper respiratory pathogens. We compared the sensitivity of NP, nasal and throat swabs to detect SARS-CoV-2 in community patients. Using detection at any site as the standard, the sensitivities were 90%, 80% and 87% for NP, nasal and throat respectively (n=30 positive at any site). Throat swabs are likely a suitable alternative to NP swabs for the detection of COVID-19 infections.

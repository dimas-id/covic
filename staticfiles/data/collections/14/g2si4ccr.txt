AIM The quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a crucial determinant of outcome following cardiac arrest. Interruptions in chest compressions are detrimental. We aimed to compare the effect of mouth-to-mouth ventilation (MMV), mouth-to-pocket mask ventilation (MPV) and bag-valve-mask ventilation (BMV) on the quality of CPR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surf lifeguards in active service were included in the study. Each surf lifeguard was randomized to perform three sessions of single-rescuer CPR using each of the three ventilation techniques (MMV, MPV and BMV) separated by 5 min of rest. Data were obtained from a resuscitation manikin and video recordings. RESULTS A total of 60 surf lifeguards were included (67% male, 33% female, mean age 25 years). Interruptions in chest compressions were significantly reduced by MMV (8.9 ± 1.6 s) when compared to MPV (10.7 ± 3.0 s, P < 0.001) and BMV (12.5 ± 3.5s, P < 0.001). Significantly more effective ventilations (visible chest rise) were delivered using MMV (91%) when compared to MPV (79%, P < 0.001) and BMV (59%, P < 0.001). The inspiratory time was longer during MMV (0.7 ± 0.2 s) and MPV (0.7 ± 0.2s, P < 0.001 for both) compared to BMV (0.5 ± 0.2s). Tidal volumes were significantly lower using BMV (0.4 ± 0.2L) compared to MMV (0.6 ± 0.2L, P < 0.001) and MPV (0.6 ± 0.3 L, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were observed when comparing MMV and MPV. CONCLUSION MMV reduces interruptions in chest compressions and produces a higher proportion of effective ventilations during lifeguard CPR. This suggests that CPR quality is improved using MMV compared to MPV and BMV.

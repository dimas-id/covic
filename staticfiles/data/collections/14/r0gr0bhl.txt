COVID-19 is a newly communicable disease with a catastrophe outbreak that affects all over the world. We retrieved about 8,781 nucleotide fragments and complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 reported from sixty-four countries. The CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), GISAID, and NCBI Genbank. All the sequences were aligned against reference genomes using Clustal Omega and variants were called using in-house built Python script. We intend to establish a user-friendly online resource to visualize the variants in the viral genome along with the Primer Infopedia. After analyzing and filtering the data globally, it was made available to the public. The detail of data available to the public includes mutations from 5688 SARS-CoV-2 sequences curated from 91 regions. This database incorporated 39920 mutations over 3990 unique positions. According to the translational impact, these mutations include 11829 synonymous mutations including 681 synonymous frameshifts and 21701 nonsynonymous mutations including 10 nonsynonymous frameshifts. Development of SARS-CoV-2 mutation genome browsers is a fundamental step obliging towards the virus surveillance, viral detection, and development of vaccine and therapeutic drugs.

PURPOSE Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has become the standard operative approach for splenectomy. Portal or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) is a serious and common complication after LS, and lethal complications of PSVT can occur when the portal vein is completely occluded by portal vein thrombosis (PVT). We aimed to clarify the predictors of PSVT after LS and to determine which of them were also predictors of PVT. METHODS A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent elective LS were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of PSVT after LS. In addition, patients with PSVT were divided into two groups: a PVT group and a non-PVT group. The preoperative and intraoperative clinical data were compared among the groups. RESULTS Thirty (53.6%) patients developed PSVT. The splenic vein diameter was the most useful predictor for the development of PSVT, and 10 mm was an accurate splenic vein diameter cut-off value for use as a predictive factor for PSVT. In addition, the splenic vein diameter was the most useful predictor of the development of PVT from splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), and 14 mm was found to be an accurate cut-off value. CONCLUSION PSVT is a common postoperative complication that is identified on enhanced computed tomography. The splenic vein diameter is not only a predictor of PSVT but also of the development of PVT from SVT.

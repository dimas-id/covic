Abstract The respiratory system has two principal purposes – to maintain adequate arterial Pao2, and to regulate arterial Paco2 and thereby maintain a stable acid-base state. Both are necessary to sustain normal tissue metabolism. Respiratory failure can be defined in two ways: • failure of oxygenation, resulting in Pao2 < 8.0 kPa • failure of ventilation, resulting in Paco2 > 6.7 kPa with accompanying acid-base changes.

Interventional radiology serves a key role in the management of these patients. The interventionist should be knowledgeable of the clinical presentation as well as key imaging findings, which often dictate the approach to treatment. This article concisely reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation of BCS and provides a detailed description of imaging and treatment options, particularly interventional management.

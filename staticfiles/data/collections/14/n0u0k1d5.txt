INTRODUCTION Premalignant lesions of the foregut (esophagus and stomach) are common entities usually incidentally identified on either endoscopic or radiographic imaging studies. SYMPTOMS These lesions are often asymptomatic or associated with vague gastrointestinal symptoms. TREATMENT Current management of benign and premalignant lesions of the foregut includes primarily ablative and resective endoscopic techniques as well as thoracoscopic, laparoscopic, and open surgical techniques of enucleation and segmental resections. The appropriate procedure, however, is based on the depth of penetration, lesion location, and suspicion for underlying malignant potential.

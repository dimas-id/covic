The past 30 years has witnessed a dramatic re-emergence of epidemic vector-borne diseases throughout much of the world. Factors contributing to this are many, but the principal drivers have been complacency and de-emphasis of infectious diseases in pubic health policy, increased population growth, uncontrolled urbanization without concomitant attention to water and waste management, increased globalization and the ease with which modern air transport can quickly spread pathogens and their vectors. The re-emergence of parasitic, bacterial and viral vector-borne pathogens is described. This re-emergence increases the current and future need for preventative measures to contain disease outbreaks and for international cooperation and collaboration to constantly monitor the outbreak of these debilitating and deadly diseases.

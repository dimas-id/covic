Abstract BACKGROUND: Established systems for education and rapid dissemination of information are essential to a healthcare facility's ability to respond to emerging public health threats. We assessed the education activities and communication resources available for this purpose in a representative sample of U.S. hospitals. METHODS: We selected a 20% (n=1236) random sample of hospitals from the 2000 American Hospital Association database, stratified by bed size, service, metropolitan statistical sampling area (MSSA), and region to ensure representativeness. Infection control professionals (ICPs) at the hospitals were asked to complete a Web-based questionnaire during October 21â€“December 22, 2003. RESULTS: ICPs at 556 (45%) hospitals completed the survey, including 518 (93%) general medical-surgical, 20 (4%) other specialty (including oncology), and 18 (3%) children's hospitals; 352 (63%) were in urban (<100,000 population) areas and 224 (40%) had <100 beds. Most hospitals had provided educational programs about infection control issues related to smallpox (87%), smallpox vaccine-related adverse events (76%), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (75%); and anthrax (73%). Fewer offered programs on monkeypox (27%). Hospitals reported that the best ways to disseminate information to them were via e-mail (97%), Web sites or group e-mail lists (72%), videoconference (40%), or teleconference (35%). Urban hospitals were more likely than rural to identify Web sites (p=0.001) and videoconference (p=0.03) as the best ways to receive information. Hospitals used e-mail (94%), teleconferencing (72%), Web-based training (61%), computer-based tools (50%), and videoconferencing (46%) to reach hospital-based clinical personnel. Urban hospitals were more likely than rural to use e-mail (p=0.01) to reach personnel. Hospitals identified model preparedness plans (61%), educational materials for personnel (54%) or patients/public (40%), and tabletop exercises/drills (46%) as being most helpful to preparedness efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals may differ substantially in preparedness and response readiness. These findings will assist in determining the best strategies for communicating with hospitals and providing information to assist them in preparedness efforts.

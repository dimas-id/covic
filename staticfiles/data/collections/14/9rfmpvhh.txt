Potentially pandemic strains of influenza pose an undeniable threat to human populations. Therefore, it is essential to develop better strategies to enhance vaccine design and predict parameters that identify susceptible humans. CD4 T cells are a central component of protective immunity to influenza, delivering direct effector function and potentiating responses of other lymphoid cells. Humans have highly diverse influenza-specific CD4 T-cell populations that vary in stimulation history, specificity, and functionality. These complexities constitute a formidable obstacle to predicting immune responses to pandemic strains of influenza and derivation of optimal vaccine strategies. We suggest that more precise efforts to identify and enumerate both the positive and negative contributors of immunity in the CD4 T-cell compartment will aid in both predicting susceptible hosts and in development of vaccination strategies that will poise most human subjects to respond to pandemic influenza strains with protective immune responses.

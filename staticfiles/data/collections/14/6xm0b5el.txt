Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. All stages of their replication cycle depend on support by host-encoded factors. However, sequence variation also exists in host factors mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Several coding and non-coding genetic variants in the PPIA gene encoding for CypA have been described, but there is only limited information about their influence on the course of viral infection. This paper reviews PPIA polymorphisms and what is known about their impact on the replication cycle and course of disease for different viral infections.

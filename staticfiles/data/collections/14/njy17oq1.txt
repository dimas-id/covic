Data has shown that intense impact events such as large magnitude earthquakes and the US terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have shown us that unforeseen catastrophic events are followed by a significant increase of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). We are concerned that similarly, the recent COVID-19 pandemia that not only has dismantled our way of living, in a matter of weeks, but also has challenged all of us beyond our abilities might be also related to an increase in prevalence of VA and SCD. In addition to such provocative suggestions raise in this article we want to convey the message that we must remain vigilant long after we have silenced COVID-19.

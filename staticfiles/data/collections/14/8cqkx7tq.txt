BACKGROUND/AIM Nowadays, obtaining optimal surgical margin of the resected metastasis and the parenchyma- sparing surgical technique are a great challenge for hepatic surgeons. The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the prognostic value of the surgical margin and the parenchyma- sparing liver resection technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the data of 319 patients [123 (36.6%) female and 196 (61.4%) male] who had colorectal cancer and underwent surgery to treat colorectal liver metastases in our Department between 2005 and 2014. RESULTS The most commonly used resection type was the non-anatomic resection (43%). Multivariate analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in survival (p=0.473) between the microscopically-negative (R0) and microscopically-positive (R1) resections, as well as between the resection types (p=0.257). CONCLUSION Parenchymal-sparing non-anatomic resection and spray diathermy on the resection surface of the liver should be applied not only for hemostasis, but also to destroy the area containing possible tumor cells after an R1 resection and not to have worse survival outcomes.

Abstract Background Pertussis, is an infectious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. The incidence of pertussis has been increasing in South Korea to due to waning vaccine-induced immunity. Culture has a low sensitivity and a long turnaround time (TAT). Recently, a rapid multi-polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) test with a TAT of about 1 hour was developed for the detection of respiratory pathogens (17 viruses and three bacteria), including Bordetella pertussis. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mPCR for early diagnosis and treatment of pertussis. Methods We performed a retrospective study of patients with pertussis diagnosed from May 2017 to June 2019 at a university hospital in South Korea. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were tested using mPCR. Data were extracted from medical records. Results A total of 27 patients with a median age of 48.9 years (range: 3.3–82.2 years) were diagnosed with pertussis, of whom 9 (33.3%) were male. Eleven (40.7%) had fever, 12 (44.4%) had dyspnea, three (11.1%) had paroxysmal cough, and nine (33.3%) had inspiratory whooping. The median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 9.0 days (range: 1–31 days). Twenty-four patients (81.5%) were diagnosed within 2 weeks from symptom onset. All but one patient was prescribed macrolide antibiotics. Twenty-two patients (81.5%) required hospitalization, including three (11.1%) who required intensive care unit care for ventilation. Conclusion Testing patients with respiratory symptoms using mPCR can improve early diagnosis of pertussis, ensure proper treatment, and may help with outbreak control.

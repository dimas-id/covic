In contrast to conventional fluorescent polymers featured by large conjugation structures, a new class of fluorescent polymers without above conjugations are gaining constant interest owing to their significant academic importance and promising applications in diverse fields. These unconventional fluorescent polymers are in general composed of heteroatoms (e.g. N, O, P, and S) under different forms. Here we report our recent study on polyurea, prepared by a very simple one step precipitation polymerization of toluene diisocyanate in a binary solvent of water-acetone. This polyurea, basically consisting of phenyl ring and urea group, shows fluorescent emission in a broad concentration range, from very low (10(-5) mg/mL) to its solubility limit (50 mg/mL), and in a wide range of emission wavelength from UV to visible regions of up to 500 nm under varied excitation wavelength. The emission behaviors were fully studied under different concentrations and excitations. It was concluded that the emission in UV region was intrinsic due to the conjugation between the phenyl and the adjacent urea unit; while the emission in visible region, strongly excitation dependent, was caused by the cluster formation of the molecular chains, in accordance with the cluster-triggered-emission (CTE) mechanism. The formation of the cluster was tested through dynamic light scattering, FTIR and UV absorbance. Tested in presence of different metal ions, Fe(3+) demonstrated a quenching effect with high selectivity. Based on this study, different paper-based sensors were designed to detect Fe(3+), H(2)O(2) in bioanalysis and for data encryption. This work provides a simple way to prepare a polyurea, a novel type of unconventional fluorescent polymer, with high emission performance distinct from its known analogues.

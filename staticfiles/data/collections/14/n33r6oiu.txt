BACKGROUND Singapore reported its first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in early March 2003 and was placed on the World Health Organization's list of SARS-affected countries on March 15, 2003. During the outbreak, Tan Tock Seng Hospital was designated as the national SARS hospital in Singapore to manage all known SARS patients. Stringent infection control measures were introduced to protect healthcare workers and control intrahospital transmission of SARS. Work-flow processes for surgery were extensively modified. METHODS The authors describe the development of infection control measures, the conduct of surgical procedures, and the management of high-risk procedures during the SARS outbreak. RESULTS Forty-one operative procedures, including 15 high-risk procedures (surgical tracheostomy), were performed on SARS-related patients. One hundred twenty-four healthcare workers had direct contact with SARS patients during these procedures. There was no transmission of SARS within the operating room complex. CONCLUSIONS Staff personal protection, patient risk categorization, and reorganization of operating room workflow processes formed the key elements for the containment of SARS transmission. Lessons learned during this outbreak will help in the planning and execution of infection control measures, should another outbreak occur.

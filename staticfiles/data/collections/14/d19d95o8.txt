Abstract The SARS-CoV open reading frame 6 (ORF6) is transcribed into mRNA6 and encodes a putative 7.5kDa accessory protein, SARS 6, with unknown function. In this study, we have confirmed the SARS 6 protein expression in lung and intestine tissues of the SARS patients and in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells by immunohistochemistry. Further studies by immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses revealed the expression and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of the recombinant SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells. Expression of SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells elicits biological activity of stimulating cellular DNA synthesis.

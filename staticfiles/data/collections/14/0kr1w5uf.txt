BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) by retrospective comparison with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) in a local community hospital. METHODS SILC was introduced and performed in 57 patients for benign gallbladder diseases. Their clinical data were compared with those of 62 patients treated with CLC. They included patient demographic data and operative outcomes. RESULTS SILC was attempted in 57 patients and 52 cases (91.2%) were successfully completed. There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in terms of operative time, blood loss, and postoperative complications. The length of hospital stay in the SILC group was significantly shorter compared with CLC (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS SILC has been successfully introduced in a local community hospital. The safety and feasibility was also confirmed. The SILC procedure may become 1 standard option for the treatment of benign gallbladder diseases.

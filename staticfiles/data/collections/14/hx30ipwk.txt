Novel quinolines fused with a six‐member ring 5a–j were prepared in high yields (75–95%) via the Friedländer reaction of dimethoxy‐substituted o‐aminobenzaldehydes of 3a or 3b with cyclic ketones 4, respectively. The structures of 5a–j were determined by IR, (1)H NMR, MS, and elemental analysis. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A high-performance method was developed for protein secondary structure prediction based on the dual-layer support vector machine (SVM) and position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs). SVM is a new machine learning technology that has been successfully applied in solving problems in the field of bioinformatics. The SVM's performance is usually better than that of traditional machine learning approaches. The performance was further improved by combining PSSM profiles with the SVM analysis. The PSSMs were generated from PSI-BLAST profiles, which contain important evolution information. The final prediction results were generated from the second SVM layer output. On the CB513 data set, the three-state overall per-residue accuracy, Q3, reached 75.2%, while segment overlap (SOV) accuracy increased to 80.0%. On the CB396 data set, the Q3 of our method reached 74.0% and the SOV reached 78.1%. A web server utilizing the method has been constructed and is available at http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/pmsvm.

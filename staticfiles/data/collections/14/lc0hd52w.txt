A total of 138 horse blood samples were collected from 2012 to 2013 for the subsequent separation of serum collection. For detection of anti-Leishmania spp. and anti-Trypanosoma spp. antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence reactions and immunoenzymatic assays were performed. Samples with titers &#8805;40 were considered positive in the indirect immunofluorescence (IFAT), and the cut off for the enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) was calculated with three standard deviations. When tested for Trypanosoma spp., 50.37% (68/135) of the samples were ELISA reagents, 18.84% (8/136) were positive for IFAT and 2.89% (4/138) for both tests. A significant statistical association was observed for the municipality (p = 0.013) and collection period (p = 0.042) in the ELISA. When tested for Leishmania spp., 25.4% (35/138) of the samples were ELISA reagents, 13.00% (18/138) were positive for the IFAT and 4.34% (6/138) were positive for two tests, there were no variables associated with seropositivity. A statistical association (p = 0.0034) was observed between the presence of anti-Trypanosoma spp. and anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies when the ELISA was used. The results suggest that this horse breed is in contact with leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis, which demonstrates the need for a more accurate investigation into the real role of horses in these diseases to assist in disease control measures.(AU)

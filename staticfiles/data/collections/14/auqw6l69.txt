PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the evolution of 20 patients with H1N1 pneumonia, focusing our attention on patients with severe clinical and radiological findings who developed post-acute respiratory distress syndrome (post-ARDS) pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty adult patients (nine women and 11 men; mean age 43.5Â±16.4 years) with a diagnosis of H1N1 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab came to our attention from September to November 2009 and were followed up until September 2010. All patients were hospitalised in consideration of the severity of clinical findings, and all underwent chest X-ray. Twelve of them underwent at least one computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. RESULTS: In 75% of cases (15/20), there was complete resolution of the clinical and radiological findings. Twenty-five percent of patients (5/20) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which progressed to predominantly peripheral pulmonary fibrosis in 10% (2/20; one died and one had late-onset pulmonary fibrosis, documented on day 68). Moreover, in one patient with a CT diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, we observed progressive regression of radiological findings over 4 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with H1N1 pneumonia, post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis is not a rare complication. Therefore, a CT scan should be performed in all patients with severe clinical findings. Our study demonstrated that in these patients, fibrosis could present a different spatial distribution and a different temporal trend, with delayed late onset; moreover, in one case, the signs of interstitial lung disease partially regressed over time. Therefore, CT should be considered not only in the diagnostic stage, but also during the follow-up.

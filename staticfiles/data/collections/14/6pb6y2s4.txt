COVID-19 pandemic had made an unprecedented impact worldwide. India has entered into a total lockdown by invoking the special provision of Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2015. The complete lockdown policy has a direct and indirect impact on Homeless Persons with Mental Illness (HPMI) concerning shelter, basic needs and access to health care, besides the transmission of COVID infection.

INTRODUCTION Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital malformation found most frequently as intralobar sequestration in the left lower lobe. Complete surgical resection is considered the treatment of choice. PRESENTATION We present the case of a 29- year-old woman with intralobar pulmonary sequestration (ILS) diagnosed on chest CT. The sequestration was located in the left lower basal segments (segments 9 and 10) and was treated successfully by robot-assisted segmental resection without complication. DISCUSSION Recently, robot- assisted thoracoscopic lobar resections started to be performed for ILS. The sublobar, segmental resection are reserved mainly for the resection of pulmonary nodules. We report a first case of robot-assisted anatomical segmental resection for ILS. CONCLUSION We highlight the role of robotic technology offering three-dimensional view and excellent dexterity enhancing the surgical performance and getting the surgical procedure more precise and safer. This could be useful especially in case of challenging sublobar resections.

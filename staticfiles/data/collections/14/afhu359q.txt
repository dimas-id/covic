BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The hemodynamic factors of aneurysms were recently evaluated using computational fluid dynamics in a static vessel model in an effort to understand the mechanisms of initiation and rupture of aneurysms. However, few reports have evaluated the dynamic wall motion of aneurysms due to the cardiac cycle. The objective of this study was to quantify cardiac cycle-related volume changes in aneurysms using 4-dimensional CT angiography. METHODS Four-dimensional CT angiography was performed in 18 patients. Image data of 1 cardiac cycle were divided into 10 phases and the volume of the aneurysm was then quantified in each phase. These data were also compared with intracranial vessels of normal appearance. RESULTS The observed cardiac cycle-related volume changes were in good agreement with the sizes of the aneurysms and normal vessels. The cardiac cycle-related volume changes of the intracranial aneurysms and intracranial normal arteries were 5.40%±4.17% and 4.20±2.04%, respectively, but these did not differ statistically (P=0.12). CONCLUSIONS We successfully quantified the volume change in intracranial aneurysms and intracranial normal arteries in human subjects. The data may indicate that cardiac cycle-related volume changes do not differ between unruptured aneurysms and normal intracranial arteries, suggesting that the global integrity of an unruptured aneurysmal wall is not different from that of normal intracranial arteries.

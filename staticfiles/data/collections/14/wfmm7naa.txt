Rapid diagnosis of coronavirus disease COVID-19 is challenging in developing countries due to diverse clinical presentations and limited healthcare infrastructure. Biosensors hold immense prospects for diagnosis of the disease. Two approaches are proposed: the first involves measurement of host immune response and second, the detection of viruses or viral cell surface proteins using suitable bioreceptors. The article provides an overview of evanescent wave absorbance and localized surface plasmon resonance-based optic fiber platform for potential screening of COVID-19.

The coronavirus spike protein S is responsible for important biological activities including virus neutralization by antibody, cell attachment, and cell fusion. Recently, we have elucidated the amino acid sequence of an S determinant common in murine coronaviruses (W. Luytjes, D. Geerts, W. Posthumus, R. Meloen, and W. Spaan, J. Virol. 63:1408-1412, 1989). A monoclonal antibody directed to this determinant (MAb 5B19.2) protected mice against acute fatal infection. In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized with a synthetic peptide of 13 amino acids corresponding to the binding site of MAb 5B19.2, which was either extended with an amino acid sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin or conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both immunogens induced S-specific antibodies in mice, but only the hemagglutinin-peptide construct protected them against lethal challenge. In contrast to mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV-4), MHV-A59 was not neutralized in vitro by MAb 5B19.2. Neither MHV-A59 nor MHV-4 was neutralized in vitro by antibodies comprising by the synthetic peptides. Our results demonstrated that antibodies elicited with a synthetic peptide comprising a B-cell epitope and a T-helper cell determinant can protect mice against an acute fetal mouse hepatitis virus infection.

Abstract Teleproctoring can be used successfully in performing challenging and innovative structural heart interventions using sophisticated technology which allows real time bidirectional audiovisual communication with digital transmission of live videos and direct observation of the operative field by a remote proctor. We share an illustrative case that was performed amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic that led to travel restrictions to limit spread of the virus. Teleproctoring has future implications beyond the current global health crisis to facilitate rapid dissemination and exchange of knowledge for ultimately helping patients around the globe.

For the past 6 years, the Editorial Board and staff of Mayo Clinic Proceedings have dedicated ourselves to the progressive evolution of this journal. During this period, and for the foreseeable future, we have embraced change and improvement as themes for our daily efforts. As such, the changes identified in this communication are not a leap forward for the journal, they merely represent the next logical step in the growth of the journal. Given the momentum that has developed during the past few years, readers should expect to see further changes, all intended to better communicate with our principal readers, practicing physicians. In the final analysis, we are driven by a rededication of the journal to the primary value of Mayo Clinic: "The needs of the patient come first." While the journal's leadership has long looked to this statement for guidance, our approach to addressing this value in 2005 will require a considerable number of innovations. We look forward to sharing with you, our readers, these next steps in the journal's history. We trust that we will be able to learn and grow together so that, in the final analysis, the journal will build on its reputation as an authoritative and respected source of information.

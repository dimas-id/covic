T-cell lymphomas are rare and aggressive malignancies associated with poor outcome, often because of the development of resistance in the lymphoma against chemotherapy as well as intolerance in patients to the established and toxic chemotherapy regimens. In this review article, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, current standard of care, and future treatments of common types of T-cell lymphomas, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, aggressive NK/T-cell lymphoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

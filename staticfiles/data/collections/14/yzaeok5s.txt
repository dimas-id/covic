AIM The present study aimed to clarify the safety and feasibility of esophagojejunostomy during totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG). PATIENTS AND METHODS In 45 consecutive patients who underwent TLTG for gastric cancer, esophagojejunostomy was performed with a functional end-to-end anastomosis (FEEA) using a linear stapler in 24 patients or with a double stapling technique (DST) using a trans-orally inserted anvil (OrVilâ„¢) in 21 patients. RESULTS The DST was more likely to be chosen in patients with tumors located in the upper stomach. In the FEEA group, both the mean length of the operation and the mean postoperative hospital stay were significantly shorter compared to those in the DST group. Two patients in the FEEA group and four patients in the DST group developed postoperative complications but there were no postoperative deaths in either group. CONCLUSION Both FEEA and DST in esophagojejunostomy during TLTG are safe and feasible.

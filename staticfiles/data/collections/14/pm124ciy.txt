BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for severe respiratory infections and higher costs in medical care. The two aims of this work were to assess the performances of SOFIA(®)RSV tests in “real-life-laboratory” conditions (study 1) and implemented at point-of-care testing in a pediatric emergency department (ED, study 2), during two consecutive winter seasons. METHODS: In study 1, fresh nasopharyngeal swabs from patients of all ages were sampled in 1.5 ml of Universal virological Transport Medium (UTM) and prospectively tested using SOFIA(®)RSV tests. In study 2, conducted in a pediatric ED, nasopharyngeal swabs were placed in 3 ml of UTM. All SOFIA(®)RSV tests were confirmed by molecular testing, considered as reference method. The epidemiological and clinical features of tested patients, as well as the care of these patients after obtaining quick results were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivities of SOFIA(®)RSV in infants (aged under 24 months) performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED were respectively 95% (95% CI: 86.8–98.1) and 74.8% (95% CI: 68.0–80.9) compared to PCR. In study 1, the sensitivity among children (from 2 to 15 years old) and adults (above 15 years old) dropped to 45% (95% CI: 23.1–68.5) and 59% (95% CI: 32.9–81.6), respectively. In study 2, there were some differences in bed-management of SOFIA(®)RSV positive compared to SOFIA(®)RSV negative infants. CONCLUSIONS: SOFIA(®)RSV tests performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED show high and satisfactory sensitivities among young children under 24 months, which supports its robustness and reliability. However, the impact of these tests on patient care at point-of-care cannot be clearly assessed when considering the limits of the study 2 design.

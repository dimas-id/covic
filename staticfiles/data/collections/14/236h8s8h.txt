Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) is a frequent and severe complication of intensive care management. Within ICUAW critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and myopathy (CIM) can be differentiated. The major symptom of ICUAW is progressive quadriparesis, which makes weaning from the respirator more difficult, can appear early after admission to an ICU and can often be detected several months after discharge from the ICU. The pathophysiology of ICUAW is multifactorial and complex. Potential therapeutic approaches are the early and sufficient therapy of mulitorgan dysfunction, optimal control of glucose levels as well as early and intensive physiotherapy. This review article discusses the data on incidence, pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches and prognosis of ICUAW.

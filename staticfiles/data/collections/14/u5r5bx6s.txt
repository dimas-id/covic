This chapter reviews the remarkable recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis that underlies the pathophysiology of sepsis. This knowledge has improved diagnostic techniques and introduced new therapeutic agents into the standard management of patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. The current treatment regimens for sepsis are discussed, and the evidence to support each major treatment strategy is outlined in detail. Research priorities to further the optimal management of septic shock in the future are highlighted.

Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that commonly features high-flow arteriovenous malformations (AVM) within the pulmonary, intracranial, and visceral circulation. We present a patient with a unique case of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome featuring a high-flow pelvic AVM in addition to fibromuscular dysplasia affecting multiple vascular beds. This required a unique modification of our embolic therapeutic approach for adequate treatment of the AVM.

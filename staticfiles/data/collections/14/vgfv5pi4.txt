A generalized computer model of forest growth and nutrient dynamics (LINKAGES) was adapted for the temperate evergreen forests of New Zealand. Systematic differences in species characteristics between eastern North American species and their New Zealand counterparts prevented the initial version of the model from running acceptably with New Zealand species. Several equations were identified as responsible, and those modeling available light were extended to give more robust formulations. The resulting model (LINKNZ) was evaluated by comparing site simulations against independent field measurements of stand sequences and across temperature and moisture gradients. It successfully simulated gap dynamics and forest succession for a range of temperate forest ecosystems in New Zealand, while retaining its utility for the forests of eastern North America. These simulations provided insight into New Zealand conifer–hardwood and beech species forest succession. The adequacy of the ecological processes, such as soil moisture balance, decomposition rates, and nutrient cycling, embodied in a forest simulation model was tested by applying it to New Zealand forest ecosystems. This gave support to the model’s underlying hypothesis, derived from LINKAGES, that interactions among demographic, microbial, and geological processes can explain much of the observed variation in ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage and cycling. The addition of a disturbance option to the model supported the hypothesis that large‐scale disturbance significantly affects New Zealand forest dynamics.

Abstract As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, we as healthcare professionals thrive to continue to help our patients, and as orthopedic surgeons this goal is ever more challenging. As part of a major academic tertiary medical center in New York City, the orthopedic department at New York University (NYU) Langone health has evolved and adapted to meet the challenges of the COVID pandemic. In our report, we will detail the different aspects and actions taken by NYU Langone Health as well as NYU Langone orthopedic Hospital and the Orthopedic Department in particular. Among the steps taken, the department has reconfigured its staff’s assignments to help both with the institution’s efforts and our patients’ needs, from reassigning operating room nurses to medical COVID floors to having attending surgeons cover urgent care locations. We have reorganized our residency and fellowship rotations and assignments as well as adapting our educational programs to online learning. While constantly evolving to meet the institution’s and our patient demands, our leadership starts planning for the return to a new “normal”.

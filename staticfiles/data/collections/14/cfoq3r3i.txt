To investigate the evolutionary process by which porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the United States hypothetically descended from strains in China, we analyzed PEDV-positive samples collected in China during January 2012â€“July 2013. Recombination in 2 strain sublineages was likely associated with identification of PEDV in the United States in 2013.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pulmonary vascular disease characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling and vasoconstriction leading to elevated pulmonary artery pressure and, ultimately, right heart failure. So far, few cases of COVID-19 disease in patients with PH have been reported. Caution is warranted in interpreting this observation as data are evolving and several factors may influence the number of reported cases of PH and COVID-19. Social distancing and quarantine could play a role, especially for patients with chronic diseases who might be more vigilant of their potential for respiratory infection. In addition, PH is a rare disease, and because testing is not universal, we could be underestimating the number of cases. Other hypothetical factors to consider are the underlying pathophysiology of PH and the medications used to treat PH and their implications in COVID-19.

Summary On a glorious spring day in the American Midwest, friends, colleagues, collaborators, and alumni of Prof. M.G. Replacement gathered together at the campus of Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana to celebrate 40 years of structural biology and honor the man behind it all: M.G. Rossmann. The date also corresponded approximately to MGR’s 75th birthday. It was a memorable occasion for several reasons. An earlier meeting 10 years ago did also render homage to Michael (New Directions in Protein-Structure Relationships: Symposium in Honor of Professor M.G. Rossmann’s 65th Birthday, Purdue University, October 21, 1995), but on this occasion the symposium was much more encompassing of structural biology and had a more global character. A large number of featured speakers presented and discussed advances in vast areas of structural biology and came from the four corners of the world to share their work with the new generations of structural biologists currently being trained at Purdue University.

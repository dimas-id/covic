If inflammation caused by either non-self or self molecules can disseminate throughout the body and inflammatory sites actively allow entry of circulating tumor cells and assist regrowth, then circulating tumor cells metastasize to the sites of inflammation. However, disrupted sites of homeostatic inflammation do not necessarily guarantee metastatic spread and subsequent regrowth.

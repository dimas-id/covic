INTRODUCTION The low anterior rectal resection and double stapling technique are well-established surgical procedures with well-known pitfalls, potential complications, and preventive measures. Colovaginal anastomosis is a surgical error which should not occur. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 39-year old woman underwent low anterior resection with double stapling technique, for rectal carcinoma in the City Hospital. On the fifth postoperative day she noticed passage of gas and two days later passage of feces from vagina. The surgeons who performed the operation explained to her that it is a normal condition for such modern procedure that is supervised by international educator engaged by the Government. The patient lived with this condition, passage of gas and feces from the vagina and nothing from anus for three months when her oncologist referred her for a second opinion at the University Clinic for Digestive Surgery. The digital examinations revealed a blind rectal stump, and feces in vagina; thus having the patient's history in mind, we assumed that the patient had a colovaginal anastomosis. Our assumption was confirmed by two succeeding radiological examinations. Initially, water soluble contrast enema was performed to assess the colon, when a clear-cut blind rectal stump was detected. Afterwards, the vaginography revealed a copious flow of contrast material from the vagina toward the sigmoid colon. After a few days, a restorative surgery was done. DISCUSSION Most of the early postoperative complications are a result of surgical errors. CONCLUSION We believe that there is no excuse for such a surgical error and postoperative follow-up.

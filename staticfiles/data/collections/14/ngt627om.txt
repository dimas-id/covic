Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is reserved for acute ischaemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. The various MT techniques employed in the treatment of hyperacute strokes are constantly evolving with new devices and improvisation of existing technology (Wahlgren, et al 2016). In this review, we describe a variety of MT techniques gained from our experience of performing over 350 procedures in 7 years of providing a 24/7 service within the national framework of a hyperacute stroke centre. We outline a number of endovascular techniques, procedure limitations, and potential complications.

INTRODUCTION Uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is a modification of the Billroth II procedure with Braun anastomosis, in which a jejunal occlusion is fashioned to avoid the Roux Stasis Syndrome. This review aimed to summarize the current knowledge about the uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis operation, so that surgeons may be able to make informed decisions about its clinical application. Additionally, we hope that our findings will guide future research on this topic. Areas covered: The original uncut technique was associated with dehiscence or recanalization of the jejunal occlusion, and was therefore not widely applied. However, with recent improvements in the method of jejunal occlusion, the uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction may be an appropriate alternative for digestive tract reconstruction after distal gastrectomy. This review summarizes the basic research on and clinical applications of uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy from the following several aspects: origin of the uncut reconstruction technique, rationale for uncut reconstruction based on data from animal experiments, clinical results of the uncut reconstruction, recanalization and its countermeasures, and so on. Expert commentary: The uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is a controversial yet promising method of gastrointestinal reconstruction after distal gastrectomy. Prospective randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up outcomes are required to support the modified technique in the future.

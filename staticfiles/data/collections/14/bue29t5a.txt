Abstract This chapter begins by describing the food-borne illnesses including all food intoxications and infections with epidemiology, symptoms, pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and recent outbreaks. It is observed that one kind of disease which is prevalent in a particular area can now be transmitted with ease to another with export and import of food globally. It then explains the international laws, agreements, and standards to mitigate these food-borne diseases and to regulate the production, processing, and marketing of food all over the world.

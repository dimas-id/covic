The clinical translation of tissue engineering approaches is limited by the requirement of a cell source. Cell guidance is a new concept that provides an alternative approach, obviating a requirement for an external cell source. This relies on site-specific homing and differentiation of the patient's own cells to an implanted scaffold through controlled delivery of cytokines. In this study, we used stromal-cell-derived factor 1-alpha (SDF-1α) in combination with bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 or transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 to induce cell migration and osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation, respectively, in implanted scaffolds in a rat model. A customized cytokine microdelivery apparatus was used to ensure the constant rate and concentration of cytokine delivery around the scaffold. The formation of osteoid or early cartilage was observed after 4 weeks in specimens treated with SDF-1α and either BMP-2 or TGF-β1. The density of cellular infiltrate and formation of differentiated tissue were lower in scaffolds treated only with BMP-2 or TGF-β1. Thus, controlled SDF-1α delivery induces cell migration into scaffolds and can result in enhanced osteogenesis and chondrogenesis when used in combination with differentiation cytokines for purposes of tissue engineering.

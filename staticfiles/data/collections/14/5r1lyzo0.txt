AIM A moderate acute-phase response occurs 24-h following full-mouth non-surgical treatment (FM-SRP). The aim of this study was to compare acute-phase (24-h) and medium-term (3 months) inflammation after quadrant scaling (Q-SRP) versus FM-SRP. MATERIAL & METHODS Thirty-eight periodontitis-affected subjects were randomly allocated to FM-SRP or Q-SRP after a baseline visit. Periodontal and anthropometric parameters were collected at baseline and 3 months. Serum samples were drawn at baseline, 1, 7, and 90 days after treatment. High-sensitivity assays of inflammation and endothelial assays were performed. RESULTS FM-SRP produced a greater acute-phase response after 24 h [threefold increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), twofold increase in interleukin (IL-6), and a slight increase in tumour necrosis factor]. No differences in systemic biomarkers were noted between groups at any later follow-ups. Both periodontal treatments produced a comparable improvement in clinical periodontal parameters with no between-group differences. Treatment time was positively associated with the relative 24-h increase in CRP (R = 0.5, p < 0.001) and IL-6 (R = 0.5, p = 0.002), while the number of deeper (>6 mm) pockets predicted only the relative increase in IL-6 (R = 0.4, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS FM-SRP triggers a moderate acute-phase response of 24 h duration compared to Q-SRP. Further research is needed to assess the eventual impact of such findings on the risk of vascular events is advocated. (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01857804).

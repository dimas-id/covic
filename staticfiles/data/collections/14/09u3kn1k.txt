The acute respiratory disease COVID-19, caused by the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a worldwide pandemic affecting millions of people. The methodology that organizations who provide home health and personal home care services are using to respond to this pandemic has not yet been characterized. In this report, we describe our approach to comprehensive outbreak suppression and report an initial case series of COVID-19 positive patients receiving home-based services. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across our affiliates, and we communicated these protocols to our offices using multi-faceted methods. Using custom built software applications enabling us to track patient and employee cases and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and to suppress transmission. In the 100-day period between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020, our affiliates provided services to 67 COVID-19 positive patients (<0.3% of census). Twenty patients were referred to home health post hospitalization for COVID-19 related illness, whereas 47 were found to have COVID-19 while living in community settings. Of those who were found to have COVID-19 in the community, 17 (39%) required subsequent hospitalization. Hospitalized patients had an average age of 74.5 Â± 18, and 53% were male. There were 13 deaths (76%) among those hospitalized from the community with COVID-19 related illness. A highly coordinated and frequently communicated approach to infection control, case identification and employee screening can be performed by home health and personal home care organizations. Studies that further assess risks and predictors of illness severity in home-based COVID-19 patients are needed.

PURPOSE Endoscopic repair of inguinal hernia can decrease the incidence of chronic groin pain. Staple mesh fixation is the surgical technique preferentially used but may also cause residual pain. Although a substantial number of specialists advocate no mesh fixations, concerns are that this could lead to an increase in recurrence rates. This study aimed to assess the safety and the effectiveness of fibrin sealant, as an alternative technique to staple mesh fixation after totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A total of 472 patients underwent elective TEP inguinal hernia repair between February 2005 and July 2011. Mesh fixation was achieved using fibrin sealant. Patients were reviewed postoperatively at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 6. Patient satisfaction was assessed in a subgroup of 116 patients using a comprehensive scoring system designed for hernia repairs, and pain was assessed using a standard Visual Analog pain Scale. RESULTS No conversion to open surgery was observed. There were two cases of major morbidities and no mortality. Three months after surgery, only three patients (0.6 %) experienced chronic groin or testicular discomfort. At Week 6, 98.9 % of the patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with their outcome, and 96.8 % denied any residual pain. Finally, only six hernia recurrences (0.9 %) were reported, of which five occurred during the first months of the study. CONCLUSIONS Fibrin sealant is safe and reliable for mesh fixation of inguinal hernia during TEP repair with a very high satisfaction index and limited risk of developing chronic pain.

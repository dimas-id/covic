Free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) is an effective method to treat corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Some patients continued to receive maintenance doses of corticosteroids to treat the primary disease postoperatively. This study was performed to evaluate outcomes of FVFG for corticosteroid-induced ONFH in patients who continued to receive corticosteroids postoperatively. The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 44 patients (78 hips) who had received corticosteroid treatment for their primary disease after FVFG. They were followed up for at least 2 years (mean, 5.6 years). Demographic details, Harris Hip scores, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and radiographic data were collected and analyzed. The mean Harris Hip score for all hips was 70.9±9.9 points before surgery and increased to 84±12.1 points at the latest follow-up. There were also significant increases (P<.05) in physical component summary score and mental component summary score. According to the latest radiographic evaluation, 49 hips (62.8%) appeared improved, 10 hips (12.8%) appeared unchanged, and only 19 hips (24.4%) appeared worse. Seven hips (9%) underwent total hip arthroplasty during the follow-up period. Therefore, the results showed that FVFG was a viable method of treating corticosteroid-induced ONFH in patients who receive maintenance doses of corticosteroids postoperatively.

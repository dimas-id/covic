Abstract Patients with respiratory infections are often managed presumptively until confirmation of infection status. We assessed the impact of introducing the Enigma® MiniLab™ FluAB-RSV point-of-care test (POCT) on patients admitted with a suspected respiratory virus driven illness in an acute pediatric ward. This utilized a before and after design (respiratory viral seasons 2013/14 versus 2014/15). Following POCT implementation, oseltamivir prescribing increased in patients with influenza (OR = 12.7, P = 0.05, 95% CI [1.0, 153.8]). A reduction in the average reimbursement charges without a change in the length of stay was observed. Modeling suggested that laboratory test cost savings could be achieved if the POCT cost £30 and was used for screening, followed by the respiratory viral panel for RSV and influenza negative patients. A rapid POCT for influenza A/B and RSV infections in pediatric inpatients may improve oseltamivir prescribing, strengthen antimicrobial stewardship, reduce reimbursement charges and decrease laboratory costs.

Objective: This paper gives context on recent literature regarding the development of digital personal health libraries (PHL) and provides insights into the potential application of consumer health informatics in diverse clinical specialties. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Here, 2,850 records were retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE in March 2020 using search terms: personal, health, and library. Information related to the health topic, target population, study purpose, library function, data source, data science method, evaluation measure, and status were extracted from each eligible study. In addition, knowledge discovery methods, including co-occurrence analysis and multiple correspondence analysis, were used to explore research trends of PHL. Results: After screening, this systematic review focused on a dozen articles related to PHL. These encompassed health topics such as infectious diseases, congestive heart failure, electronic prescribing. Data science methods included relational database, information retrieval technology, ontology construction technology. Evaluation measures were heterogeneous regarding PHL functions and settings. At the time of writing, only one of the PHLs described in these articles is available for the public while the others are either prototypes or in the pilot stage. Discussion: Although PHL researches have used different methods to address problems in diverse health domains, there is a lack of an effective PHL to meet the needs of older adults. Conclusion: The development of PHLs may create an unprecedented opportunity for promoting the health of older consumers by providing diverse health information.

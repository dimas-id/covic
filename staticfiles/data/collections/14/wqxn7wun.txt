BACKGROUND Cervical esophagogastrostomy is currently the most common method for esophageal reconstruction after esophagectomy. The advantages and disadvantages of hand-sewn, linear-stapled, or circular-stapled anastomoses have been subject to debate in recent years. We explored a new method of end-to-side anastomosis using a circular stapler that embeds the anastomosis and the remaining esophageal tissue into the gastric cavity to reduce the occurrence of anastomotic leakage and to prevent gastroesophageal reflux. METHODS In 127 patients with esophageal carcinomas, end-to-side anastomoses with esophageal embedding were performed by connecting the anvil and body of the circular stapler inside the stomach before firing and embedding the anastomosis and remaining esophagus into the stomach after esophagectomy. Retrospective investigations on postoperative complications such as leakage, stricture, and gastroesophageal reflux were conducted. RESULTS A total of 123 patients (96.9%) had successful surgery, and 4 patients (3.3%) developed anastomotic leakage, with the total morbidity of 20 of 123 (16.3%) and in-hospital mortality of 1 of 123 (0.8%). The incidence of stricture (<1 cm) affected 14 of 123 patients (11.4%). Eight patients underwent dilatation treatment as a result of severe dysphagia (6.5%). Half of the patients [62 of 123 (50.4%)] experienced postoperative heartburn, 11 of 123 patients (8.9%) experienced acid regurgitation, and 16 of 123 patients (13.0%) experienced nocturnal cough. CONCLUSIONS Embedded cervical esophagogastrostomy with circular stapler is a simple and convenient method, with low incidence of anastomotic leakage and a good antireflux effect.

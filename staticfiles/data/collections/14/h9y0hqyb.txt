Modern board games offer an interesting opportunity for automatically generating content and models for ensuring balance among players. This paper tackles the problem of generating balanced maps for a popular and sophisticated board game called Terra Mystica. The complexity of the involved requirements coupled with a large search space makes of this a complex combinatorial optimisation problem which has not been investigated in the literature, to the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge. This paper investigates the use of particle swarm optimisation and steepest ascent hill climbing with a random restart for generating maps in accordance with a designed subset of requirements. The results of applying these methods are very encouraging, fully showcasing the potential of search-based metaheuristics in procedural content generation.

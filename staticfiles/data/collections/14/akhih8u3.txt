In late 2019, a novel coronavirus strain, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), also known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), triggered a global pandemic as the virus spread from the Wuhan Province, China, across all continents. Although infrequent, severe respiratory infection and death caused by SARS-CoV-2 is disproportionately high amongst healthcare providers such as craniofacial surgeons who work in the head and neck region. Factors this impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission include: (1) high viral loads in the mucosa of the oral and nasopharynx, (2) limited and/or imprecise disease screening/confirmation testing, (3) access to and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

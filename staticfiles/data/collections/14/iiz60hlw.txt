The immune system is central to our interactions with the world in which we live and importantly dictates our response to potential allergens, toxins, and pathogens to which we are constantly exposed. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie protective host immune responses against microbial pathogens is vital for the development of improved treatment and vaccination strategies against infections. To that end, inherited immunodeficiencies that manifest with susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and/or fungal infections have provided fundamental insights into the indispensable contribution of key immune pathways in host defense against various pathogens. In this mini-review, we summarize the findings from a series of recent publications in which inherited immunodeficiencies have helped illuminate the interplay of human immunity and resistance to infection.

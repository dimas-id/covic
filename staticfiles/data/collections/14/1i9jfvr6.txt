At present, routine dermatology practices stay mostly disrupted worldwide owing to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic. However, dermatology services need to be resumed in future and dermatologists especially in developing countries face a mammoth task of devising plans to tackle the upcoming surge of patients while still maintaining the precautions to avoid risk of infection to health care workers and our patients. Teledermatology practice is a viable alternative and there is need of starting functioning teledermatology centers at primary health care centers and training health care workers in telemedicine. Several steps like increasing the working hours of outpatient clinics, posting dermatologists and health staffs in shifts, encouraging online registration and payment, providing time slots to patients should be taken to prevent overcrowding at outpatient departments in hospitals of developing countries like India where the usual patient turnover during summers maybe around 600 to 800 per day. Once diagnosed by the dermatologist, a subsequent meticulous use of teledermatology can limit the number of follow‐up visits. To avoid student gatherings, the undergraduate and postgraduate teaching schedule should be replaced by online or virtual teaching in form of webinars and video conferencing. Above all, intense upgradation of health care infrastructure, recruitment, training of new health care staffs on mass level and huge investment in health care sector is required in all the developing countries.

COVID-19 virus has currently caused major outbreaks worldwide. ACE2 is a major cellular-entry receptor for the COVID-19 virus. Although ACE2 is known to be expressed in many organs, whether it is expressed by the conjunctival tissue is largely unknown. Human conjunctival tissues from 68 subjects were obtained, which included 10 subjects with conjunctival nevi, 20 subjects with conjunctivitis, 9 subjects with conjunctival papilloma, 16 subjects with conjunctival cyst, 7 subjects with conjunctival polyps, and 6 ocular traumas as normal subjects. Expression of ACE2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot assay. We observed the expression of ACE2 by conjunctival tissues, expecially in conjunctival epithelial cells. ACE2 was significantly (p<0.001) overexpressed in conjunctival cells obtained from subjects with conjunctivitis, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival papilloma, conjunctival cyst, and conjunctival polyps epithelial cells when compared to that in conjunctival epithelial cells obtained from control subjects. Collectively, clinical features of reported COVID-19 patients combined with our results indicate that COVID-19 is likely to be transmitted through the conjunctiva.

BACKGROUND Morbid obesity in both adolescents and adults has risen in an alarming rate. Bariatric surgery is playing an increasing role in pediatric surgery. However, current evidence is limited regarding its safety and outcome. METHODS Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered. For the current analysis, all adolescent and adult subjects that had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) from 2005 to 2014 were considered. RESULTS LSG represents the most common bariatric procedure in Germany with a proportion of 48.1% in adolescent and 48.7% in adult obese in 2014. LSG was performed in 362 adolescent and 15,428 adult subjects. Pre-operative BMI was comparable between the two populations. However, adult obese had more frequently coexisting comorbidities (p < 0.01). Complication rates and mortality (0 vs. 0.2%) did not differ significantly. Adolescents achieved a BMI reduction of 16.8 and 18.0 kg/m2 at 12 and 24 months compared with 15.4 and 16.6 kg/m2 in the adult group. There was a significantly higher BMI reduction in late adolescents (19-21 years) compared with patients â‰¤18 years at 24 months (19.8 vs. 13.6 kg/m2). Resolution rate of hypertension was significantly higher in adolescents. CONCLUSION LSG is a safe therapeutic option that can be performed in adolescents without mortality. Late adolescents experienced the highest weight loss; resolution rate of comorbidities was lower in adults. All future efforts should now be focused on the evaluation of the long-term outcomes of LSG in the pediatric population.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon, locally aggressive, soft tissue tumour. Occurrence in the head and neck region is rare and facial presentations are even rarer. We present a case of a DFSP in a young gentleman with the oncological, functional and aesthetic challenges that arose from the case. We also reviewed the relevant literature on DFSP pertaining to the head and neck region and devised a treatment algorithm based on the best available evidence.

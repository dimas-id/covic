Viral-like particles are assembled from capsid protein structural subunits of different viruses and have ability to establish research in biomedicals, like construction of novel safety vaccines, gene therapy vectors by delivering systems for nucleic acids, small biomolecules and diagnostics. Papaya Mosaic Viral nanoparticals can provide as a vaccine candidate helps to increase the immunity by fusing the epitope based peptide antigen. Capripox viruses are the genus comprises Lymphy skin-disease, Sheep and Goat pox Viruses are notified by The World Animal Health Organization (OIE) based on their economic impotence act as a transboundary animal diseases viruses of sheep, goat, and cattleâ€™s respectively. Plant viral based innovative vaccines have been emerged ineffective vaccine development. This research describes the engineering and development of a new vaccine candidate by display immunogenic peptide using the carrier capsid protein of Papaya Mosaic Virus. The Capripox virus P32 immunogenic protein is homologous of the vaccinia virus H3L gene displayed PapMV CP. The antigenicity of P32 protein epitope lowest score among epitopes C-terminally docked epitopes are EP6 > EP3 > EP8 as well the lowest score among epitopes N-terminally docked epitopes are EP8 > EP3 > EP6 presented on the N-terminus of PMV CP region which are found to be suitable for epitope display. And these modelled immunogenic peptide could be used to develop a viral like particles. Epitope based Antibody developed against immunogenic epitopic regions can contribute to a novel and robust protection from infection. As well might be used for developing cost effective detection kits for Transboundary animal disease viruses.

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF) is the most common cause of critical illness in oncologic patients. Despite significant advancements in survival of oncologic patients who develop critical illness, mortality rates in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation have improved but remain high. Avoiding intubation is paramount to the management of oncologic patients with ARF. There are important differences between the oncologic patient with ARF compared to the general ICU population that likely underlie the increased mortality once intubated. Noninvasive oxygen modalities have been recognized as an important therapeutic approach to prevent intubation. Continuous low-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive ventilation, and high-flow nasal cannula are the most commonly used noninvasive oxygen therapies in recent years. They have unique physiologic properties. The data surrounding their efficacy in the general ICU population and oncologic population has evolved over time reflecting the changes in the oncologic population. This chapter reviews the three different noninvasive oxygen modalities, their physiologic impact, and evidence surrounding their effectiveness.

esearchers at Scripps Research and the University of Hong Kong have shown how a human antibody for the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can also bind the new COVID-19-causing coronavirus (Science 2020, DOI: 10 1126/science abb7269) The structural insights from might help in COVID-19 vaccine and drug design, the researchers say During a SARS epidemic in 2006, researchers isolated antibodies for the virus, SARS-CoV, from infected patients Earlier this year, researchers in China showed that one of those antibodies, CR3022, also binds to the spike protein of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 (Emerging Microbes Infect 2020, DOI: 10 1080/22221751 2020 1729069) To see how exactly the antibody binds to the spike protein, a group led by Ian A Wilson ordered a sample of CR3022 and produced sections of SARS-CoV-2â€™s spike protein called the receptor-binding domain (RBD) The group used X-ray crystallography to find that, as predicted by the Chinese researchers, the View: PDF ;Full Text HTML

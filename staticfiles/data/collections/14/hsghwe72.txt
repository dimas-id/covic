We present a simple primary colour editing method for consumer product images. We show that by using colour correction and colour blending, we can automate the pain-staking colour editing task and save time for consumer colour preference researchers. To improve the colour harmony between the primary colour and its complementary colours, our algorithm also tunes the other colours in the image. Preliminary experiment has shown some promising results compared with a state-of-the-art method and human editing.

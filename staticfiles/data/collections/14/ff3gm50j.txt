HSPs are important mediators of a number of key intracellular reactions. Of importance to the care of the critically ill are their involvement in protein repair and tertiary structure. HSP70 is known to modulate inflammation and apoptosis. In models of acute lung injury and ARDS, over-expression of HSP70 improves outcome, ameliorates lung injury and attenuates inflammation. The involvement of HSP70 in other aspects of lung injury and in other components of MODS is under investigation.

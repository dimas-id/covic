Revisionary bariatric surgery procedures are becoming more frequent. Facing the challenge of complicated digestive tract changes after redo surgery, it is crucial to choose an appropriate method. Duodeno-ileal omega switch (DIOS), with growing clinical value as an easy malabsorptive procedure, has emerged as a treatment option. We would like to present a case of a 52-year-old obese male patient with a history of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and removal of a lesser curvature as a revision procedure to restore the restriction. In order to improve the patient's health outcome, a two-stage re-revision procedure was performed, including DIOS to reduce the weight of the patient and a gastric pouch reconstruction in order to achieve a better satiety effect. This case study illustrates the intrinsic potential of malabsorption surgery and makes us believe that it may be used as the primary operation in two-staged procedures for revisionary surgical treatment.

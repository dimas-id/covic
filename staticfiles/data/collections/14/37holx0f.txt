The physical and chemical properties of flax (linen) are attractive from the perspective of biomaterials science and engineering. Flax textiles uniquely combine hydrophilicity and strength, with the technical know-how to produce precisely engineered two- and three-dimensional knitted or woven structures. It is, however, extremely difficult to completely remove endotoxins from the flax, and this essentially precludes the use of linen for implant purposes. Herein, the potential utility of flax textiles for blood-contacting applications is investigated, using purified two-dimensional mesh specimens, with and without an albumin surface coating. It was hypothesized that the albumin coating will abolish the effect of adherent endotoxins at the flax's surface. In vitro cell viability assays showed that the flax mesh Â± albumin is not cytotoxic. The albumin coating reduced (but not abolished) the effect of surface-exposed endotoxins (Limulus amebocyte lysate test). Under dynamic conditions, the albumin coating favors coverage with endothelial cells. Experiments with fresh human blood plasma (platelet-rich and platelet-free) showed that the albumin coating reduces the thrombogenicity in vitro. Platelets adhered to the albumin-coated flax mesh showed a less flattened structure. Although the results of this work cannot be extrapolated easily to in vivo situations, the data reveal that woven or knitted tubular structures produced from flax fibers may hold promise as implantable blood contacting devices like for instance vascular grafts.

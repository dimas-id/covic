Abstract A series of 2-substituted benzoxazinones were synthesized and subjected to anti-human coronavirus and ICAM-1 expression inhibition assays. Among them, compounds 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 exhibited significant anti-HCoV activities, and the IC50 value of these compounds are 6.08, 5.06, 6.83, 1.92, 7.59, and 5.79μg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 1 and 6 showed significant inhibitory effect on ICAM-1 expression, the ED50 values of 1 and 6 are 1.00 and 0.50μg/mL, respectively.

Recent advances in nucleic acid based testing using bio-optical sensor approaches have been introduced but most are based on hybridization between the optical sensor and the bio-molecule and not on an amplification mechanism. Direct nucleic acid amplification on an optical sensor has several technical limitations, such as the sensitivity of the temperature sensor, instrument complexity, and high background signal. We here describe a novel nucleic acid amplification method based on a whispering gallery mode active resonator and discuss its potential molecular diagnostic application. By implanting nanoclusters as active compounds, this active resonator operates without tapered fiber coupling and emits a strong photoluminescence signal with low background in the wavelength of low absorption in an aqueous environment that is typical of biosensors. Our method also offers an extremely low detection threshold down to a single copy within 10 min due to the strong light-matter interaction in a nano-gap structure. We envision that this active resonator provides a high refractive index contrast for tight mode confinement with simple alignment as well as the possibility of reducing the device size so that a point-of-care system with low-cost, high-sensitivity and simplicity.

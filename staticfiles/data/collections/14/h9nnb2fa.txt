BACKGROUND C-reactive protein (CRP) is used to monitor patients' response during treatment of infectious diseases. Morbidity and mortality associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is high, particularly in hospitalized patients. Better risk prediction during hospitalization could improve management and ultimately reduce mortality rates. AIM To evaluate CRP measured at admission and the third day of hospitalization as a predictor for adverse events in CAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with CAP at an academic hospital. Major adverse outcomes were admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital length of stay, hospital complications and 30-day mortality. Predictive associations between CRP (as absolute levels and relative decline at third day) and adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS Eight hundred and twenty-three patients were assessed, 19% were admitted to ICU and 10.6% required mechanical ventilation. The average hospital stay was 8.8 ± 8.2 days, 42% had nosocomial complications and 8.1% died within 30 days. Ninety eight percent of patients had elevated serum CRP on admission to the hospital (18.1 ± 14.1 mg/dL). C-reactive protein measured at admission was associated with the risk of bacterial pneumonia, bacteremic pneumonia, septic shock and use of mechanical ventilation. Lack of CRP decline within three days of hospitalization was associated with high risk of complications, septic shock, mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS CRP responses at third day of hospital admission was a valuable predictor of adverse events in hospitalized CAP adult patients.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) generally causes self-limiting viral hepatitis. However, in pregnant women, HEV infection can be severe and has been associated with up to 30% mortality in the third trimester. Additionally, HEV infection in pregnancy is also associated with high rates of preterm labor and vertical transmission. MAIN BODY: HEV is now recognized as a global health problem in both developing and industrialized countries. HEV can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, zoonotic route, and blood transfusion route. An altered immune status, hormonal levels, and viral factors may be related to the severity of the disease. Currently, no established treatment is available for HEV in pregnant women. A Chinese vaccine has been demonstrated to be protective against HEV in the general population and seems to be safe in pregnancy; however, its safety and efficacy in a large population of pregnant women remain to be determined. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the current knowledge about HEV infection during pregnancy and focuses on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, mechanisms underlying severe liver injury, and management and prevention of HEV infection during pregnancy. Considering that HEV infection during pregnancy may result in poor outcomes, screening for and monitoring HEV infection early in pregnancy should be taken into account. In addition, a better understanding of the pathogenesis will help to develop potential treatment strategies targeting HEV infection in pregnancy.

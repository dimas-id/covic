The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of life in the United States and around the globe, including significant impacts to higher education, both in its teaching-learning and research missions. With the physical closure of so many college and university campuses, a looming challenge is how nurse researchers can continue to generate new knowledge during a temporary but extended period of social distancing where conducting research requiring physical interaction with participants is impossible. In this Methodology Corner installment, a brief overview of secondary data analysis is provided, and resources for locating potentially useful data are described. Although secondary data analysis will not replace the dominant approaches used in nursing education research, current circumstances require it to take a much more prominent place in the toolbox of nursing education researchers.

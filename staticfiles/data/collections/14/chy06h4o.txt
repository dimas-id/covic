Hantaviruses belong to the Bunyaviridae family. A large number of different subtypes are known worldwide that show a host-specific geographical distribution. Humans may become infected through contact with rodent urine, saliva or feces. In humans, hantavirus infections are an important and worldwide emerging zoonotic disease that may result in a variety of potentially life-threatening diseases, e. g. hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS).

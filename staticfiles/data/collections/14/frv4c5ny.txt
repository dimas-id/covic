• We quantified the COVID-19 transmissibility by the basic reproductive number. • The COVID-19 transmissibility could be negatively associated with ambient ozone. • The daily 1-h maximum ozone might cover 7.6% of the transmissibility variability. • It echoes a previous study of negative effects of ozone on the flu transmission. • The ground-level ozone may be a “double-edged sword” to public health.

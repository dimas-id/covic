Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan City, China, the main transmission mode as well as the diagnosis and treatment of NCP have become a focus of research in China and World Health Organization.Understanding the mode of infection, transmission and biological behavior of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is undoubtedly a key of cutting off the spread and prevention of the disease which doctors are fearing to be a worldwide epidemic.In February 2020, Lancet published a correspondence paper, which reviewed a case of NCP patient who first started with conjunctivitis, and raised the issue that the transmission of 2019-nCoV through the ocular surface must not be ignored, causing widespread concern.However, due to a lack of clinical observation data and laboratory research at present, the relationship between NCP pathogen infection and ocular surface infection is not completely clear.So far, there have been many studies and reports on the observation of large-scale epidemic virus infections and eye diseases.This article reviews the eye performance of various types of epidemic virus infections and provides a reference for NCP prevention and control.

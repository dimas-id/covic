We reported the analytical interference of anti-Escherichia coli protein (EP) antibodies in human sera and residual EP in a recombinant nucleocapsid protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as a possible source of false positives in severe acute respiratory syndrome serodiagnosis. The rate of false positives was significantly reduced by adding mouse anti-EP antiserum in the blocking step.

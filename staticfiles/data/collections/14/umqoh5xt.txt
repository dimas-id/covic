Choreographic development envisages distributed coordination as determined by interactions that allow peer components to harmoniously realise a given task. Unlike in orchestration-based coordination, there is no special component directing the execution. Recently, choreographic approaches have become popular in industrial contexts where reliability and scalability are crucial factors. This tutorial reviews some recent ideas to harness choreographic development of message-passing software. The key features of the approach are showcased within [Image: see text] , a toolchain which allows software architects to identify defects of message-passing applications at early stages of development.

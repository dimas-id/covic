Thromboembolic complications related to SARS-CoV-2 have been extensively reported. They include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, ischemic stroke, and acute coronary syndrome. Penile thrombosis has not been reported as a thrombotic complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with hypercoagulability. Here we describe a case of priapism as a thromboembolic complication in a patient with COVID-19 who recovered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We discuss the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms mainly related to an hypercoagulability state. Emergency management consisted on an intracavernosal injection of the sympathomimetic agent ethylephrine and cavernosal blood aspiration. The patient experienced no recurrences under thromboprophylaxis by enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily.

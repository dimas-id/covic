Infected pancreatic necrosis is a life-threatening complication of acute pancreatitis that has been traditionally managed with open surgical debridement. Over the last decade, minimally invasive techniques have been increasingly used for the treatment of infected pancreatic necrosis and their results are encouraging. Percutaneous retroperitoneal pancreatic necrosectomy is one of the minimally invasive approaches used for debridement of pancreatic necrosis. We report our technique of retroperitoneoscopic necrosectomy using a single-port access.

Foamy viruses (FVs) are classified in the family Retroviridae, but recent data have shown that they are not conventional retroviruses. Notably, several characteristics of their particle replication strategies are more similar to those of hepatitis B virus (HBV) than those of typical retroviruses. Compared to conventional retroviruses, which require only Gag proteins for budding and release of virus-like particles (VLPs), both FV and HBV require Env proteins. In the case of HBV, Env (S protein) alone is sufficient to form subviral particles (SVPs). Because FVs also depend on Env for budding, we tested whether FV Env alone could produce SVPs. The Env proteins of FV and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were both released into cell culture supernatants and migrated into isopycnic gradients; however, unlike MuLV Env, FV Env displayed characteristics of SVPs. FV Env particles were of greater density than those of MuLV (1.11 versus 1.07 g/ml, respectively), which strongly suggested that the released proteins of FV Env were particulate. When we examined FV SVPs by immunoelectron microscopy, we found particles that were consistent in morphology, size, and staining with gold beads, similar to FV VLPs and unlike the particle-like structures of MuLV Env, which were more consistent with vesicles produced from nonspecific membrane "blebbing." Taken together, our results demonstrated that FV Env alone is sufficient for particle budding. This finding is unique among retroviruses and further demonstrated the similarities between FV and HBV.

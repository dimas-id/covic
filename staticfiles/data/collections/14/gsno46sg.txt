This commentary offers a critique of the recent policy document issued by White et al. (2020) to guide critical care resource (e.g. ventilators) allocation during public health emergencies such as COVID-19. We argue that, if disseminated widely, this criteria would result in a racially inequitable resource distribution in the current COVID-19 crisis. We link the White et al. (2020) resource distribution protocol to other "colorblind" healthcare algorithms that have relied on seemingly objective but fundamentally biased data, thereby reinforcing and exacerbating pre-existing racial health disparities. We suggest a health equity framework to ensure unbiased distribution of critical care resources during COVID-19 and in general practice.

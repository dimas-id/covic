BACKGROUND With the ever-increasing burdens of adhering to the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA), it is important for mammography centers to use technology to work smarter and faster and capture as much revenue as possible. At the same time, patient satisfaction and employee satisfaction have a synergistic effect on the quality of patient care and the financial status of the clinic. METHOD This comprehensive literature review examines the effects of MQSA, technology and patient and employee satisfaction on the operations of a quality breast imaging center. RESULTS A best practice model is offered that combines the best of these elements based on current literature.

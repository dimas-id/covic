This article presents a review of the literature related to disaster preparedness and nursing. A definition of disaster as set forth by the American Red Cross is provided. Eight themes, including (1) defining disaster, (2) nursing during and after disaster, (3) nursing education in disaster preparedness, (4) military nurse preparedness, (5) postdisaster stress, (6) ethical issues and intent to respond, (7) policy, and (8) hospital emergency policy, were derived from the review and are explored in this article. Although a plethora of disaster-related literature exists, the voice of the nurses who worked during these disasters is missing. Areas of proposed research illuminated by current research are suggested.

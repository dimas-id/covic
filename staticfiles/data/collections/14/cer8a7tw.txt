We systematically reviewed the current use of Google Street View (GSV) in health research and characterized major themes, strengths and weaknesses in order to highlight possibilities for future research. Of 54 qualifying studies, we found that most used GSV to assess the neighborhood built environment, followed by health policy compliance, study site selection, and disaster preparedness. Most studies were conducted in urban areas of North America, Europe, or New Zealand, with few studies from South America or Asia and none from Africa or rural areas. Health behaviors and outcomes of interest in these studies included injury, alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity and mental health. Major strengths of using GSV imagery included low cost, ease of use, and time saved. Identified weaknesses were image resolution and spatial and temporal availability, largely in developing regions of the world. Despite important limitations, GSV is a promising tool for automated environmental assessment for health research. Currently untapped areas of health research using GSV include identification of sources of air, soil or water pollution, park design and usage, amenity design and longitudinal research on neighborhood conditions.

Early ophthalmological care of patients in intensive care with SARS-CoV‑2 (Severe-Acute-Respiratory-Syndrom-Corona-Virus-2) infections is very time-consuming; however, this approach might prevent other ophthalmological diseases, such as lagophthalmos. There is no difference in ophthalmological treatment between SARS-CoV‑2 positive and other intensive care patients. Due to the small number of cases in our observational study, a specific ophthalmological clinical pattern related to SARS-CoV‑2 infections cannot currently be identified; however, the increased occurrence of subconjunctival hemorrhage in intensive care SARS-CoV‑2 patients is remarkable. It remains unclear how ocular symptoms in SARS-CoV‑2 infections are related or how they occur in different stages of the disease. Therefore, further studies are necessary for representative statements.

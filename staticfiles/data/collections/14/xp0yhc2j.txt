Sequential recommendation leverages the temporal information of users’ transactions as transition dependencies for better inferring user preference, which has become increasingly popular in academic research and practical applications. Short-term transition dependencies contain the information of partial item orders, while long-term transition dependencies infer long-range user preference, the two dependencies are mutually restrictive and complementary. Although some work investigates unifying both long-term and short-term dependencies for better performance, they still neglect the fact that short-term interactions are multi-folds, which are either individual-level interactions or union-level interactions. Existing sequential recommendations mainly focus on user’s individual (i.e., individual-level) interactions but ignore the important collective influence at union-level. Since union-level interactions can reflect that human decisions are made based on multiple items he/she has already interacted, ignoring such interactions can result in the disability of capturing the collective influence between items. To alleviate this issue, we proposed a Joint Relational Dependency learning (JRD-L) for sequential recommendation that exploits both long-term and short-term preferences at individual-level and union-level. Specifically, JRD-L combines long-term user preferences with short-term interests by measuring short-term pair relations at individual-level and union-level. Moreover, JRD-L can alleviate the sparsity problem of union-level interactions by adding more descriptive details to each item, which is carried by individual-level relations. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate JRD-L outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for the sequential recommendation.

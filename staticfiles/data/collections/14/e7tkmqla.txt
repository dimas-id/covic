PURPOSE OF REVIEW Functional and molecular aortic imaging has shown great promise for evaluation of aortic disease, and may soon augment conventional assessment of aortic dimensions for the clinical management of patients. RECENT FINDINGS A range of imaging techniques is available for evaluation of patients with aortic disease. Magnetic resonance blood flow imaging can identify atherosclerosis prone aortic regions and may be useful for predicting aneurysm growth. Computational modeling can demonstrate significant differences in wall stress between abdominal aortic aneurysms of similar size and may better predict rupture than diameter alone. Metabolic imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET [(FDG)-PET] can identify focal aortic wall inflammation that may portend rapid progression of disease. Molecular imaging with probes that target collagen and elastin can directly exhibit changes in the vessel wall associated with disease. SUMMARY The complexity of aortic disease is more fully revealed with new functional imaging techniques than with conventional anatomic analysis alone. This may better inform surveillance imaging regimens, medical management and decisions regarding early intervention for aortic disease.

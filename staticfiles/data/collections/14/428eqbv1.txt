Abstract Increase of microvascular permeability is one of the most important pathological events in the pathogenesis of trauma and burn injury. Massive leakage of fluid from vascular space leads to lose of blood plasma and decrease of effective circulatory blood volume, resulting in formation of severe tissue edema, hypotension or even shock, especially in severe burn injury. Fluid resuscitation has been the only valid approach to sustain patientâ€™s blood volume for a long time, due to the lack of overall and profound understanding of the mechanisms of vascular hyperpermeability response. There is an emerging concept in recent years that some so-called barrier stabilizing mediators play a positive role in preventing the increase of vascular permeability. These mediators may be released in response to proinflammatory mediators and serve to restore endothelial barrier function. Some of these stabilizing mediators are important even in quiescent state because they preserve basal vascular permeability at low levels. This review introduces some of these mediators and reveals their underlying signaling mechanisms during endothelial barrier enhancing process.

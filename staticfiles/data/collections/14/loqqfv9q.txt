Data presented in this study indicates that the following systems; Eyetone-Ames, Dextrometer-Ames, Chemstrip bG-BioDynamics, and Stat Tek-BioDynamics, perform with accuracy in the estimation of blood glucose as compared to the results of the Beckman Auto-Analyzer. The Dextrostix-Ames system did not provide the accuracy necessary for blood glucose screening.

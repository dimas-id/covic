Abstract Central nervous system (CNS) infections have multiple potential causative agents for which simultaneous pathogen screening can provide a useful tool. This study evaluated a multiplexed microarray for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against CNS pathogens. The performance of selected microarray antigens for the detection of IgG antibodies against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, was evaluated using serum sample panels tested with reference assays used in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The microarray sensitivity for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, adenovirus and M. pneumonia ranged from 77% to 100%, and the specificity ranged from 74% to 97%. Very variable sensitivities and specificities were found for borrelial antigens of three different VlsE protein IR(6) peptide variants (IR6p1, IR6p2, IR6p4) and three recombinant decorin binding proteins A (DbpA; DbpAIa, DbpA91, DbpAG40). For single antigens, good specificity was shown for antigens of IR6p4 and DbpAIa (96%), while DbpA91, IR6p1 and IR6p2 were moderately specific (88â€“92%). The analytical sensitivity of the microarray was dependent on the borrelial IgG concentration of the specimen. The overall performance and technical features of the platform showed that the platform supports both recombinant proteins, whole viruses and peptides as antigens. This study showed diagnostic potential for all six CNS pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, using glutaraldehyde based microarray, and further highlighted the importance of careful antigen selection and the requirement for the use of multiple borrelial antigens in order to increase specificity without a major lack of sensitivity.

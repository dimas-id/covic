Anesthesia for liver transplantation pertains to a continuum of critical care of patients with end-stage liver disease. Hence, anesthesiologists, armed with a comprehensive understanding of pathophysiology and physiologic effects of liver transplantation on recipients, are expected to maintain homeostasis of all organ function. Specifically, patients with fulminant hepatic failure develop significant changes in cerebral function, and cerebral perfusion is maintained by monitoring cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and intracranial pressure. Hyperdynamic circulation is challenged by the postreperfusion syndrome, which may lead to cardiovascular collapse. The goal of circulatory support is to maintain tissue perfusion via optimal preload, contractility, and heart rate using the guidance of right-heart catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography. Portopulmonary hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome have high morbidity and mortality, and they should be properly evaluated preoperatively. Major bleeding is a common occurrence, and euvolemia is maintained using a rapid infusion device. Pre-existing coagulopathy is compounded by dilution, fibrinolysis, heparin effect, and excessive activation. It is treated using selective component or pharmacologic therapy based on the viscoelastic properties of whole blood. Hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia from massive transfusion, lack of hepatic function, and the postreperfusion syndrome should be aggressively treated. Close communication between all parties involved in liver transplantation is also equally valuable in achieving a successful outcome.

Despite recent advances in surgical techniques including staple closure and ultrasonic devices, the reported incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after distal pancreatectomy (DP) remains high. Therefore, we devised a new strategy in which the pancreatic stump is enveloped with the elevated jejunum (EJ) by a modified Blumgart anastomotic technique. Eighty-one patients who underwent open DP with splenectomy from January 2008 to December 2014 were enrolled. Comparisons were made between 42 patients who underwent placement of an EJ patch using the modified Blumgart method after scalpel transection and 39 patients who underwent scalpel transection alone, using unmatched and propensity score-matched analysis. After 25 patients from each group were selected by propensity score matching, the EJ patch technique was significantly associated with a lower incidence of clinically relevant POPF (P = 0.036). Multivariate analysis showed that the EJ patch was an independent predictor of a lower incidence of POPF (odds ratio, 0.16; 95 % confidence interval, 0.01â€“0.48; P = 0.017) as was the estimated remnant pancreatic volume. Addition of the EJ patch improves postoperative outcomes in patients who undergo open DP with splenectomy by scalpel transection and hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant.

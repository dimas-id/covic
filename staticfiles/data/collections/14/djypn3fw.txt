In the last ten years, the single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is gaining more interest than the traditional laparoscopic surgery (LAP). Many studies make a comparison between the performances of the SILS and the LAP. The results show that the single incision laparoscopic surgery reduces pain, length of period of postoperative hospitalization, and loss of blood. This technique is also able to reduce the infection sites. In spite of many advantages, SILS reveals some problems: laparoscopic instruments triangulation and small workspace. The surgeon has to be more skillful to make a surgery in SILS because the surgeon has only three laparoscopic instruments and only one hole in the abdomen cavity. In this paper, a novel laparoscopic instrument to help the surgeon during a SILS operation is presented. This instrument is innovative forceps with double graspers. Different designs of this instrument are presented, with the final one which greatly simplifies both construction and operation. The initial experience in the laboratory with the innovative instrument is presented. The surgeon experienced in laparoscopic surgery and with the help of assistants performed a training program based on predetermined task performed in simulation box (laparoscopic box-trainer).

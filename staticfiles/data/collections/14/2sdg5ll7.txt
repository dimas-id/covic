Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the infected liver. Clinical interventions have been inefficient due to the lack of knowledge for inflammatory pathogenesis in the virus-infected liver. We show that wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), a model for viral FH, manifest with severe disease and high mortality in association with a significant elevation in IL-1β expression in the serum and liver. Whereas, the viral infection in IL-1β receptor-I deficient (IL-1R1 (-/-)) or IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) treated mice, show reductions in virus replication, disease progress and mortality. IL-1R1 deficiency appears to debilitate the virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) production in macrophages and CD45(+)Gr-1(high) neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The quick release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the infected macrophages suggests a plausible viral initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further experiments show that mice deficient of p47 (phox), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit that controls acute ROS production, present with reductions in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion during viral infection, which appears to be responsible for acquiring resilience to viral FH. Moreover, viral infected animals in deficiencies of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, also have reduced IL-1β induction along with ameliorated hepatitis. Our results demonstrate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis institutes an essential signaling pathway, which is over activated and directly causes the severe liver disease during viral infection, which sheds light on development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.

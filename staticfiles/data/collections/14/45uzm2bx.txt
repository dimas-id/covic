UNLABELLED The improvement of laparoscopic techniques that we witnessed over the last decade, also applied to pancreatic surgery. Both worldwide and in Poland, increasingly more patients with lesions located within the body and tail of the pancreas are treated using laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. The aim of the study was to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy. MATERIAL AND METHOD Between January 2009 and March 2013, 107 patients underwent distal pancreatectomy at a single institution: 39 using laparoscopic technique and 68 using open technique. This was a retrospective study. RESULTS There were no significance differences with regard to duration of the surgical procedure, duration of hospitalization and complication rate between both groups. Statistically significant difference was found for the incidence of spleen preservation in patients undergoing laparoscopy, due to better visualization of the structures. In the group of patients with pancreatic cancer there was no significance difference in the incidence of malignancy found in the surgical margin. Our results are similar to that presented in the literature. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a safe method, with a higher rate of spleen preservation among the patients with the lesion located in the body and tail of the pancreas.

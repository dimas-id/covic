Recently, an increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 patients with COVID-19 syndrome, which overlaps with Kawasaki Disease (KD), have been reported, supporting the suggestion that infection is one of the triggers of KD.

Here we discuss the etiology of these syndromes from the point of view of infection and genetic susceptibility.

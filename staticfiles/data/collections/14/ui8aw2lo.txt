Chronobiology lost a great and distinguished physician-scientist, Pietro Cugini (Figure 1). He will be dearly missed by his family, his friends, and the field he helped shape and guide as he remained active until the end of his life at 83 years of age. In the middle of the worst pandemic the world has known in recent times, but not from COVID-19, Pietro passed away unexpectedly in front of his Rome apartment, on Via Latina, the same street where he was born and where he spent most of his life. He was buried shortly afterward in the Monumental cemetery of Marino. There was no formal ceremony as funerals were suspended because of the coronavirus. A proper ceremony will take place as soon as travel and congregation are possible. Pietro is survived by his three children, Silvia, Raffaella and Riccardo Cugini.

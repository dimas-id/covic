physics, chemistry, and biology have been connected by a web of causal explanation organized by induction-based theories that telescope into one another. … Thus, quantum theory underlies atomic physics, which is the foundation of reagent chemistry and its specialized offshoot biochemistry, which interlock with molecular biology — essentially, the chemistry of organic macromolecules — and hence, through successively higher levels of organization, cellular, organismic, and evolutionary biology. … Such is the unifying and highly productive understanding of the world that has evolved in the natural sciences.

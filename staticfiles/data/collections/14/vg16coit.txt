BACKGROUND Hepatic parenchymal transection is the most invasive step in donor operation. During this step, blood loss and unintended injuries to the intrahepatic structures and hepatic remnant may occur. There is no evidence to prove the ideal techniques for hepatic parenchymal transection. The aim of this study is to compare the safety, efficacy, and outcome of clamp-crush technique versus harmonic scalpel as a method of parenchymal transection in living-donor hepatectomy. METHODS Consecutive living liver donors, undergoing right hemi-hepatectomy, during the period between May 2015 and April 2016, were included in this prospective randomized study. Cases were randomized into two groups; group (A) harmonic scalpel group and group (B) Clamp-crush group. RESULTS During the study period, 72 cases underwent right hemi-hepatectomy for adult living donor liver transplantation and were randomized into two groups. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding preoperative demographic and radiological data. Longer operation time and hepatectomy duration were found in group B. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding blood loss, blood loss during hepatectomy, and blood transfusion. More unexpected bleeding events occurred in group A. Higher necrosis at the cut margin of the liver parenchyma was noted in group A. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding postoperative ICU stay, hospital stay, postoperative morbidities, and readmission rates. CONCLUSION Clamp-crush technique is advocated as a simple, easy, safe, and cheaper method for hepatic parenchymal transection in living donors.

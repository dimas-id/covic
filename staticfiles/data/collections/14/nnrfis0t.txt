The inherent complexity of biomedical systems is well recognized; they are multi-scale, multi-science systems, bridging a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. This article reviews the currently emerging field of multi-scale modelling in computational biomedicine. Many exciting multi-scale models exist or are under development. However, an underpinning multi-scale modelling methodology seems to be missing. We propose a direction that complements the classic dynamical systems approach and introduce two distinct case studies, transmission of resistance in human immunodeficiency virus spreading and in-stent restenosis in coronary artery disease.

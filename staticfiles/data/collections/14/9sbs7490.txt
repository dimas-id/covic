Tree substitution grammars are formal models that are used extensively in natural language processing. It is demonstrated that their expressive power is located strictly between the local tree grammars and the regular tree grammars. A decision procedure for the problem of determining whether a tree substitution grammar generates a local tree language is provided. Unfortunately, the class of tree substitution languages is neither closed under union, nor intersection, nor complements. Indeed unions of tree substitution languages even generate an infinite hierarchy. However, all finite and all co-finite tree languages are tree substitution languages.

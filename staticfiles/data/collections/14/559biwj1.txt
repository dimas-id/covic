This volume is composed by a set of short papers corresponding to some of the contributions that were sent to be presented at the fifth edition of the International Workshop on Functional and Operatorial Statistics (IWFOS). This fifth edition was to be held in June 2020 in Brno (Czech Republic), but had to be postponed as a consequence of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this introduction is to make a fast presentation of these contributions by putting them into the recent trends in Functional Data Analysis and related fields.

BACKGROUND: The preparations of healthcare systems to accommodate the large numbers of severely ill COVID-19 patients in March/April 2020 also had a substantial impact on rheumatological patient care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this online survey was to assess the changes and current status of rheumatology departments and practices in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient operations. Questions addressed the following issues: characteristics of the department, impact on patient care, application of recommendations, personal protective equipment (PPE), and organizational adaptations to the new framework conditions. The survey was available for 14 days and closed on 3 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 66 complete answers were recorded and evaluated. In the first 4 weeks of the COVID-19 crisis the proportion of outpatients in the institutions decreased on average by −40.6%. The number of outpatients receiving infusions decreased by −25.6%. Of the inpatient facilities 81% reported an average decrease of hospitalized patients of −54.9% and 52% of the participants complained of a lack of PPE. Organizational adjustments are reported. CONCLUSION: The rheumatological services were significantly reduced 4 weeks after the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic had reached Germany on a large scale. The study showed that in this phase there were decisive turning points in patient care and implicated substantial organizational and ultimately also economic effects on the healthcare system, both in hospitals and private practices. As the survey cannot adapt to the daily dynamic changes in priorities it serves as a first snapshot, which requires follow-up studies.

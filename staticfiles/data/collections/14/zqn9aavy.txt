As the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 continues and the number of confirmed cases requiring isolation increases, there is a need for a safe and efficient system to assess patients' condition. We developed and evaluated a self-assessment questionnaire consisting of 23 symptoms with linear-scale scores from 0 to 10. Patients were asked to indicate their worst score for each symptom daily, and medical personnel assessed clinical improvement or deterioration based on the changes in scores. Focused communication on severity of specific symptoms was the primary advantage for the clinicians, and a thorough check for their symptoms was helpful for patients.

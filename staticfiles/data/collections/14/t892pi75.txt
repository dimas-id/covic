AIM: Before population screening of ‘healthy’ individuals is widely adopted, it is important to consider the harms and benefits of receiving positive results and how harms and benefits may differ by age. SUBJECTS & METHODS: Participants in a preventive genomic screening study were screened for 17 genes associated with 11 conditions. We interviewed 11 participants who received positive results. RESULTS: Interviewees expressed little concern about their positive results in light of their older age, the risk condition for which they tested positive, or other pressing health concerns. CONCLUSION: Researchers and clinicians should recognize that returning positive results may not have the impact they presume given the diversity of the conditions screened and those who choose to undergo screening.

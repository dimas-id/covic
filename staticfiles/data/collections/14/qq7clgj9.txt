Abstract Immunization with a synthetic peptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to mouse myelin basic protein exon-2 induced mild experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) in B10.RIII mice, very mild disease in SJL/J mice and no disease in (SJL Ã— PL)F1 hybrid mice. In contrast, adoptive transfer of an exon-2 peptide-specific T cell line from SJL mice induced severe relapsing EAE in syngeneic recipients. The T cell line was specific for exon-2 peptide and did not cross-react appreciably with an MBP preparation consisting of the 18.5 and 14-kDa isoforms. mRNA for exon-2 containing isoforms could be demonstrated in the spinal cord of SJL/J and B10.RIII mice by amplification using exon-2 and exon-4 oligonucleotide primers. On a relative basis, the level of exon-2 cDNA was lower than that of exon-1 cDNA in the same spinal cord preparations from both strains of mice.

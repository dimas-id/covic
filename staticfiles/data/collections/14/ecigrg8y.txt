Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was diagnosed in more than 8437 patients in 25 countries between February and July 2003. During this period the World Health Organisation issued a global alert about SARS and together with the Centre for Disease Control have coordinated their efforts to investigate its pathogenesis and treatment. The outbreak in Hong Kong has been dramatic due to its geographical proximity with Guangdong province, China where the first case of SARS was reported. SARS has been described as a rapidly progressive, sometimes fatal pneumonia with a case fatality rate of 7.6% requiring intensive care. The four case reports illustrate a number of important points concerning the recognition, treatment, management and prevention of SARS, and highlights the importance of considering vigilant assessment and monitoring of patients with SARS. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences in caring for critically ill patients with SARS in the intensive care unit to nurses globally in order to reduce SARSâ€™ morbidity and mortality as well as to protect nurses and other healthcare workers from this disease that is so far threatening the community at large.

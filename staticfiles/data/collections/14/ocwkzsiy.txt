The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has highlighted the importance of hospital infection-control programs. Prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission also requires effective infection control in health-care facilities. In Taipei, Taiwan, an area with moderate to high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) (50-74 cases per 100,000 population), health-care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk for M. tuberculosis (Taiwan Center for Disease Control, unpublished data, 2002). In April 2003, SARS-related screening in a hospital in Taipei resulted in the detection of suspected TB among HCWs. This report summarizes how SARS screening led to the discovery of 60 cases of TB. HCWs in Taiwan should remain vigilant for cases of TB so persons suspected of having TB are evaluated and treated promptly.

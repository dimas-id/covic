Abstract Bats are important hosts of many viruses and in several cases they may serve as natural reservoirs even for viruses with zoonotic potential worldwide, including Europe. However, they also serve as natural reservoir for other virus groups with important evolutionary relevance and yet unknown zoonotic potential. We performed viral metagenomic analyses on Miniopterus schreibersii bat fecal samples. As a result, a novel parvovirus was detected for the first time in European bats. Although, bufavirus was recently discovered as a novel human infecting parvovirus, here we report sequence data of the first bufavirus from European bats related to human bufaviruses. Based on our sequence data a possible intragenic recombination event was detected within bufaviruses which may serves as an important milestone in their evolution.

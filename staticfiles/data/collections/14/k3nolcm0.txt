Neisseria meningitidis remains the most important cause of bacterial meningitis worldwide. The second most common and potentially severe end-organ manifestation of invasive meningococcal disease is meningococcal pneumonia. It occurs between 5% and 15% of all patients with invasive meningococcal disease. N. meningitidis sepsis and meningitis continue to be associated with high morbidity and mortality, however, meningococcal pneumonia is uncommon and often underreported. We describe a case of sepsis secondary to pneumonia with N. meningitidis bacteremia, without any evidence of meningitis. This case reports aims at highlighting pneumonia as a presentation of N. meningitidis bacteremia, and the need for a high level of clinical suspicion to establish the diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: : One effect of the COVID-19 pandemic is the disruption of in-person clinical experiences within geriatric psychiatry residency education. Online resources for trainees are needed to fill resultant gaps. METHODS: : The AAGP Teaching & Training Committee leadership collaborated with geriatric psychiatry experts to develop a web-based geriatric psychiatry curriculum for psychiatry residents and other learners. In addition, we planned to obtain initial self-report outcomes of the curricular modules. RESULTS: : The COVID-19 AAGP Online Trainee Curriculum (aagponline.org/covidcurriculum) consists of approximately 30 video-recorded lectures provided by AAGP member experts. A demographic survey and pre-post survey attached to each module allow us to obtain learner characteristics and feedback on each module. CONCLUSIONS: : The Curriculum has the potential to supplement psychiatry residency education during the pandemic and potentially raise the profile of AAGP, with the goal of inspiring interest within geriatric psychiatry. Results of the initial self-report evaluation should be available in 1 year.

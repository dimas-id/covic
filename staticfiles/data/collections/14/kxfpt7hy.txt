The recent decades have witnessed various epidemics. This year, COVID-19 has severely hit the global tourism industry, especially in destinations that largely depend on tourists from Mainland China. While the government should prioritize the curbing of epidemics, minimal attention has been paid to residents' positive outlook of tourism recovery, which affects public engagement during the recovery stage. Through an online survey conducted with 228 Macao residents in the early phase of epidemic, this study found that residents anticipate quick tourism recovery when they are satisfied with the government's performance in dealing with epidemic, because of their self-efficacy in avoiding infection and government efficacy in tourism recovery, but not relief of emotional concern. Implications for government at destination are also discussed.

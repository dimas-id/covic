AIM To examine the impact of diabetes mellitus on procedural outcomes of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion. METHODS We assessed the impact of diabetes mellitus on the outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion among 1308 people who underwent such procedures at 11 US centres between 2012 and 2015. RESULTS The participants' mean ± sd age was 66 ± 10 years, 84% of the participants were men and 44.6% had diabetes. As compared with participants without diabetes, participants with diabetes were more likely to have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery (38 vs 31%; P = 0.006), and to have had previous heart failure (35 vs 22%; P = 0.0001) and peripheral arterial disease (19 vs 13%; P = 0.002). They also had a higher BMI (31 ± 6 kg/m2 vs 29 ± 6 kg/m2 ; P = 0.001), similar Japanese chronic total occlusion scores (2.6 ± 1.2 vs 2.5 ± 1.2; P = 0.82) and similar final successful crossing technique: antegrade wire escalation (46 vs 47%; P = 0.66), retrograde (30 vs 28%; P = 0.66) and antegrade dissection re-entry (24 vs 25%; P = 0.66). Technical (91 vs 90%; P = 0.80) and procedural (89 vs 89%; P = 0.93) success was similar in the two groups, as was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (2.2 vs 2.5%; P = 0.61). CONCLUSIONS In a contemporary cohort of people undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion, nearly one in two (45%) had diabetes mellitus. Procedural success and complication rates were similar in people with and without diabetes.

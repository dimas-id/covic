Operative treatment of hepatic hydatid cyst is technically demanding procedure. The method of choice is conservative treatment with Albendazolum followed by surgery. Open laparotomy or laparoscopic operation can be performed. We prefere laparoscopic exploration followed by laparoscopic total pericystectomy or laparoscopic partial pericystectomy. If laparoscopic operation is not possible due to technical reasons and patient safety, conversion to an open operation should be done, followed by total or partial pericystectomy. The case and our detailed technique of laparoscopic partial pericystectomy with biliostasis and omentoplasty is described. Laparoscopic operation is equally safe for the patient, yet with minor trauma and better aesthetic effect.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the lung function and radiological changes in rehabilitating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients of medical staff in Beijing. METHODS Follow-up lung function tests and chest high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) were performed in medical staff with SARS from Dec. 2003 to Feb. 2004. RESULTS Thirty-one (7.64%) of 406 patients showed abnormal ventilatory function, while 165 of 404 patients showed diffusing abnormality. Of the 434 patients who had received HRCT scans, 151 (34.79%) showed abnormalities including subpleural and basal ground-glass and reticular attenuation, nodular septal thickening and bronchiectasis. Of the 395 patients who had received both lung function test and HRCT scanning, 55 (13.92%) had abnormalities both in the lung function and HRCT. The decrease in diffusing capacity in patients with HRCT changes was more significant than those without HRCT changes. CONCLUSIONS Lung function and lung imaging were abnormal in some patients with SARS after recovery. It is suggested that the lung damage is chronic, and follow-up is needed.

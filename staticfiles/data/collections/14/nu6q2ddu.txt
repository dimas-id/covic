Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration on graft function in a canine single-lung transplantation model. Methods Fifteen left single-lung transplantations were done in weight-mismatched canine pairs. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group 1, in which transplantation was done without cardiopulmonary bypass; group 2, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and in which the cardiopulmonary bypass flow was decreased slowly with controlled pulmonary artery pressure; and group 3, in which transplantation was done with cardiopulmonary bypass and ultrafiltration. Hemodynamic parameters and lung function were monitored for 6 hours after reperfusion. The grafts were harvested for histologic studies, myeloperoxidase assay, and real-time quantitive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of mRNA encoding interleukin 6. Results The hemodynamic parameters were similar among the 3 groups. In group 1 Pao 2 and alveolar to arterial gradient for O2 levels were excellent throughout the 6-hour observation period, but in group 2 they progressively deteriorated. However, ultrafiltration significantly (P = .02) improved the Pao 2 level in group 3. On histology, interstitial edema and polynuclear cell infiltration were most marked in group 2 and significantly worse than in groups 1 and 3. Myeloperoxidase assay and real-time quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed increased myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression in group 2 grafts compared with group 1 grafts. Myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin 6 gene expression were suppressed with ultrafiltration. Conclusions Cardiopulmonary bypass had negative effects on the graft, but ultrafiltration attenuated acute lung dysfunction by reducing the inflammatory response.

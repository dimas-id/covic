Femoro-popliteal PTA for the treatment of critical limb ischemia is frequently associated with unsatisfactory procedural success rates while directional atherectomy (DCA) has improved success rate since claudicant patients undergoing percutaneous treatment of femoro-popliteal obstructive disease. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and procedural success of DCA, at one year, in the percutaneous treatment of femoro-popliteal obstructive disease in patients with critical limb ischemia. METHODS From March 2012 to March 2013 18 consecutive patients with critical limb ischemia were treated with DCA (Turbohawk/Covidien-ev3 Endovascular Inc., North Plymouth, Minnesota, USA) for the treatment of femoro-popliteal obstructive disease. Patients were evaluated at 12 months. RESULTS Technical and procedural success was achieved in every patient. No in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events occurred. Primary endpoint: freedom from any amputation was obtained in all patients. Secondary endpoints: clinical (Rutherford class improvement) and hemodynamic success (Ankle-brachial index improvement) was achieved in all patients. CONCLUSION The use of DCA for the treatment of femoro-popliteal obstructive disease is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for patients with critical limb ischemia. The data included in our study should be considered hypothesis-generating in order to design of a randomized trial comparison with conventional PTA.

The immunosuppressive drugs used for the treatment of psoriasis may affect the clinical presentation and outcome of COVID-19 infection. Herein, we report a 73-year-old male patient with severe psoriasis being treated with cyclosporine (CsA) 100mg daily plus methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 mg weekly (biologic treatment was not accessible) who experienced disease flare-up after the discontinuation of psoriasis treatment during COVID-19 infection.

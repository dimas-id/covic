BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is a possible advancement for minimally invasive surgical interventions. However, this technique requires a specialized multichannel port for introducing laparoscope and instruments. We present our preliminary experience of using a homemade transumbilical single-port access for performing LESS. METHOD An Alexis wound retractor was placed through the umbilical incision, and a pair of sterile surgical gloves was then snapped onto it. Standard laparoscopic trocars were inserted through the gloves after the upper half parts of the gloves were truncated. Using this port and Roticulator articulating instruments, we performed 14 urologic LESS procedures on porcine laboratory and cadaveric cases, and we performed 10 transabdominal pre-peritoneal inguinal hernia repairs (TAPP), and 5 laparoscopic varicocelectomies on human cases, respectively. All procedures were performed with instruments inserted through this port without the need for any extraumbilical incisions or conversion to standard laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS All LESS procedures were successfully completed without any complications. The time to achieve the transumbilical port ready for subsequent LESS was short (range, 4-8 (median, 6) minutes). The total operative time was between 60 and 190 minutes. No port-related complications were noted, and the cosmetic results were excellent. CONCLUSIONS This homemade transumbilical port offers a safe, reliable, flexible, and cost-effective access for LESS procedures. This technique may be an alternative for current specialized port systems.

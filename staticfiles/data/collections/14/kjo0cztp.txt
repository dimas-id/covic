Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can affect pregnancy, posing risks to mother and fetus. CAP is the most common fatal nonobstetric infectious complication and a common cause of hospital readmission. Risk factors of pneumonia in pregnancy relate to anatomic and physiologic respiratory changes and immune changes. Aspiration can occur during labor, can cause life-threatening disease, and is more common in cesarean deliveries. Influenza pneumonia can cause severe disease, increasing the risk of preterm delivery, abortion, cesarean section, maternal respiratory failure, and death. CAP treatment requires considering antimicrobial appropriateness and safety, choosing therapy in line with guidelines, but considering maternal and fetal risk.

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread and cause death in worldwide. The preventative measures and infection control are underway throughout the society and there are signs of convergence in some areas. Other viruses as well as SARS-CoV-2 cause cold-like symptoms and spread in winter. However, it is unclear to what extent SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and other causative viruses have been prevailed since the preventative measures were implemented. In this study, we conducted multiples PCR and quantitative reverse transcription PCR using nasal swabs from 191 patients with cold-like symptoms in Japan to reveal the causative viruses. As a result, at least one virus were detected in 40 out of 191 (21%) patients. Of these, we frequently identified the human rhinovirus / enterovirus (5.8%, n=11), SARS-CoV-2 (4.2%, n=8) and human metapneumovirus (3.7%, n=7). On the other hand, no influenza virus was detected. These results shows the prevalence of causative viruses after the social preventative measures and implies the difference of infectivity between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus.

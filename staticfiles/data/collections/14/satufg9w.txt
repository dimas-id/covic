BACKGROUND: Limited studies have been published on practices and management of COVID-19 in children. Despite the fact that COVID-19 rarely caused any severe disease in children, the asymptomatic children might be playing an important role for spreading COVID-19 in healthcare facilities. This review aimed at sharing our experience of how to handle patients with COVID-19 in a pediatric referral and tertiary care hospital to prevent the possible transmissions to the healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: This review sought to identify infection control practices measures during COVID-19 pandemic comes from our daily practice combined with the most recent guidelines with the new experience and information. RESULTS: Prevention the transmission of COVID-19 to the HCWs, four primary themes should be taken into consideration; (1) ongoing education and importance of the organization of the healthcare facility, (2) proper clinical triage and isolation of the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in the outpatient clinics and in the emergency departments, (3) necessity of the organization of the COVID-19 wards, and (4) utilization of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Infection control precautions to prevent the possible transmissions to HCWs as well as the other patients and their caregivers from children with COVID-19 are very critical. If sufficient precautions are not taken, healthcare settings may serve as additional source of transmission and spread of COVID-19 in the society.

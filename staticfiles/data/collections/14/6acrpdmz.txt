Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have caused high mortality of piglets and significant economic losses to the Chinese swine industry. In the current study, 184 specimens from pigs with or without signs of diarrhea were collected from 39 farms across eight provinces, mainly around Hunan, People's Republic of China, in 2017 to 2018 in order to obtain epidemiological information on PEDV infections in these regions. The results indicated an average PEDV-positive rate of 38.04% (70/184) and more-pronounced disease severity in diarrheic pigs (48.76%; 59/121) than in non-diarrheic pigs (17.46%; 11/63). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis demonstrated that 14 representative PEDV strains from 14 swine farms belonged to the G2 group (G2-a and G2-b subgroups) and displayed a high degree of genetic variation. In particular, two out of the 14 PEDV strains were found to have unique indels in the S1 gene. The strain HN-SY-2017-Oct had a 9-nucleotide (T(1152)GAAGCCAAT(1160)T) insertion, and the strain ZJ-2018-May had a 3-nucleotide (AAA) deletion at position 1126 in the S1 gene. A three-dimensional structural prediction revealed that these unique insertions might lengthen the loop on the surface or increase the likelihood of the surface protein being phosphorylated at (388)Y, thereby affecting the virulence or pathogenicity of PEDV. Collectively, the data show that PED remains a severe threat to the pig industry and that variant PEDV stains are circulating in China. The updated PEDV epidemiological data will facilitate the design of PEDV vaccines and the application of effective measures for PED prevention.

Understanding the pathogenesis of certain viral agents is essential for developing new treatments and obtaining a clinical cure. With the onset of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the beginning of 2020, a rush to conduct studies and develop drugs has led to the publication of articles that seek to address knowledge gaps and contribute to the global scientific research community. There are still no reports on the infectivity or repercussions of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the central lymphoid organ, the thymus, neither on thymocytes or thymic epithelial cells. In this brief review, we present a hypothesis about lymphopenia observed in SARS patients and the probable pathological changes that the thymus may undergo due to this new virus. Key words: Thymus, coronavirus, lymphopenia.

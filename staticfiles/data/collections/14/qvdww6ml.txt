This chapter reviews the expression of intestinal brush-border disaccharidases (maltase-glucoamylase, sucrase-isomaltase, lactase, and trehalase) and peptidases (aminopeptidases A and N and dipeptidyl peptidase IV) during development in growing animals. It describes the roles of intestinal enzymes, focussing on complementarity with salivary, gastric, and pancreatic digestive enzymes and their hydrolytic function in the process of absorption. Gene expression of the enzymes and nutritional regulation of their expression appear during postnatal development up to maturity. After translation of the specific mRNA, a single precursor of maltaseglucoamylase (pro-MG), rich in mannose, is produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In contrast to the relatively small number of carbohydrases, the number of peptidases found in enterocytes in the small intestine is large, because of the large number of different peptide bonds in oligopeptides produced by the action of pancreatic proteases. The digestive function (disaccharidase and peptidase activities) of the enterocytes and their microvilli begins when structural differentiation is complete, that is, during the period of migration over the cryptvillus junction. Modern techniques and investigations are expected to yield relevant data for elaborating feeding strategies that take into account the complex interactions between the diet, the microflora, the luminal milieu and the physiology of the small intestine, including the optimal functioning of the immunological and endocrine systems.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a complex and debilitating disease of the lungs, which continues to have a high mortality rate and huge disease burden on patients. Incidence is rising, possibly due to greater awareness leading to more diagnoses rather than a change in the underlying rate. It arises from multiple etiologies, though pathogenic infection, termed pneumonia, is the most prevalent and widely studied. The distinct pathophysiology and rapid evolution of ARDS makes it uniquely challenging with regard to therapeutics development and, to date, no medicines are licensed for specific therapy. Antibiotics, ventilation, and other organ support remain intervention standards.

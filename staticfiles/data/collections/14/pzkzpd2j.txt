COVID-19 utilizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) pathway as a means of infection. Early data on COVID-19 suggest heterogeneity in the severity of symptoms during transmission and infection ranging from no symptoms to death. The source of this heterogeneity is likely multifaceted and may have a genetic component. Demographic and clinical comorbidities associated with the severity of infection suggest that possible variants known to influence the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway (particularly those that influence ACE2) may contribute to the heterogenous infection response. ACE2 and angiotensin(1-7) (the product of ACE2) seem to have a protective effect on the pulmonary and cardiac systems. Hypertension medication modulation, may alter ACE2 and angiotensin(1-7), particularly in variants that have been shown to influence renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system function, which could be clinically useful in patients with COVID-19.

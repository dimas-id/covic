AIM We aimed to present a case of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) in a pregnant woman. CASE A 27-year-old, 24-week pregnant woman was referred to our clinic with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination and laboratory tests showed that she had acute biliary pancreatitis. An obstetric consultation showed that the patient and the fetus were healthy. After medical treatment the patient was discharged. However, she was again referred to our clinic with a second pancreatitis attack. We examined the patient and recommended cholecystectomy. Preoperative tests were completed and a new obstetric consultation was requested. After the receipt of informed consent for cholecystectomy, SILC was performed. CONCLUSIONS SILC is a feasible surgical method in pregnant women as well.

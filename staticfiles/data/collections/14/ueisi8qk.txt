Guidelines for diabetes foot care are available and should be part of the routine care and evaluation of all elderly patients who have diabetes. Those individuals who have good sensation, good vascularity, without foot deformities, and are capable of reaching and seeing their feet may do well with education and reasonable approaches to footwear and foot care. Those who have advanced diabetic complications of neuropathy or vascular insufficiency should be seen by professionals and given intensive education. An experienced team familiar with the progression of illness should follow those who have ulcers. Guidelines are presented for the management of outpatient and inpatient therapy of foot ulcers.

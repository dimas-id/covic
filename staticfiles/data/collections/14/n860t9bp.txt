OBJECTIVE Although there are several variations of laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomies, there is no consensus as to the best technique. Our objective was to describe our technique and assess the outcomes of our approach to hand-assisted laparoscopic retroperitoneal donor nephrectomies. METHODS From July 2001 to October 2015, 507 consecutive hand-assisted laparoscopic retroperitoneal donor nephrectomies were performed. Their clinical information was retrospectively reviewed including warm ischemia time, skin incision to kidney ready time, estimated blood loss, adverse intraoperative events, and postoperative complications. RESULTS Mean incision time to kidney removal was 135 minutes (55-260), mean warm ischemia time was 125 seconds (30-390), and mean blood loss was 83 mL (20-500). Average length of stay was 3 days (1-6). There were no significant differences between left and right kidney donors based on demographics, length of hospital stay, or warm ischemia time. There were no conversions to open surgery. Complications occurred in 4.9% of patients (25/507), including 4 cases of perioperative bleeding. CONCLUSIONS This is a single-center series describing the safety and efficacy of the hand-assisted laparoscopic retroperitoneal donor nephrectomy for both right and left sides. It does not require intraperitoneal manipulation and allows for safe extraction of either kidney with minimal warm ischemia time.

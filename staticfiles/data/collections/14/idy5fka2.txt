Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of an acute, highly contagious, and severe enteric disease that leads to high mortality rates in suckling piglets. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of PEDV infection is critical for the implementation of control measures for the virus. Many diagnostic tests have been recently developed and are currently available for the detection of PEDV, its proteins or nucleic acid, including virus isolation, immunofluorescence (IF) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal amplification assays. Additionally, several serological assays have been developed and are currently used for the detection of antibodies against PEDV. Molecular assays such as real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) became the methods of choice for the diagnosis of PEDV infection, providing sensitive, specific and rapid detection of the virus RNA in clinical samples. Whereas serological assays have been widely used to monitor prior exposure to the virus and to evaluate the efficacy of novel vaccine candidates or vaccination strategies. Here we discuss the properties of current PEDV diagnostic assays and prospects for improving diagnostic strategies in the future.

As COVID-19 delivered a devastating blow around Europe, unprecedented mental health issues have arisen. This study outlines the Greek translation and validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in the general population. A sample of 3029 Greek-speaking individuals completed the FCV-19S, as part of a large online survey reporting on the aftermath of the coronavirus on the psychological health of Greeks. A total of 2970 participants completed all items without missing values, and their responses were included in the statistical analysis. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested an acceptable model fit. The internal consistency measured by Cronbachâ€™s alpha = .87 for the whole scale. All hypothesized correlations were as expected, confirming the construct validity of the scale. The results of the analyses suggest that the psychometric properties of the Greek FCV-19S are sufficient.

Abstract The purpose of this article is to describe two pediatric neuro-ophthalmological clinical cases caused by a systemic infection due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). The cases are two girls aged 14 and 12 seen in the Emergency Department: The first one had internuclear ophthalmoplegia and second with loss of vision and headache. They had no other neurological foci. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense plaques in both, suggestive of a demyelinating disease. One month later, the neuro-ophthalmological symptoms resolved, with normal follow-up magnetic resonance imagings. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalitis secondary to M. pneumoniae. The diagnosis was made using PCR (gold standard) and/or IgM in serology. It is important to think about this possible etiology in cases of suggestive demyelinating disease. There is controversy about the role of antibiotics and on whether corticosteroids are contemplated. In conclusion, M. pneumoniae must be a differential diagnosis in acute neuro-ophthalmological disorders in children.

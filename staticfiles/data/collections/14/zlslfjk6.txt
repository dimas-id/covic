BACKGROUND The pharmaceutical therapy for acute ischemic stroke has shortcomings in reopening large vessels and dissolving long thrombi, and endovascular treatment has been found to provide added value. The Aperio thrombectomy device showed promising results in an experimental study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the device clinically. METHODS 119 patients with acute stroke were treated in nine centers using the Aperio thrombectomy device. Target vessel, diameter, thrombus length, procedure time, recanalization, number of deployments, additional use of anticoagulants, complications, and the use of additional devices were assessed. RESULTS The median thrombus length was 15 mm (range 1.5-20 mm) and the average time from device insertion to recanalization was 30 min (range 5-120 min). Blood flow restoration (Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2-3) was achieved in 85%. In the majority of cases complete clot removal was achieved (TICI 0, 12%; TICI 1, 2%; TICI 2a, 14%; TICI 2b, 18%; TICI 3, 53%). The median number of deployments was 2 (range 1-6). Twelve procedural complications (10%) occurred. CONCLUSIONS The Aperio thrombectomy device seems to be an effective and adequately safe tool for reopening occluded cerebral arteries in the setting of acute stroke.

BACKGROUND Single-site or single-incision laparosopic surgery has recently been developed, but it is difficult to use in more complicated gastric bypass surgery. We have introduced a 2-site modified single-incision laparosopic surgery technique for laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). METHODS We used the umbilical site incision to place 2 ports (12 and 10 mm) to serve as the video port and working port for the stapler. Another small skin incision was placed at a left lateral abdominal site for the 5-mm working port. Through these working channels, we could use conventional laparoscopic instruments to perform LRYGB. The data from 100 consecutive 2-site LRYGB procedures (February 2009 to September 2009) were compared with the data from 100 traditional LRYGB procedures (September 2008 to January 2009). RESULTS The mean body mass index for the study group was 43 kg/m(2) (range 32-61), and mean age was 34 years (range 18-55). The procedures were successfully performed in all but 18 patients. These 18 patients had required an extra skin incision for a 5-mm port to complete the procedures. The mean operating time was 144 minutes (range 95-160), and blood loss was 56 mL (range 20-150). A total of 3 perioperative major complications (3%) occurred, and 6 patients (6%) had minor complications. The 2-site LRYGB group had a significantly longer operating time and more blood loss than the traditional LRYGB group but less pain and better cosmesis. CONCLUSION Two-site LRYGB generated minimal somatic pain and achieved excellent cosmetic results. We believe it can be applied as routine LRYGB surgery.

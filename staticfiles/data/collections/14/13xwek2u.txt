OBJECTIVE To present 515 LESS surgeries and report the perioperative outcomes and late complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. STUDY DESIGN We performed a prospective single-center study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). One surgeon trained in minimally invasive surgery performed 515 cases of LESS surgery from May 2008 to September 2011. RESULTS LESS gynecological surgery was performed on 515 patients (274 total hysterectomies; 26 subtotal hysterectomies; 87 adnexectomies including oophorectomy, salpingectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy; 100 ovarian cystectomies; 17 myomectomies; 11 others). The median age and body mass index of the patients were 45 years and 22.6 kg/mÂ², respectively. LESS surgery was successfully completed in 493 patients (95.7%) without the need for one or more ancillary ports or conversion to laparotomy. Twenty patients needed one or more additional ports and two cases were converted to laparotomy. One or more additional ports were required most frequently in ovarian cystectomy procedures (12/100, 12%). Thirty-six patients (7.0%) required intraoperative and/or postoperative transfusions. Each of these patients underwent hysterectomy (33/274, 12.0%) or subtotal hysterectomy (3/26, 11.5%). Perioperative complications (<30 postoperative days), excluding transfusions, occurred in 8 patients (1.6%) and included one case each of vault bleeding, vault abscess, stump watery discharge, rectal injury, and vesicovaginal fistula, and three cases of urinary tract injury. Late complications occurred in three patients (0.6%) and included two umbilical hernias and one vault evisceration. The overall complication rate, excluding transfusions, was 2.1% (11/515). CONCLUSION The rate of late postoperative complications, including umbilical port site hernia and vault evisceration, was not increased in this study, as compared to previous reports of single-port and conventional laparoscopic surgeries.

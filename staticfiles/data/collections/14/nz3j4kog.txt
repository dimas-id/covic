Extracellular vesicles releasing from various types of cells contribute to intercellular communication via delivering bio-molecules like nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids to recipient cells. Exosomes are 30-120 nm extracellular vesicles that participate in several pathological conditions. Virus-infected cells release exosomes that are implicated in infection through transferring viral components such as viral-derived miRNAs and proteins. As well, exosomes contain receptors for viruses that make recipient cells susceptible to virus entry. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection has become a worldwide urgent public health concern. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment existing for COVID-19 virus infection. Hence, it is critical to find a safe and effective therapeutic tool to patients with severe COVID-19 virus infection. Extracellular vesicles may contribute to spread this virus as they transfer such receptors as CD9 and ACE2, which make recipient cells susceptible to virus docking. Upon entry, COVID-19 virus may be directed into the exosomal pathway, and its component is packaged into exosomes for secretion. Exosome-based strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 virus infection may include following items: inhibition of exosome biogenesis and uptake, exosome-therapy, exosome-based drug delivery system, and exosome-based vaccine. Mesenchymal stem cells can suppress nonproductive inflammation and improve/repair lung cells including endothelial and alveolar cells, which damaged by COVID-19 virus infection. Understanding molecular mechanisms behind extracellular vesicles related COVID-19 virus infection may provide us with an avenue to identify its entry, replication, spreading, and infection to overcome its adverse effects.

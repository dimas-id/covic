BACKGROUND Previous studies have reported that the suppression of acid secretion by using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) results in dysbiosis of the small-bowel microbiota, leading to exacerbated small-bowel injuries, including erosions and ulcers. This study was designed to assess the association between PPI therapy and small-bowel lesions after adjustment for the differences in baseline characteristics between users and non-users of PPIs. METHODS We retrospectively studied patients suspected to be suffering from small-bowel diseases, who underwent capsule endoscopy between 2010 and 2013. We used propensity matching to adjust for the differences in baseline characteristics between users and non-users of PPIs. The outcomes included the prevalence of small-bowel lesions: erosion, ulcer, angioectasia, varices, and tumor. RESULTS We selected 327 patient pairs for analysis after propensity matching, and found no significant differences in the prevalence of small-bowel injuries, including erosions and ulcers, between users and non-users of PPIs. Two subgroup analyses of the effect of the type of PPI and the effect of PPI therapy in users and non-users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicated no significant differences in the prevalence of small-bowel injuries in these two groups. CONCLUSION PPI therapy did not increase the prevalence of small-bowel injury, regardless of the type of PPI used and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

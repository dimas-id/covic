Background This is a comprehensive analysis of 46 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from the NCBI and GISAID repository during early 2020. Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny and emergence of the novel co-evolving mutations in nine structural and non-structural genes among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in ten states of India have been assessed. Materials and methods 46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from the GISAID (39/46) or from NCBI (7/46) database. Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP/NSP12 protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation. Results Phylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of “genome-type clusters” and adaptive selection of “L” type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-CoVs. With regards to the novel co-evolving mutations, 2 groups are seen to circulate in India at present: the “major group” (52.2%) and the “minor group” (30.4%), harboring four and five co-existing mutations, respectively. The “major group” mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) were unique to the Indian isolates. Conclusion The study highlights rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and co-circulation of multiple clades and sub-clades, driving this pandemic worldwide. This comprehensive study is a potential resource for monitoring the novel mutations in the viral genome, changes in viral pathogenesis, for designing vaccines and other therapeutics.

Neurotropic and neuroinvasive capabilities of coronaviruses have been described in humans. Neurological problems found in patients with coronavirus infection include: febrile seizures, convulsions, loss of consciousness, encephalomyelitis, and encephalitis. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2. In severe cases, patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute cardiac injury. While seizures and status epilepticus have not been widely reported in the past five months since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with COVID-19 may have hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and severe metabolic and electrolyte disarrangements; hence, it is plausible to expect clinical or subclinical acute symptomatic seizures to happen in these patients. One should be prepared to treat seizures appropriately, if they happen in a patient who is already in a critical medical condition and suffers from organ failure.

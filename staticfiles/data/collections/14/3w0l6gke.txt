Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease most commonly seen in preterm infants, often presents without warning and is associated with very high mortality and morbidity. Progress in the prevention and treatment of NEC has been slow. In this article, we will discuss some of the reasons as to why this progress has been slow. We will describe some of the factors that appear to be highly associated and important components in the pathophysiology of NEC. We will discuss the intestinal microbial environment of the fetus as well as the preterm infant and how interaction of dysbiosis with an immature gastrointestinal tract combined with dietary factors play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC. Testable hypotheses are discussed as well as how these may lead to not only a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease but also the preventative strategies.

BACKGROUND Saccular aneurysms in the non-branching segment of the distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) are extremely rare. Here, we describe the first case of coil embolization using a simple, non-adjunctive technique for an aneurysm at this rare location. CASE DESCRIPTION A 74-year-old man with an asymptomatic, unruptured aneurysm of the right DACA was followed up annually for 3 years by medical checkup. Endovascular treatment was proposed because of a slight angiographic change in the shape of the aneurysm in the past year. The aneurysm at the non-branching site of the right calloso-marginal artery was 2 mm distal to the origin, and measured 3 mm in height and 3.3 mm in width, with a neck measuring 1.7 mm wide; the calloso-marginal artery diameter was 1.6 mm. The aneurysm was successfully embolized with a simple technique using a Pre-Shaped S Microcatheter and two coils. CONCLUSIONS The simple, non-adjunctive technique for coil embolization of saccular side-wall type aneurysm in the non-branching segment of the DACA could be performed using the appropriate catheter and a softer coil.

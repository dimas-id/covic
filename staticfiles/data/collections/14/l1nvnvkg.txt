SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is transmitted through respiratory secretions and saliva. The virus can also live for short periods of time (1 to several hours) on fomites such as doorknobs, handrails, and tables. Aerosolization of the virus can occur during procedures including bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and administration of nebulized treatments. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus does occur and may account for up to 60% of cases. Risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19 include age 65 and older, living in a nursing home or long term care facility, chronic lung disease, and others.

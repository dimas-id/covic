A 17‐year‐old young man with history of a congenital solitary left testis presented to our clinic in late April 2020 with left testicular swelling and discomfort over the preceding few weeks. The patient denied unintentional weight loss or nipple tenderness but reported new, mild left‐sided back discomfort. His medical history was notable for asthma and a congenitally absent right testis for which he underwent negative surgical exploration in childhood.

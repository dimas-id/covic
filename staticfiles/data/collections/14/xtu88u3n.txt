OBJECTIVE Systemic absorption of irrigation fluid can lead to a disturbed coagulation cascade. We compared the changes in hemostatic properties on using nonelectrolyte solution in monopolar hysteroscopic surgery (HS) with that on using isotonic saline in bipolar HS via rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) analysis. METHODS A total of 54 patients were randomized into 2 groups: 1 group underwent monopolar HS using a mixture of 2.7% sorbitol and 0.54% mannitol (the HSMP group), whereas the other group underwent bipolar HS using 0.9% isotonic saline (the HSBP group). The effects of these 2 methods on coagulation were assessed via pre and postoperative laboratory tests, including estimation of the international normalized ratio of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and ROTEM analysis. In addition, the hemoglobin, hematocrit, and electrolyte levels and the platelet count were analyzed. RESULTS Patient characteristics, volume of irrigation fluid absorbed, and type of procedure were comparable between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in the pre and postoperative values of ROTEM parameters between the 2 groups. Most postoperative ROTEM parameters, as compared with preoperative values, changed in both groups; clot formation time was prolonged, and the Î±-angle and maximum clot firmness were decreased. All ROTEM parameters were maintained within the normal range. Hematological parameters, including hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and platelet count, were significantly decreased postoperatively in both groups compared to the preoperative values. No pre and postoperative hematological and hemostatic parameters were significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION Irrigation fluid absorbed in healthy women during HS caused hypocoagulable changes in the blood, irrespective of the irrigant type, and no significant differences between HS using monopolar and bipolar electrodes were demonstrated.

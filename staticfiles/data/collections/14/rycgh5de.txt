Covid‐19 disease is caused by a novel SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and has been declared a pandemic on the 9(th) of March by WHO. Hallmark of COVID‐19 management is supportive care and there is still no convincing evidence on a treatment which will reduce mortality. Severe COVID‐19 associated sepsis characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), secondary bacterial pneumonias thrombotic complications, myocarditis, and gastrointestinal involvement are more prevalent in those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, cancer and age>70 years (Liang et al; 2020, Guan et al; 2019).

Curricular standards in STEM [9] and computer science have emphasized the role of asking questions to support inquiry learning in K-12 education. In this paper, we examine the role of questioning during collaborative computational modeling of scientific processes through discourse analysis to understand how students grapple with the synergistic application of STEM and CT to build, test, and evaluate their models. To our knowledge, limited research has targeted a systematic understanding of question posing during computational modeling in science. We aim to develop a better understanding of question posing in support of inquiry and problem-solving during model building.

Pharmaceutical agents are often given inappropriate precedence in the treatment of gastrointestinal tract diseases. Nutrients have marked influences on the gastrointestinal tract and manipulation of the diet provides clinicians with a powerful therapeutic strategy to be used alone or concurrently with drug therapy. During acute gastroenteritis a change from the animal's regular food to a diet containing novel protein sources minimizes the likelihood of acquired food allergies to the staple protein components of the diet. “Feeding through” diarrhea, a method used in human infants, has limited applicability in dogs and cats. The ideal diet for chronic small bowel-type diarrhea is highly digestible, gluten-free, hypoallergenic, isosmolar, low in fat and low in lactose. Dietary protein requirements increase in protein-losing enteropathy. Dietary fat is kept to a minimum during gastrointestinal dysfunction because malabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids cause secretory diarrhea. In diseases of the small bowel, it is traditional to use low fiber diets. This recommendation needs revision because the binding and gelling properties of fiber are of potential benefit in the treatment of small bowel diarrhea. High fiber diets are useful in most large bowel diseases. The specific fiber type used markedly influences the clinical result.

A modular video endoscope is developed to enable both white light imaging (WLI) and vital-dye fluorescence imaging (VFI) in a single-endoscopic insertion for the early detection of cancer in Barrettâ€™s esophagus (BE). We demonstrate that VFI can be achieved in conjunction with white light endoscopy, where appropriate white balance is used to correct for the presence of the emission filter. In VFI mode, a contrast enhancement feature is implemented in real time to further highlight glandular patterns in BE and related malignancies without introducing artifacts. In a pilot study, we demonstrate accurate correlation of images in two widefield modalities, with representative images showing the disruption and effacement of glandular architecture associated with cancer development in BE. VFI images of these alterations exhibit enhanced contrast when compared to WLI. Results suggest that the usefulness of VFI in the detection of BE-related neoplasia should be further evaluated in future in vivo studies.

The intensive poultry industries rely heavily upon the use of vaccines for disease control. Viral vector based vaccines offer new avenues for the development of vaccines for effective disease control in poultry. Techniques developed for the construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses have been readily adapted to the construction of recombinant viruses based on fowlpox virus (rFPV). The ability to insert several genes into the large genome of fowlpox may enable the development of multivalent vaccines and vaccines incorporating immune response modifiers such as lymphokines. Newcastle disease, avian influenza, infectious bursal disease and Marek's disease antigens expressed by rFPV have been shown to be effective vaccines in poultry. None appear, however, to provide a substantial improvement in vaccine efficacy. Recombinant FPV will be a valuable adjunct to conventional vaccines currently in widespread use. Whether rFPV or other vector based vaccines can circumvent the problems of vaccination in the presence of high maternally derived antibodies is yet to be resolved. The observation that avipoxvirus recombinants may be suitable for the vaccination of non‚Äêavian species provides an added dimension to vaccines based on FPV or other avipoxviruses. Recombinant FPV will find a useful role in poultry disease control when used in conjunction with conventional vaccines.

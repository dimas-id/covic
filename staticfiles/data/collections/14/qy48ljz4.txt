We describe a case of cardiac tamponade caused by ProTacks Autosuture used for mesh fixation during a laparoscopic Nissen operation with giant paraesophageal hernia repair. Perforations of the posterior descendent artery and epicardial vein of the right ventricle were caused by ProTacks used for Parietex Composite Mesh fixation. Protruding ProTacks were secured from inside the pericardiac sac with a synthetic vascular patch during emergency sternotomy. Quick and multidisciplinary cooperation ended with emergency cardiothoracic procedure saving the patient's life and preventing further damage to the heart muscle and its vessels.

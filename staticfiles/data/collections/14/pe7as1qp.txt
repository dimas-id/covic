BACKGROUND: The corona pandemic is currently the greatest challenge for health systems of all countries worldwide. The timely detection of the disease and the immediate separation and isolation of suspected cases make a significant contribution to breaking the chain of infection. METHODS: Based on the first 35 patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, we evaluated the various symptoms with which patients presented. RESULTS: The majority of patients have respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough and reduced peripheral oxygen saturation) and fever. In individual patients, however, there may only be other symptoms, e.g., gastrointestinal, neurological, or nonspecific symptoms.

Rolling circle amplification (RCA) developed in the mid-1990s has been widely used as an efficient isothermal DNA amplification process for molecular diagnosis. This enzymatic process amplifies target DNA sequences with high fidelity and specificity by using the strand displacing DNA polymerases. The product of RCA is long single-stranded DNA that contains tandem repeat of target sequence. Isothermal reaction amplification condition of RCA has an advantage over conventional polymerase chain reaction, because no temperature cycling devices are needed for RCA. Thus, RCA is suitable tool for point-of-care detection of target nucleic acids as well as facile detection of target genes. Combined with various detection methods, RCA could amplify and detect femtomolar scale of target nucleic acids with a specificity of one or two base discrimination. Herein, RCA technology is reviewed with an emphasis on molecular diagnosis of microRNAs, infectious pathogens, and point mutations.

PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare Roux-en-Y (R-Y) reconstruction with Billroth-II (B-II) reconstruction after a totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG). METHODS Eighty-one consecutive TLDG procedures were performed by a single surgeon and subsequently examined. Postoperative outcomes, clinicopathologic features, and postoperative endoscopic findings between the 2 groups were evaluated and compared. RESULTS The mean operation time was not significantly higher in the R-Y than in the B-II group (P=0.396). Postoperative hospital stay was longer in the R-Y than in the B-II group (P=0.037). The severities of gastritis and bile reflux were reduced significantly in the R-Y group as compared with that in the B-II group (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the amount of residual food between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS R-Y reconstruction after TLDG appears to be a safe and feasible procedure, and is associated with a reduced severity of gastritis and bile reflux in the remnant stomach.

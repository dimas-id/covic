Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique which is commonly used to image surfaces at the nanoscale and single-molecule level, as well as to investigate physical properties of the sample surface using a technique known as force spectroscopy. In this chapter, we review our recent research where we used AFM to investigate physical properties of phospholipid monolayers, bilayers, and cell membranes. We describe the experimental procedures for AFM imaging, force measurements, and theoretical models to analyze force spectroscopy data. The data obtained allowed correlations between AFM topography and local adhesion and mechanoelastic properties of supported lipid bilayers in water, supported pulmonary surfactant films in air, and the plasma membrane of epithelial type II cells. Finally, AFM was applied to help elucidate the effect of anesthetics and cholesterol present in the lipid films.

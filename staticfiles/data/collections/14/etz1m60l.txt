PURPOSE OF REVIEW To discuss the automated risk calculators that have been developed and evaluated in orthopedic surgery. RECENT FINDINGS Identifying predictors of adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery is vital in the decision-making process for surgeons and patients. Recently, automated risk calculators have been developed to quantify patient-specific preoperative risk associated with certain orthopedic procedures. Automated risk calculators may provide the orthopedic surgeon with a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, informed consent, and the shared decision-making process with the patient. Understanding how an automated risk calculator was developed is arguably as important as the performance of the calculator. Additionally, conveying and interpreting the results of these risk calculators with the patient and its influence on surgical decision-making are paramount. The most abundant research on automated risk calculators has been conducted in the spine, total hip and knee arthroplasty, and trauma literature. Currently, many risk calculators show promise, but much research is still needed to improve them. We recommend they be used only as adjuncts to clinical decision-making. Understanding how a calculator was developed, and accurate communication of results to the patient, is paramount.

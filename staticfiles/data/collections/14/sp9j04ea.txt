We describe a new emergency interventional radiology approach in percutaneous procedure complications. We present the case of an 81-year-old male with small renal cancer, approached with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RTA) and complicated by pseudoaneurysm bleeding of a renal artery branch. In the emergency setting, pseudoaneurysm was treated in the CT room by the same RTA needle, without any complications or local tumor recurrence during the next 6-month follow-up.

OBJECTIVES Octreotide is a somatostatin analog, long-acting formulations of which have been used experimentally for the treatment of patients with invasive tumors and/or residual disease after conventional therapies. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) for the treatment of thymic tumors, with a primary efficacy end point of progression-free survival. METHODS Between 1994 and 2010, 44 patients with thymic malignancies were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients underwent an OctreoScan, and 12 OctreoScan-positive patients were treated with long-acting octreotide at a dose of 20 mg, given as an intramuscular injection, every 2 weeks. RESULTS Treatment with long-acting octreotide gave the following results: 3 cases of partial response (25%), 5 cases of stable disease (42%), and 4 cases of progressive disease (33%), with an average progression-free survival of 8 months (range, 3 to 21). Treatment compliance and tolerability were good for all evaluated patients. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study confirm the somatostatin receptor as a valid target for the treatment of thymic malignancies. Overall, therapy with long-acting somatostatin analogs seems to be safe and effective.

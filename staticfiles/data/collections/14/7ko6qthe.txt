The attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), derived from a wild strain (TW2575/98w) in chicken embryos after 75 passages, is designed as a commercial vaccine strain (TW2575/98vac) to control the disease in Taiwan. The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins. In addition, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.

Brain oscillatory activity from the midline prefrontal region has been shown to reflect brain dysfunction in subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). It is not known, however, whether electrodes from this area provide unique information about brain function in MDD. We examined a set of midline sites and two other prefrontal locations for detecting cerebral activity differences between subjects with MDD and healthy controls. Resting awake quantitative EEG (qEEG) data were recorded from 168 subjects: 47 never-depressed adults and 121 with a current major depressive episode. Individual midline electrodes (Fpz, Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz) and prefrontal electrodes outside the hairline (Fp1, Fp2) were examined with absolute and relative power and cordance in the theta band. We found that MDD subjects exhibited higher values of cordance (p = 0.0066) at Fpz than controls; no significant differences were found at other locations, and power measures showed trend-level differences. Depressed adults showed higher midline cordance than did never-depressed subjects at the most-anterior midline channel. Salient abnormalities in MDD may be detectable by focusing on the prefrontal midline region, and EEG metrics from focused electrode arrays may offer clinical practicality for clinical monitoring.

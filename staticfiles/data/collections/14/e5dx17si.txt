Peritonitis is a significant complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), contributing to mortality and technique failure. Suboptimal disinfection and/or a loose connection at the catheter adapter-transfer set junction are forms of touch contamination that can compromise the integrity of the sterile fluid path and lead to peritonitis. Proper use of the right disinfectants for connections at the PD catheter adapter-transfer set interface can help eliminate bacteria at surface interfaces, secure connections, and prevent bacteria from entering into the sterile fluid pathway. Three studies were conducted to assess the antibacterial effects of various disinfecting agents and procedures, and ensuing security of the catheter adapter-transfer set junction. An open-soak disinfection procedure with 10% povidone iodine improves disinfection and tightness/security of catheter adapter-transfer set connection.

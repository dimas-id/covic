We identified unusual rotavirus strains in fecal specimens from sheltered dogs in Hungary by viral metagenomics. The novel rotavirus species displayed limited genome sequence homology to representatives of the 8 rotavirus species, Aâ€“H, and qualifies as a candidate new rotavirus species that we tentatively named Rotavirus I.

Abstract Pharyngitis is an acute inflammatory infection of pharynx and/or tonsils, most cases are caused by viruses and occur as part of common cold syndromes. As there is marked overlap between clinical findings of viral and bacterial pharyngitis and it is difficult to distinguish GABHS from viral causes clinicians tend to prescribe antibiotics for any sore throat and therefore pharyngitis has become the raison d'Ãªtre for antibiotic misuses. Although clinical findings may not specifically differentiate the various pharyngitis pathogens yet many of these pathogens have clinical markers which could give us some clues to clinical suspicion. A good picture is equal to thousand words, believing in this axiom article presents few simple clinico-pictorial clues which could help suspecting pharyngitis pathogens, this in turn may boost clinical confidence to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

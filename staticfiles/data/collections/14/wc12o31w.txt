BACKGROUND Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. It is believed that BE is caused by chronic gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery (LARS) restores the competency of the cardia and may thereby change the natural course of BE. We studied the impact of LARS on the histological profile of BE and on the control of GERD. METHODS We identified all patients with BE who underwent LARS from 1994 to 2007 and contacted them to assess post-operative GERD symptoms via questionnaire. Endoscopy findings, histology, 24 hour pH monitoring, and manometry were also collected using our prospectively maintained database. Histological regression was defined as either loss of dysplasia or disappearance of BE. RESULTS Two hundred and fifteen patients met the initial inclusion criteria; in 82 of them histology from post-operative endoscopy was available for review. Endoscopy was performed a median of 8 years (range, 1-16 years) after surgery. Regression of BE occurred in 18 (22%) patients while in 6 (7%) BE progressed to dysplasia or cancer. Thirty-six (43%) patients underwent pre- and post-operative manometry. The median lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased from 9 to 17 mmHg in these patients. Thirty-four (41%) patients underwent pre- and post-operative pH studies. The median DeMeester score decreased from 54 to 9. Sixty-seven (82%) of 82 patients completed the post-operative questionnaire; 86% of these patients reported improvement in heartburn and regurgitation. CONCLUSIONS LARS was associated with both physiologic and symptomatic control of GERD in patients with BE. LARS resulted in regression of BE in 22% of patients and progression in 7%. Thus, continued surveillance of Barrett's is needed after LARS.

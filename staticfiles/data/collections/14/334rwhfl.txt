BACKGROUND Icodextrin, a glucose polymer with a polydispersity [ratio of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average molecular weight] of approximately 2.6, has been shown, compared with glucose, to provide superior ultrafiltration (UF) efficiency [ratio of UF to carbohydrate (CHO) absorbed] when used as an osmotic agent during a long-dwell peritoneal dialysis exchange. In an experimental rabbit model, we evaluated the effect of Mw on the UF and UF efficiency of glucose polymers with low polydispersity. METHODS A crossover trial in female New Zealand White rabbits (2.20 - 2.65 kg) with surgically implanted peritoneal catheters evaluated two glucose polymers at nominal concentrations of 7.5 g/dL: a 6K polymer (Mw: 6.4 kDa; polydispersity: 2.3) and a 19K polymer (Mw: 18.8 kDa; polydispersity: 2.0). Rabbits were randomized to receive either the 6K (n = 11) or the 19K (n = 12) solution during the first exchange (40 mL/kg body weight). The alternative solution was evaluated in a second exchange 3 days later. During each 4-hour dwell, the UF and total glucose polymer CHO absorbed were determined. RESULTS The UF was higher for the 6K (p < 0.0001) than for the 19K polymer (mean ± standard deviation: 73.6 ± 30.8 mL vs. 43.0 ± 20.2 mL), as was the amount of CHO absorbed (42.5% ± 9.8% vs. 35.7% ± 11.0%, p = 0.021). In spite of higher CHO absorption, an approximately 50% higher (p = 0.029) UF efficiency was achieved with the 6K polymer (28.3 ± 18.8 mL/g) than with the 19K polymer (19.0 ± 11.3 mL/g). The results were independent of the order of the experimental exchanges. CONCLUSIONS Glucose polymers with low polydispersity are effective osmotic agents in a rabbit model. The low-Mw polymer was more effective at generating UF and had a higher UF efficiency, but those results came at the expense of the polymer being more readily absorbed from the peritoneal cavity.

The current need for social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to social isolation in the older adult population. Social isolation contributes to multiple health problems for older adults residing in the community and residential care facilities. Mitigating the effects of social isolation requires a holistic approach, focusing interventions on the physical, psychological, and psychosocial needs of older adults. Nurses possess a unique expertise in developing holistic interventions and using creativity to counteract the negative health sequelae resulting from social isolation. The nursing role in holistic care serves to protect the older adult's ego integrity, improve quality of life, and maintain wellness during this time of mandated social distancing.

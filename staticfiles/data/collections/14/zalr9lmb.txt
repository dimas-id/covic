BACKGROUND Atraumatic fixation is a key element of modern hernia repair. Two different concepts of self-adhering meshes were directly compared in this study. Adhesix(®) (AH) is coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), whereas Parietene Progrip(®) (PP) relies on the mechanical principle of micro grips made of polylactic acid (PLA). These meshes are the main competitors in the field. METHODS AH and PP were tested in Sprague-Dawley rats at 14 and 90 days. Four groups were operated (n = 8 animals per group). Two meshes were implanted per animal in an operation model of onlay hernia repair. Dislocation, tissue integration and foreign-body reaction were evaluated. RESULTS AH dislocated significantly more frequently (every second mesh) at both time points of observation than PP. Tissue integration was good with PP and could not be reliably assessed in AH due to frequent dislocation. Histologic examination revealed only a mild foreign body reaction in all groups. CONCLUSIONS In our hands, PP (mechanical grip fixation) was superior to hydrogel fixation with PEG and PVP in AH in an onlay model. The reason for dislocation of AH requires further clarification as well as the impact of long-term degradation of the PLA grips.

Protein microarrays containing nearly the entire yeast proteome have been constructed. They are typically prepared by overexpression and high-throughput purification and printing onto microscope slides. The arrays can be used to screen nearly the entire proteome in an unbiased fashion and have enormous utility for a variety of applications. These include proteinâ€“protein interactions, identification of novel lipid- and nucleic acid-binding proteins, and finding targets of small molecules, protein kinases, and other modification enzymes. Protein microarrays are thus powerful tools for individual studies as well as systematic characterization of proteins and their biochemical activities and regulation.

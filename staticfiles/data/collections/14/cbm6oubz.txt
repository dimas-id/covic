Abstract A preliminary study was conducted to determine the cellular immune status of neonatal, colostrum-deprived calves following inoculation with either attenuated or virulent bovine coronavirus (BCV). Uninfected calves served as controls. To determine the intestinal and systemic cellular immune status, we performed MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) assay on mesenteric lymphocytes, enumerated T cell subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and examined histopathological alterations in mesenteric lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Target cells for the CTL assay were autologous testicular cells and effector cells were mesenteric lymphocytes from calves infected with BCV. No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The TC/TS population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo. The mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of calves inoculated with the virulent virus showed severe depletion of lymphocytes. These calves developed intestinal antibody responses in the acute phase of infection (1 week after infection) but were immunosuppressed in the later stage of infection.

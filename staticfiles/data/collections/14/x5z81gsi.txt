The rapid spread of COVID-19 global outbreak will inevitably pose great challenges for public health and medical care, especially for major concerns of public health such as HIV. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNAIDS is urging countries to remain steadfast in their HIV prevention efforts. Few studies of COVID-19 have been focused on marginalized populations, especially those with HIV infection. This study aims to review the studies and researches of COVID-19 among people living with HIV, covering the impacts of COVID-19 on their disease progression, HIV-related medical services, HIV epidemics, and measures on relieving the above-mentioned impacts, which might provide references for targeted scientific research and prevention practice of COVID-19 in HIV population, and optimizing prevention and treatment services in the context of this pandemic.

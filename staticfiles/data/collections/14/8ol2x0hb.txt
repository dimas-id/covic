Abstract Viruses may lead to serious and lethal pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised children. Series of children with acute respiratory distress syndrome and series of children requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, as well as reported series of nosocomial viral illness, offer an insight into the extent of serious viral disease documented in the medical literature. Series of children with specific viral respiratory illness also will be reviewed, as will the means of diagnosis in these groups of patients. Copyright Â© 2000 by W.B. Saunders Company

OBJECTIVE To describe our experience with a single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) performed using a flexible endoscope as the means of visualization and surgical dissection. The use of flexible endoscopy in intra-abdominal surgery has never been described. DESIGN Prospective observational case series. PATIENTS Eleven patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis were selected based on age, clinical presentation, body habitus, and history of previous abdominal surgery. Patients with acute or chronic cholecystitis were excluded. RESULTS All procedures were completed laparoscopically via the single umbilical incision without the need to convert to an open operation and without introduction of any additional laparoscopic instruments or trocars. The mean operative time was 149.5 minutes (range, 99-240 minutes). The mean length of hospital stay was 0.36 days. There were no associated intraoperative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, SILC performed with a flexible endoscope is feasible and safe. Further studies are needed to determine its advantages in reference to postoperative pain and complication rate in juxtaposition with the current standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

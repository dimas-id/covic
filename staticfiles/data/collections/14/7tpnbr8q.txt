Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is a disabling, aseptic and ischemic disease that develops following steroid therapy. The pathogenesis of SONFH is unclear, so the early diagnosis and treatment for this disease is yet to be established. The purpose of the present study was to identify potential biomarkers for SONFH. The differential expression of serum proteins from patients with SONFH and healthy volunteers was analyzed by the proteomics method. The protein samples were labeled and subjected to isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The resultant protein spots were matched and quantified by an imaging analysis system. The differentially-expressed protein spots were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Significantly lower levels of complement component 3 (C3), C4, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 and α-2-macroglobulin were found in the serum of patients with SONFH. These proteins are reported to be actively involved in intravascular coagulation, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species imbalance, indicating that multiple pathological reactions occur in SONFH and these proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of SONFH.

BACKGROUND: A retrospective study was conducted to summarize the clinical information of childhood infections during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. METHODS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 11 hospitals from three provinces of South China were included in the study. Clinical information was collected and compared with children and adults infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. RESULTS: In total, 52 children were enrolled, including 28 boys. The median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4-12); 44.2% cases were of clustered occurrences, 40.4% patients had fever, 48.1% had cough, and 46.2% had a high lymphocyte count. No abnormalities were found in the liver and kidney function. Also, 82.7% of patients received antiviral therapy, but such therapy did not shorten the time to virus negativity or hospital stay (P = .082). The time to virus negativity was 12.0 days (IQR, 8.0-16.8) and hospital stay was 14.5 days (IQR, 10.3-17.9). Compared with reports in Wuhan, there were more acute upper respiratory tract infection (AURTI) and fewer pneumonia cases (P = .000). Compared with the non-ICU adult COVID-19 in Wuhan, these children's diseases were relatively mild, with fewer complications. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a mild fever, lymphocyte elevation was more common than reduction, and antiviral treatment had no obvious effect. The overall clinical manifestations were mild, and the prognosis was good.

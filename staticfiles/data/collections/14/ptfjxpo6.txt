Background: Human parvovirus B19 (B19) is a ubiquitous pathogen, normally causing a mild self‐limiting disease, but also capable of causing both significant pathology and long‐term persistence. The small size and stability of the virus makes it suitable for mapping of the full breath and the kinetics of the cellular immune responses following acute viral infection. Methods: Five patients with acute primary B19 infection were included in the study and followed consecutively for up to 200 weeks. Cellular immune responses were mapped by IFNγ enzyme‐linked immunospot to overlapping peptides spanning the whole B19 genome. Results: In all five acutely infected patients, we were able to monitor the kinetics of a strong specific cellular immune reaction. Responses peaked at levels of 850–1850 SFC/million PBMCs, roughly corresponding to 0.3–0.6% B19‐specific CD8(+) cells circulating in peripheral blood at 10–80 weeks post‐infection. The responses in individual patients were directed to three or four different peptide pools, and the specificity was confined to the same CD8 epitopes present in the pools throughout the follow‐up period. The majority of responses were directed to the virus nonstructural protein, only two patients showed any response to the capsid proteins, elicited by the same epitope in both cases. Conclusion: The cellular immune responses to acute B19 infection are surprisingly narrow in distribution and remain at high levels for up to 80 weeks post‐infection. The initial epitope specificity is maintained, and the majority of responses target the virus nonstructural protein, which is not included in vaccine preparations, evaluated against the infection.

According to the current state of knowledge, several internal organs are usually involved in cases of SARS-CoV‑2 infections with a fatal course. Pathological changes are primarily found in lung tissues but there are also reports concerning direct or indirect (histo)pathological changes due to SARS-CoV‑2 infections in samples from the kidneys, liver and myocardium. Comparing three fatal cases associated with SARS-CoV‑2 infections in men using conventional histological staining, there were partly identical findings that enabled interpretations with respect to the chronology and pathophysiology of the disease. Of the men two were invasively ventilated in the intensive care unit and one man died after 8 days in domestic quarantine without treatment. A wide spectrum of findings potentially associated with SARS-CoV‑2 must be taken into account.

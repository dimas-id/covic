Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a variety of diseases in humans. Some coronaviruses cause only mild illnesses like the common cold. While, some coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (SARS-associated coronavirus) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have, in recent years, been able to cause severe respiratory involvement (pneumonia), leading to death in several patients. By identifying the genomic sequence of the new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) it has been revealed that it belongs to the beta coronavirus genus. COVID-19 appears to be transmitted by a mechanism similar to the influenza virus via person to person, sneezing coughing, or contact with the secretions of infected patients. Early symptoms of these respiratory viruses include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with an incubation period of 2-14 days. SARS-CoV-2 is an acute respiratory disease that initially causes lung damage. SARS-CoV-2 can affect other organs, including the kidneys. Kidney damage may be caused by alterations that occur during coronavirus infection. It seems that low-oxygen delivery to tissues like the kidney in the setting of this disease may lead to ischemic damage of the kidney. Considering the importance of the kidneys, as one, this review study aimed to investigate the effect of the new coronavirus on the kidneys and its role in the development of renal failure.

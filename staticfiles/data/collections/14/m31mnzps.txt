Abstract Fucoidans are sulfated polysaccharides from brown algae, known to have immunomodulatory activity. Their effects on the response of airway epithelial cells to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation have not been characterized. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of a marine-sourced fucoidan solution (MFS) on the TLR3-induced expression and/or production of cytokines and prostaglandin by human primary bronchial epithelial cells as a model of the airway epithelium. The cells were incubated with MFS in the presence or absence of Poly(I:C) (a TLR3 agonist that mimics viral RNA). Cytokine expression and production were assessed using RT-qPCR and ELISA. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 were also measured. Relative to control, exposure to MFS was associated with lower Poly(I:C)-induced mRNA expression of various cytokines and chemokines, and lower COX-2 production. The MFS inhibited the production of some cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6), chemokines (CCL5, CCL22, CXCL1, CXCL5 and CXCL8) and prostaglandin E2 but did not alter the production of IL-12/25, CCL2 and CCL20. At clinically relevant concentrations, the MFS inhibited the TLR3-mediated production of inflammatory mediators by human primary bronchial epithelial cells - suggesting that locally applied MFS might help to reduce airway inflammation in viral infections.

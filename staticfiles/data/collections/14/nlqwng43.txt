OBJECTIVE To observe the application and the roles of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS To analyze retrospectively the data of NIPPV in 105 SARS cases hospitalized from 8 Apr to 14 May, 2003. To generalize the indication, parameter adjustment, treatment effects, side effects and affection rate of the medical faculty. RESULTS The total number of the patients was 105. Among them 24 patients accepted NIPPV, 5 patients died. The mortality was 4.7%, which was lower than the average rate of our country. The most common side effect was subcutaneous emphysema, of which the incidence rate was 16.7%. There was no SARS affected among the medical faculty during the course of NIPPV. CONCLUSION NIPPV is a safe and effective method for the treatment of the severe SARS. The proper application of NIPPV could decrease the chance of the invasive ventilation and decrease the affective rate of the medical faculty.

Abstract Data about the development of plant-made peroral vaccines are stated on the base of transgenic plants. Different aspects of plant made vaccines (PMV) with their peculiarities and with a plethora of advantages are discussed, in comparison with traditional vaccines. The results disclosing the characteristics of the creation of PMV of both preventive and therapeutic actions are presented. The role of regulatory genes in the increase of the production of antigenic proteins, and in the activation of the glycosylation that enhances the efficiency of PMV, is discussed, according to preventive and therapeutic vaccines and plantibodies.

BACKGROUND A gastric pouch in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery can be created after transection of the perigastric neurovascular bundle or by preserving these structures. Some surgeons choose to transect the neurovascular bundle (NBT), containing branches of the vagus nerve, because this might be related to additional weight loss, whereas others advocate preservation (NBP) to reduce postoperative complications. OBJECTIVES This study assessed the effect of both techniques after primary RYGB. SETTING All patients undergoing primary RYGB in a large bariatric center in the Netherlands between January 2010 and December 2013 were included. METHODS Patient demographic characteristics, operative details, postoperative complications and weight loss after 1 year were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS A total of 773 consecutive patients were included (85.5% female). NBT was performed in 407 patients (52.7%), whereas NBP was performed in 366 patients. There were no missing data and 81.2% of patients completed the 1-year follow-up. Postoperative complications were found in 66 patients (8.5%). A total of 49 patients (6.3%) either had an anastomotic leakage, postoperative bleeding, or intraabdominal abscess (NBT 8.8% versus NBP 3.6%, P = .003). Percentage total weight loss (NBT 34.5%±6.9% versus NBP 33.4%±6.9%; P = .011) differed to a lesser extent between groups, although this was significant. Neurovascular bundle transection was identified as independent factor among others for occurrence of leakage, bleeding, and abscess development (OR 2.886; 95% CI [1.466-5.683]; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS Transection of the neurovascular bundle in RYGB is associated with more complications. Furthermore, weight loss is not relevantly increased. Further research is necessitated to substantiate these findings.

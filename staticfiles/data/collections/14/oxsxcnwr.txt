BACKGROUND:: In response to the evolving nature of potential disasters, both human made and natural, this research identifies predictors of individual emergency preparedness and compliance with government requests. METHODS:: A survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults (1629 respondents) revealed which emergency supplies and plans they had in place; their perceived level of preparedness and that of their local health care system; the likelihood of 7 terrorist and 4 naturally occurring events, whether they would evacuate their home; shelter in place at home and work; be quarantined, vaccinated, or take medication; and whether they believed that these actions would increase their chances for survival. RESULTS:: Having supplies was predicted by being male, older, wealthier, and white, living in the western United States, and being exposed to national news. Having plans was related to living in the western United States, having children, and being exposed to national news. Compliance was associated with being female and ill. Holding demographic factors constant, preparedness and compliance with government requests were associated with the perceived likelihood of a natural but not a terrorist event, the perceived efficacy of requested actions, and belief in one's local health care system. CONCLUSIONS:: A focus on natural as opposed to terrorist events and people's perceived efficacy of emergency actions and local health care systems may increase their preparedness and compliance with government requests.

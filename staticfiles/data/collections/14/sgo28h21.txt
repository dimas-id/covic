Organosulfur compounds (OSCs) of garlic have various health benefits including anti-hypertensive effect. It has been described that volatile OSCs uptake occurs into a moderate extent. Among the bioavailable OSCs present in garlic, 2-vinyl-4H-1,3-dithiin (2VD) is a main component in garlic macerated oil and stir-fried garlic but has been poorly investigated compared with others OSCs, such allyl mercaptan (AM) and S-allyl cysteine (SAC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2VD on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and compare them with those produced by AM and SAC. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using tetrazolium dye MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated by scrape-wound migration assay. OSCs anti-oxidative capacity was determined by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and total antioxidant status (TAS). Non-toxic plasmatic concentrations (10 Âµg L-1) of 2VD and AM inhibited VSMCs proliferation stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum and impaired cell migration. In further flow cytometry analysis 2VD treatment resulted in a partial cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. The OSCs tested were able to prevent ROS increase after angiotensin II stimulation and surprisingly 2VD induced higher total antioxidant status compared with AM and SAC. Our results showed that 2VD produces equivalent or superior beneficial effects on VSMCs to those reported for other bioavailable compounds of garlic. This preliminary evidence suggests that 2VD intake could also exert important protective effects against arterial remodeling in hypertension.

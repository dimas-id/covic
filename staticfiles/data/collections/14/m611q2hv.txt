A 57-year-old male presented with intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) 1 year after a successful simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplant. No source could be found after 5 tagged red blood cell studies, 3 computed tomographies (CTs), 7 endoscopies, and 4 catheter angiograms. Review of CTs showed pathologically enlarged superior mesenteric vein branches near a jejunal segment near pancreas graft. Transhepatic superior mesenteric venogram showed varicosities near jejunum, which were obliterated with ethylene vinyl alcohol (Onyx). Follow-up CTs confirmed complete obliteration, but he had more GIBs and eventually underwent native jejunal and donor duodenal resection. He has remained GIB-free for 12 months.

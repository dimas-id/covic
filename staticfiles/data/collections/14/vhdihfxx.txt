Serologically coronavirus free kittens were placed in 2 catteries with a history of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), each cattery representing 1 of the 2 different predominant clinical characteristics of FIP--effusive and granulomatous. The kittens were clinically observed for 100 days. A 100% morbidity and a 90% mortality was observed. The first signs were observed after 14 and 27 days respectively. The clinical pattern of the disease was similar in all kittens and showed a pattern of recurrent periods of conjunctivitis, upper respiratory and gastrointestinal signs. Once developed, wasting and signs of CNS disturbances were consistent. The "effusive strain" had a 2 weeks earlier onset of signs and death, and a 40% outcome of effusive FIP. Mean survival times during the observation period were 57 +/- 26 and 57 +/- 16 (mean +/- SD in days), respectively. The death rates were similar in both groups. Feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen was immunohistochemically detected using indirect immunofluorescence and was present in all kittens and in 93% of the 5 investigated organs (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and mesenteric lymph node).

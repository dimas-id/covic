Publisher Summary Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN). DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin receptor that recognizes N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides and branched fucosylated structures. It is now clear that the biological role of DC-SIGN is two-fold. It is primarily expressed by dendritic cells and mediates important functions necessary for the induction of successful immune responses that are essential for the clearance of microbial infections, such as the capture, destruction, and presentation of microbial pathogens to induce successful immune responses. Yet, on the other hand, pathogens may also exploit DC-SIGN to modulate DC functioning thereby skewing the immune response and promoting their own survival. This chapter presents an overview of the structure of DC-SIGN and its expression pattern among immune cells. The current state of knowledge of DC-SIGN-carbohydrate interactions is discussed and how these interactions influence dendritic cell functioning is examined. The molecular aspects that underlie the selectivity of DC-SIGN for mannose-and fucose-containing carbohydrates are detailed. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the role of DC-SIGN in dendritic cell biology and how certain bacterial pathogens exploit DC-SIGN to escape immune surveillance.

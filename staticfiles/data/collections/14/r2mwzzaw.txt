As many countries reached the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, there is debate on how to reopen the economy without causing a significant resurgence. Here we show, using a microsimulation model, that how to reopen safely depends on what percentage of COVID-19 cases can be detected by testing. The higher the detection rate, the less restrictive the reopen plan needs to be. If 70% of cases can be detected, schools and businesses can reopen if 2-layer quarantine is imposed on each confirmed case. Our results suggest that increasing the detection rate is essential to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19.

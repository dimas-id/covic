Ethical issues, along with transparency, disinformation, and bias, are in the focus of our information society. In this work, we propose the bias goggles model, for computing the bias characteristics of web domains to user-defined concepts based on the structure of the web graph. For supporting the model, we exploit well-known propagation models and the newly introduced Biased-PR PageRank algorithm, that models various behaviours of biased surfers. An implementation discussion, along with a preliminary evaluation over a subset of the greek web graph, shows the applicability of the model even in real-time for small graphs, and showcases rather promising and interesting results. Finally, we pinpoint important directions for future work. A constantly evolving prototype of the bias goggles system is readily available.

Abstract During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003, patients were treated with very high doses of corticosteroid and ribarivin. The detrimental effects of such treatment on the bone mineral density (BMD) of SARS patients are unknown. To compare the BMD of SARS patients with normal range data, a cross-sectional survey was conducted. The bone mineral density of 224 patients with SARS, who were treated with an average of 2753 mg (SD = 2152 mg) prednisolone and 29,344 mg (SD = 15,849 mg) of ribarivin was compared to normal data. Six percent of men had a hip BMD Z score of ≤−2 (P = 0.057 for testing the hypothesis that >2.5% of subjects should have a Z score of ≤−2). Moreover, there was a negative association (r = −0.25, P = 0.023) between the duration of steroid therapy and BMD in men. We conclude that male SARS patients had lower BMD at the hip than normal controls, and this could be attributed to prolonged steroid therapy.

The particular anatomic location of the hepatic caudate lobe between the hilar plate and inferior vena cava means that it is still considered unsuitable for laparoscopic measures and a difficult site even for conventional surgery. Here we describe the first case to be reported in the literature of caudate lobe resection for a single metastasis from breast adenocarcinoma that was completed using an exclusively laparoscopic procedure and a simplified scheme involving the placement of 4 trocars, without any need for conversion or the Pringle maneuver. The patient was 31 years old with a history of radical right mastectomy and chemotherapy. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged 4 days after the surgery. Twelve months on, she is currently alive and disease free.

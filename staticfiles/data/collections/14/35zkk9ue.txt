Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism, in an exaggerated immune response to the virus, especially in severe patients. Even though aortic clots are a rare entity, the pro-coagulant nature of COVID-19 is associated with thrombosis in atypical locations and should be considered in patients with severe abnormalities in coagulation parameters. We describe a series of three cases of aortic thrombi diagnosed by computerized tomography (CT) angiography in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

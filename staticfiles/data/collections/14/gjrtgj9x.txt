A novel simultaneous detection system for human viruses was developed using a real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system to identify causes of infection in clinical samples from patients with uncertain diagnoses. This system, designated as the “multivirus real‐time PCR,” has the potential to detect 163 human viruses (47 DNA viruses and 116 RNA viruses) in a 96‐well plate simultaneously. The specificity and sensitivity of each probe–primer set were confirmed with cells or tissues infected with specific viruses. The multivirus real‐time PCR system showed profiles of virus infection in 20 autopsies of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients, and detected frequently TT virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, and Epstein–Barr virus in various organs; however, RNA viruses were detected rarely except for human immunodeficiency virus‐1. Pathology samples from 40 patients with uncertain diagnoses were examined, including cases of encephalitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis. Herpes simplex virus 1, human herpesvirus 6, and parechovirus 3 were identified as causes of diseases in four cases of encephalitis, while no viruses were identified in other cases as causing disease. This multivirus real‐time PCR system can be useful for detecting virus in specimens from patients with uncertain diagnoses. J. Med. Virol. 83:322–330, 2011. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

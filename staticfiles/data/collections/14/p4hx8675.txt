Abstract Recently, indoor air quality (IAQ) has become an important issue as it affects people's comfort and health. To mitigate the problem, application of some innovative air filtering devices has been generally recognized as one of the effective ways. This study adopted an action research-dominated approach to test whether the indoor air quality in the tested hotel rooms meets the recognized standard, and measure the pollutant removal efficiency of three types of air purifiers. Focus group discussion was carried out to ascertain the difference in hotel managers’ understanding of indoor air quality research before the experiment and management response after the experiment. The result of field test indicates that the actual performance of the purifiers is not as good as the manufactures claim. The management response study also ascertains that hotel department heads’ awareness, exposure and training in relation to IAQ testing is limited.

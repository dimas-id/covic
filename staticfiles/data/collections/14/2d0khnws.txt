INTRODUCTION In recent years, attention has been given to the development of abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant opioid formulations in light of concern over the growing misuse and abuse of opioids prescribed for the treatment of chronic pain. AREAS COVERED This critical review discusses abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant formulations, which may help to overcome concerns of misuse in using opioids for pain management. The role and utility of these novel formulations in clinical practice are outlined, as well as the risks and benefits associated with formulations that are currently available or under development. EXPERT OPINION Numerous concerns with the integration of these formulations into clinical practice remain, as no product is intended or capable of addressing all types of misuse or abuse. As a result, these formulations should not necessarily be considered preferred agents once available in clinical practice. Moreover, before initiating therapy with abuse-deterrent and tamper-resistant formulations, proper patient assessment to identify risk factors for misuse and abuse should be implemented and optimized. With screening and monitoring in place, it would then be sensible to consider these formulations in patients who appear to be at high risk of misuse, abuse and/or diversion.

The incidence of popliteal vessel injuries is low, even in busy urban trauma centers. As a result of this fact, few trauma centers and trauma surgeons have developed extensive experience in the management of these injuries. Popliteal vessel injuries in both civilian and military arenas incur significant morbidity. These injuries present a difficult challenge, and, although the overall incidence of these injuries remains low, the sequelae can be devastating. Successful outcomes for limb salvage and survival result from early recognition and rapid surgical intervention by a multidisciplinary approach with a great participation of different surgical specialties. From the historical perspective, anatomy, incidence and associated injuries, to the clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and morbidity and mortality, the aim of this article is to review the various aspects of these complex injuries.

BACKGROUND A laparoscopic spleen preserving surgical approach is preferred for the management of symptomatic non-parasitic splenic cysts. The aim of this study was to review our experience with managing this rare presentation. METHODS A retrospective review of all cases of splenic cysts was performed over a 10-year period (2001-2011). Demographic data, clinical history, investigations, operative details and the outcome of each case were reviewed with an emphasis on patients who underwent laparoscopic stapled cyst excision. RESULTS Eleven cases were identified. Seven patients were managed surgically; six by laparoscopic stapled cyst excision and one by open excision of remnant splenic tissue. Laparoscopic management was successful in all six cases and radiological and clinical follow-up (median: 28 months) revealed no evidence of cyst recurrence in five of six cases. One patient developed an asymptomatic, non-progressing and small recurrent anterior cyst and she continues to be observed. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic stapled splenic cyst excision can be performed safely and is particularly effective for large superficial non-parasitic cysts. This technique allows spleen preservation with a low cyst recurrence rate. However, it may not be suitable for deeper intraparenchymal splenic cysts. Further studies are required to refine the management of specific subtypes of non-parasitic splenic cysts.

BACKGROUND MRI-guided laparoscopic assisted anorectoplasty (MRI-LAARP), a new approach for surgical correction of high imperforate anus, does not bisect the sphincter complex as in the PSARP and is able to pull the neorectum through the entire sphincter complex unlike the LAARP. There is no available MRI-compatible device to position and transport patients during this procedure. We report on the design of such a device here. METHODS AND DEVICE The device was constructed from 1.0″ polyvinylchloride tubing and poly-methyl methacrylate (Plexiglass(®)) platform. The device has a stable, rigid base on which platform is secure. An adjustable and removable superstructure is secured to this base to suspend legs for lithotomy position. RESULTS MRI-LAARP has been performed on 6 patients. The device has performed well and meets requirements set forth in development including construction with MRI-compatible materials, size fitting in the MRI bore, ability to hold patient in lithotomy position, ability to position and support MRI flex coils, and providing stability while transporting to a separate OR with needle in position. CONCLUSIONS This device provides a stable structure to position and transport a patient with a needle in a tenuous position without dislodgement allowing this procedure, and potentially other procedures, to be done in hospitals without MROR capability.

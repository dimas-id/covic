The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness with heterogenous clinical manifestations, ranging from mild symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. The global healthcare community is rapidly learning more about the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system, as well as the strategies for management of infected patients with cardiovascular disease. There is minimal literature available surrounding the relationship between COVID-19 infection and acute coronary syndrome. We describe the case of a woman who presented with an acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction managed by primary percutaneous coronary intervention, who subsequently developed severe COVID-19 infection and ultimately succumbed to multisystem organ failure.

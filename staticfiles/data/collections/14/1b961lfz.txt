Autologous vascular grafts are widely used in revascularization surgeries for small caliber targets. However, the availability of autologous conduits might be limited due to prior surgeries or the quality of vessels. Xenogeneic decellularized vascular grafts from animals potentially substitute for autologous vascular grafts. Decellularization with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is reported to highly preserve extracellular matrix (ECM) which would be feasible for recellularization and vascular remodeling after implantation. In the present study, we conducted xenogeneic implantation of HHP-decellularized bovine vascular grafts from dorsalis pedis arteries to porcine carotid arteries then evaluated graft patency, ECM preservation and recellularization. Surgical procedure not to damage luminal surface of the grafts from drying significantly increased the graft patency at 4 weeks after implantation (P = 0.0079). After the technical improvement, all grafts (N = 5) were patent with mild stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia at 4 weeks after implantation. Neither aneurysmal change nor massive thrombosis was observed even without administration of anticoagulants nor anti-platelet agents. Elastica van Gieson and Sirius-red stainings revealed fair preservation of ECM proteins including elastin and collagen after implantation. Luminal surface of grafts was thoroughly covered with von Willebrand factor-positive endothelium. Scanning electron microscopy on luminal surface of implanted grafts exhibited cobblestone-like endothelial cell layer which is similar to native vascular endothelium. Recellularization of tunica media with alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive smooth muscle cells was partly observed. Thus, we confirmed that HHP-decellularized grafts are feasible for xenogeneic implantation accompanied by recellularization by recipient cells.

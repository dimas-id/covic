The consensus to date is that most infants and children only have mild COVID-19 symptoms and few require intensive care. However, there are some described exceptions and this brief report looks at a set of preterm twins born at the University Children's Hospital in Uppsala Sweden. The girl only had mild respiratory symptoms and stayed 24-hours at the paediatric ward and was then cared for at home, but the boy required intensive care and invasive ventilatory support.

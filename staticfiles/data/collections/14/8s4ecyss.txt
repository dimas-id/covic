Parents of children with Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (NDDs) are at risk of sleep loss. No comprehensive systematic reviews examining parental sleep outcomes in caregivers of children with NDDs exist. A systematic search was conducted between June and August 2016 examining sleep quantity, quality, sleepiness, and fatigue outcomes of caregivers of children with NDDs. Of 7,534 citations retrieved, 33 met eligibility criteria. Most studies ( n = 27) were cross-sectional, included a range of NDDs and were of "poor" ( n = 14) or "fair" ( n = 17) quality. Few good quality studies compared objectively measured sleep in parents of children with NDDs with parents with typically developing children. Parents of children with NDDs consistently reported significantly poorer subjective sleep quality. There is a paucity of good quality comparative studies, using well-validated measures, examining parental sleep outcomes. Future research should aim to fill this gap, providing greater insight to parents' experiences, and identifying targets for intervention design and evaluation.

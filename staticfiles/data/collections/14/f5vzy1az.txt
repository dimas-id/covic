BACKGROUND Surgical management of gastrointestinal fistulae has been reported to carry a 30-day morbidity rate up to 82% and a mortality rate ranging from 2% to 4.8%; thus nonoperative alternatives are required. The aim of the present study was to assess the current experience on the use of cyanoacrylates in the management of these fistulae. METHODS A systematic review was carried out on Medline, Embase, The Cochrane database, Academic Search Complete, MedicLatina, and SciELO for English, Spanish, and Portuguese articles dealing with refractory fistulae by means of cyanoacrylate embolization therapy. Publication dates were restricted from 1969 to present. Outcome parameters were study design, number of participants, etiology of the fistula, approach, material used, success rate, complications, and mortality. RESULTS Electronic search yielded a total of 377 articles. After a meticulous screening, only 14 studies dealing with foregut/midgut fistulae and 6 addressing hindgut fistulae were included. All the included articles were prospective and retrospective case series. Cumulative success rate was 81% (range 0% to 100%) and 3 out of 203 patients (1%) developed minor complications. CONCLUSION Cyanoacrylate embolization of nearly all types of refractory gastrointestinal fistulae is a feasible and harmless technique. Prospective controlled studies are required to support the available evidence.

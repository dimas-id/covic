The analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified mouse hepatitis virus type 3 revealed the presence of five polypeptides, three of them contained carbohydrate. The molecular weight of these proteins was 190,000 daltons (VGP(100)), 100,000 (VGP(100)), 58,000 (VP(58)), 25,000 (VP(25)) and 24,000 (VGP(24)). The analysis of particles obtained after limited proteolysis with bromelain suggests that VGP(190) and VGP(100) form the spike layer, that VP(25) and VGP(24) are membrane-associated and that VP(58) represents the inner core polypeptide.

OBJECTIVES AND WORKING HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the prevalence of respiratory viruses Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae and gain insight into their seasonal circulation pattern in children with acute asthma exacerbations in a temperate southern hemisphere region. STUDY DESIGN: Patients hospitalized between 3 months and 16 years of age were included in a 1‐year prospective, observational, cross‐sectional study. Respiratory secretions were collected and the presence of different viruses and atypical bacteria analyzed by immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Two hundred nine patients (118 females) aged (mean ± SD) 4.4 ± 4 years were included. A potential causative agent was detected in 78% of the patients. The most frequently detected viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) (n = 85; 40%) and rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 52; 24.5%); M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were detected in 4.5% and 2% of the cases, respectively. Patients with HRSV (vs. HRV) were hospitalized for a longer time (6.7 vs. 5.2 days, P = 0.012), required more days of oxygen supply (5.1 vs. 3.4, P = 0.005), had a longer duration of the exacerbation before hospitalization (3.6 vs. 1.9 days, P = 0.001) and were younger (3.7 vs. 5.1 years, P = 0.012). Three peaks of admissions were observed. A first peak (early autumn) caused by HRV, a second peak (winter) caused mainly by HRSV and a third one (spring), caused by HRSV, an increase in HMPV together with a second outbreak of HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an acute asthma exacerbation presented a high prevalence of respiratory viruses. Most hospitalizations corresponded to seasonal increases in prevalence of HRV and HRSV.

Candidates for OLT must have irreversible acute or chronic end stage liver disease (table 41b.1). Virus or alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis constitute the most common disease indications in adults [1] (fig. 41b.1). In our department 28% of cirrhotic liver transplant recipients are transplanted for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease and 26% undergo OLT for alcohol-related liver disease. Other indications include cholestatic liver disorders [primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), biliary atresia], hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, autoimmune hepatitis, cystic fibrosis, inherited metabolic diseases (Wilsonâ€™s disease, hemochromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, nonmetastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute virally-, toxin-, or drug-induced hepatic failure. The most common indications in children comprise biliary atresia and metabolic liver diseases

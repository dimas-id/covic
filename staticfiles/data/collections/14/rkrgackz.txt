INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic hilar cholangiocarcinoma is rarely performed because of its aggressive growth and complicated anatomy. The authors successfully performed single-incision laparoscopic resection of Bismuth I hilar cholangiocarcinoma in 2 cases. METHOD Two cases with Bismuth I cholangiocarcinoma were chosen for the laparoscopic surgery. Segmental bile duct resection and hepatoduodenal ligament lymphadenectomy were performed using single-incision laparoscopic technique with conventional instruments. RESULTS Two operations were successfully performed without conversion. The operation time was 300 and 350 minutes, respectively. The margins of proximal and distal bile ducts were negative. The hospital stay was 6 and 9 days, respectively. One dosage of analgesic was administered after surgery. The abdominal wound recovered very well with good cosmesis. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic surgery cholangiocarcinoma resection can be optional in strictly selected patients with Bismuth I cholangiocarcinoma. Long-term follow-up and more data are needed to evaluate its benefits.

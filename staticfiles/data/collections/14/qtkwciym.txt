The question on whether SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, Covid-19) can be harboured in testes and/or the semen is currently unanswered. It is essential to understand the limitations of both antibody and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests in interpreting SARS-CoV-2 data in relation to semen and testicular tissues analyses without appropriate controls. Here we critically analyse the evidence so far and the possible implications. The diagnostic test limitations posed in both sampling and testing methodologies, their validation, and relevancy in interpreting data are also highlighted.

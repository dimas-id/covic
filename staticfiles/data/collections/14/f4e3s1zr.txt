PURPOSE OF REVIEW The decision to proceed with anesthesia for the child with an upper respiratory tract infection is often difficult. Whereas most studies suggest that children who present for elective procedures with an upper respiratory tract infection are at increased risk of perioperative adverse events, these events are typically easy to recognize and treat. This review will discuss the current literature regarding outcome in children who present for elective surgery with an upper respiratory tract infection and suggests approaches to optimize their perioperative management. RECENT FINDINGS Although the literature regarding this important topic has been slow to evolve, recent large-scale outcome studies have identified a number of factors that increase the risk of perioperative adverse events among children with upper respiratory tract infections. The significance of these findings will be discussed. SUMMARY An understanding of the risk factors associated with administering anesthesia to the child with an upper respiratory tract infection is important in identifying elements of the preoperative assessment that merit attention and in optimizing the anesthetic plan as a means to limit any perioperative complications.

BACKGROUND Despite new improvements on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), brain damage is very often after resuscitation. OBJECTIVE To assess the prognostic value of cerebral oxygen saturation measurement (rSO2) for assessing prognosis on patients after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. DESIGN Retrospective analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We analyzed 25 post-CPR patients (12 female and 13 male). All the patients were cooled to a target temperature of 33-34°C. The Glascow Coma Scale (GCS), Corneal Reflexes (CR), Pupillary Reflexes (PR), arterial Base Excess (BE) and rSO2 measurements were taken on admission. The rewarming GCS, CR, PR, BE and rSO2 measurements were made after the patient's temperature reached 36°C. RESULTS In survivors, the baseline rSO2 value was 67.5 (46-70) and the percent difference between baseline and rewarming rSO2 value was 0.03 (0.014-0.435). In non-survivors, the baseline rSO2 value was 30 (25-65) and the percent difference between baseline and rewarming rSO2 value was 0.031 (-0.08 to -20). No statistical difference was detected on percent changes between baseline and rewarming values of rSO2. Statistically significant difference was detected between baseline and rewarming GCS groups (p=0.004). No statistical difference was detected between GCS, CR, PR, BE and rSO2 to determine the prognosis. CONCLUSION Despite higher values of rSO2 on survivors than non-survivors, we found no statistically considerable difference between groups on baseline and the rewarming rSO2 values. Since the measurement is simple, and not affected by hypotension and hypothermia, the rSO2 may be a useful predictor for determining the prognosis after CPR.

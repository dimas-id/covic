Since the first report of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, no standard treatment guideline has been set despite the virulence of MERS-coronavirus (CoV) and the high case-fatality rate. The outbreak in South Korea in 2015 demonstrates that MERS outbreaks can occur outside of the Middle East. The combination of ribavirin and interferon-Î± has been the most widely used therapy for this infection. However, due to the varying results of treatment with these drugs, a new antiviral combination regimen is urgently needed. This is a case report of use of lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination antiviral therapy for a patient with MERS-CoV infection.

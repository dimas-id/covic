BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Bats are recognized as important reservoirs for emerging infectious disease and some unknown viral diseases. Two novel viruses, Malsoor virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus, Phlebovirus) and a novel adenovirus (AdV) (family, Adenoviridae genus, Mastadenovirus), were identified from Rousettus bats in the Maharashtra State of India. This study was done to develop and optimize real time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for Malsoor virus and real time and nested PCR for adenovirus from Rousettus bats. METHODS: For rapid and accurate screening of Malsoor virus and adenovirus a nested polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan-based real-time PCR were developed. Highly conserved region of nucleoprotein gene of phleboviruses and polymerase gene sequence from the Indian bat AdV isolate polyprotein gene were selected respectively for diagnostic assay development of Malsoor virus and AdV. Sensitivity and specificity of assays were calculated and optimized assays were used to screen bat samples. RESULTS: Molecular diagnostic assays were developed for screening of Malsoor virus and AdV and those were found to be specific. Based on the experiments performed with different parameters, nested PCR was found to be more sensitive than real-time PCR; however, for rapid screening, real-time PCR can be used and further nested PCR can be used for final confirmation or in those laboratories where real-time facility/expertise is not existing. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the development and optimization of nested RT-PCR and a TaqMan-based real-time PCR for Malsoor virus and AdV. The diagnostic assays can be used for rapid detection of these novel viruses to understand their prevalence among bat population.

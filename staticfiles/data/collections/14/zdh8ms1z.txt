Similar to other epidemics, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread very fast and infected almost two hundreds countries around the globe since December 2019. The unique characteristics of the COVID-19 include its ability of faster expansion through freely existed viruses or air molecules in the atmosphere. Assuming that the spread of virus follows a random process instead of deterministic. The continuous time Markov Chain (CTMC) through stochastic model approach has been utilized for predicting the impending states with the use of random variables. The proposed study is devoted to investigate a model consist of three exclusive compartments. The first class includes white nose based transmission rate (termed as susceptible individuals), the second one pertains to the infected population having the same perturbation occurrence and the last one isolated (quarantined) individuals. We discuss the model’s extinction as well as the stationary distribution in order to derive the the sufficient criterion for the persistence and disease’ extinction. Lastly, the numerical simulation is executed for supporting the theoretical findings.

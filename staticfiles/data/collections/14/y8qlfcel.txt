BACKGROUND Although screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is a widely accepted concept nationally and screening rates are increasing, there are differences in screening rates between states and within states. METHODS In an effort to increase screening rates and ensure equal access with respect to race/ethnicity, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene formed a coalition of stakeholders in 2003, with its primary focus on colonoscopy, to develop and implement strategies across the city to achieve this goal. RESULTS From a screening colonoscopy rate of only 42% in 2003, these concerted efforts contributed to achieving a screening rate of 62% by 2007 and a screening rate of almost 70% in 2014 with the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities. CONCLUSIONS This article provides details of how this program was successfully conceived, implemented, and sustained in the large urban population of New York City. The authors hope that by sharing the many elements involved and the lessons learned, they may help other communities to adapt these experiences to their own environments so that CRC screening rates can be maximized.

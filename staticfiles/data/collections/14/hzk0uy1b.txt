AIM To evaluate efficacy, safety and quality of life of the patients with renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) treated with percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine patients (7 females and 2 males; mean age 27.6 years, range 23-34), with 10 renal AMLs with a mean size of 6.3 cm (range 4.5-8.5) were treated with image-guided percutaneous MWA. Indications for treatment were the risk of rupture/hemorrhage due to size greater than 4 cm and symptomatology; in one case, a previous hemorrhage was the indication for treatment. During follow-up, the volume of the ablated AMLs and its relationship with the relief of symptoms were registered. Technical and clinical success, safety, and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated in a mean follow-up of 9 months (range 3-12). RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Clinical success was obtained in all cases; the volume of the ablated AMLs was not related with symptoms relief; all patients referred a significant improvement in their QOL, with a regularization of daily activities. There were no major procedural complications or delayed adverse events. A small self-limited post-procedural subcapsular hematoma was registered. Post-ablation syndrome was registered in 5 cases and was self-limited in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Symptoms relief, lower risk of hemorrhage and a normalized QOL were obtained in all patients with a safe and mini-invasive procedure.

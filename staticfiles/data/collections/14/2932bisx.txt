Abstract The specific identification of 100 adenoviruses detected in faeces by electron microscopy was attempted using a combination of group-specific and sub-genus F (type 40 41 ) specific enzyme assays, and isolation in cell culture followed by specific neutralization. Sixty-three were considered to be AdF strains i.e. types 40 or 41 and 37, of which 33 were isolated in cell culture, were deemed to be non-AdF serotypes. The relevance of these results in relation to the diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis is discussed.

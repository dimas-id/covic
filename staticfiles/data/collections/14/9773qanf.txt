Knowledge graphs are a data format that enables the representation of semantics. Most of the available graphs focus on the representation of facts, their features, and relations between them. However, from the point of view of possible applications of semantically rich data formats in intelligent, real-world scenarios, there is a need for knowledge graphs that describe contextual information regarding realistic and casual relations between items in the real world. In this paper, we present a methodology of generating knowledge graphs addressing such a need. We call them World-perceiving Knowledge Graphs â€“ WpKG. The process of their construction is based on analyzing images. We apply deep learning image processing methods to extract scene graphs. We combine these graphs, and process the obtained graph to determine importance of relations between items detected on the images. The generated WpKG is used as a basis for constructing possibility graphs. We illustrate the process and show some snippets of the generated knowledge and possibility graphs.

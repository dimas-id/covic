The 2020 global outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) is a serious threat to international health, and thus, there is an urgent need for discovery of novel therapies or use of repurposed drugs that can make a significant impact on slowing the spread of the virus. Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are a family cytokines of the early innate immune response to viruses that are being tested against SARS-CoV-2. However, coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 can suppress host IFN-I antiviral responses. Retinoids are a family molecules related to vitamin A that possess robust immune-modulating properties, including the ability to increase and potentiate the actions of IFN-I. Therefore, adjuvants such as retinoids, capable of increasing IFN-I-mediated antiviral responses, should be tested in combinations of IFN-I and antiviral drugs in pre-clinical studies of SARS-CoV-2.

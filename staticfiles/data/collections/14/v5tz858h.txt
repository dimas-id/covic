BACKGROUND: Reports on neurologic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have attracted broad attention. We present an unusual case of COVID-19-associated encephalitis mimicking a glial tumor. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old woman presented with headache and seizures. T2 fluid-attenuated inverse recovery imaging showed hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an elevated choline peak. Imaging findings were suggestive of high-grade glioma. Antiepileptic medication failed to achieve seizure control. A left anterior temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient had no postoperative deficits, and her symptoms completely improved. Histologic examination revealed encephalitis. Postoperatively, our patient tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our case raises awareness of neurologic manifestations of the disease and their potential to mimic glial tumors. For prompt diagnosis and prevention of transmission, clinicians should consider COVID-19 in patients with similar presentation.

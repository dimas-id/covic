The inhibition of human angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) has been regarded as a promising approach for the treatment of hypertension. Despite research attempts over many years, our understanding the mechanisms of activation and inhibition of ACE is still far from complete. Here, we present results of all atom molecular dynamics simulations of ACE with and without ligands. Two types of inhibitors, competitive and mixed non-competitive, were used to model the ligand bound forms. In the absence of a ligand the simulation showed spontaneous large hinge-bending motions of multiple conversions between the closed and open states of ACE, while the ligand bound forms were stable in the closed state. Our simulation results imply that the equilibrium between pre-existing backbone conformations shifts in the presence of a ligand. The hinge-bending motion of ACE is considered as an essential to the enzyme function. A mechanistic model of activation and the inhibition may provide valuable information for novel inhibitors of ACE.

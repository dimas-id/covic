PURPOSE To describe the use of Embozene microspheres as an alternative treatment for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF). CASE REPORT The DAVF was located close to the vertex and mainly fed by the left medial meningeal artery (MMA). Embolization was performed using Embozene microspheres due to stenosis in the posterior branch of the left MMA and a conglomerate of tortuous courses in the anterior branch. Complete occlusion was achieved without complication. Neurological symptoms improved, and the patient remained asymptomatic during 1-year follow-up. Angiography at 1 year did not reveal any revascularization. CONCLUSION Use of microspheres may be a safe and effective alternative treatment, particularly in patients with impeded access to the DAVF.

BACKGROUND A large number of studies have examined the potential complications of calf deep vein thrombosis (DVT). There is no consensus on when or how to treat patients to prevent these complications. This systematic review assessed the rate of proximal propagation, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding and recurrence in patients with isolated calf DVT. METHODS Database searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science were undertaken along with extensive cross-referencing. Two independent reviewers screened the papers using stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies were graded on six methodological standards. Data on propagation, pulmonary embolism, recurrence and major bleeding were abstracted. RESULTS A total of 4261 papers were found; 15 met the inclusion criteria, including five randomized clinical trials and ten prospective cohort studies. The propagation rate to the popliteal vein or above was around 9 per cent and the rate of pulmonary embolism was close to 1Â·5 per cent. No studies found anticoagulant therapy to reduce the rate of adverse outcomes. CONCLUSION The literature on calf DVT is heterogeneous, limiting conclusions from data analysis. Adverse outcomes are infrequent and studies do not suggest that they are reduced by anticoagulation.

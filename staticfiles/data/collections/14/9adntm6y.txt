In the United Kingdom, old infrastructure facilities along train tracks like overpasses should be repaired as soon as possible. In order to design them more optimally, we need to know the flow field around such facilities. In this study, a traveling train and a stationary overpass were reproduced in a computational domain, and the flow field around the train and the overpass was simulated with the MCD method and the Expanded Sliding Mesh approach. In the conventional Sliding Mesh approach, sliding planes must be completely adjacent to other Sliding planes, that is, Sliding planes cannot be adjacent to both other Sliding planes and outer boundaries simultaneously. Then, the Expanded Sliding Mesh approach was proposed. The results given by using the MCD method and the Expanded Sliding Mesh approach were compared with the experimental results given by Baker, and their good qualitative and quantitative agreements were shown in almost cases. Only in the case that the overpass is very close to the train, the effects of boundary layers on laminar flow and turbulence need to be considered for more precise computation.

This chapter starts by providing a historical background of our research endeavors over the past half-century to develop various isotope-aided methods in biological NMR spectroscopy, since innovations bloom only on the rich ground cultivated by previous investigators. We then focused on the stereo-array isotope-labeling (SAIL) method, one of our recent accomplishments, which culminates the isotope-aided NMR technologies for structural studies of proteins from various aspects: accurate structural determinations of large proteins, elaboration for automated structural determination, highly efficient and versatile residue-selective methyl labeling with newly developed auxotrophic E. coli strains, large-amplitude slow-breathing motion (LASBM) as revealed by the aromatic ring flipping of the residues in ligand-binding interfaces, and applications of the deuterium-induced (13)C-NMR isotope shift to investigate the hydrogen exchange phenomena of side-chain polar groups. Meanwhile, the expected role of NMR spectroscopy has been rapidly shifting from structure determinations to dynamics studies of biologically interesting targets, such as membrane proteins and larger protein complexes. The dynamic aspects of protein–protein and protein–ligand interactions are closely related to their biological functions and can be efficiently studied by using proteins residue selectively labeled with amino acids bearing optimized labeling patterns, prepared by cellular expression. We are absolutely confident that biological NMR spectroscopy will continually develop with further innovations of isotope-labeling technologies in the coming era, featuring ultrahigh field spectrometers beyond 1 GHz.

COVID-19 (also known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus) first emerged in Wuhan, China and spread across the globe with unprecedented effect and has now become the greatest crisis of the modern era. The COVID-19 has proved much more pervasive demands for diagnosis that has driven researchers to develop more intelligent, highly responsive and efficient detection methods. In this work, we focus on proposing AI tools that can be used by radiologists or healthcare professionals to diagnose COVID-19 cases in a quick and accurate manner. However, the lack of a publicly available dataset of X-ray and CT images makes the design of such AI tools a challenging task. To this end, this study aims to build a comprehensive dataset of X-rays and CT scan images from multiple sources as well as provides a simple but an effective COVID-19 detection technique using deep learning and transfer learning algorithms. In this vein, a simple convolution neural network (CNN) and modified pre-trained AlexNet model are applied on the prepared X-rays and CT scan images dataset. The result of the experiments shows that the utilized models can provide accuracy up to 98 % via pre-trained network and 94.1 % accuracy by using the modified CNN.

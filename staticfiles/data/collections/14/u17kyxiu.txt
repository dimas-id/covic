BACKGROUND: Despite the high burden of respiratory infection and the importance of early and accurate diagnosis, there is no simple diagnostic test to rule in viral infection as a cause of respiratory symptoms. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on human nasal epithelial cells following stimulation of the intracellular viral recognition receptor RIG-I. Next, we evaluated whether measuring identified host mRNAs and proteins from patient nasopharyngeal swabs could predict the presence of a respiratory virus in the sample. RESULTS: Our first study showed that a signature of 3 mRNAs, CXCL10, IFIT2, and OASL, predicted respiratory virus detection with an accuracy of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9–1.0), and identified proteins correlating with virus detection. In a second study, elevated CXCL11 or CXCL10 protein levels identified samples containing respiratory viruses, including viruses not on the initial test panel. Overall area under the curve (AUC) values were: CXCL11 AUC = 0.901 (95% CI, 0.86–0.94); CXCL10 AUC = 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80–0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Host antiviral mRNAs and single host proteins detectable using nasopharyngeal swabs accurately predict the presence of viral infection. This approach holds promise for developing rapid, cost-effective tests to improve management of patients with respiratory illnesses.

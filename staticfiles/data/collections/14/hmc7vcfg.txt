The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the world since first being identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. In order to prepare for the surge of patients and the corresponding increase in radiology exams, clear and detailed policies need to be implemented by hospitals and radiology departments. In this article, we highlight the experiences and policies at LAC+USC Medical Center, the largest single provider of healthcare in LA County. Our policies aim to reduce the risk of transmission, guide patient management and workflow, preserve and effectively allocate resources, and be responsive to changing dynamics. We hope this communication may help other institutions in dealing with this pandemic as well as future outbreaks.

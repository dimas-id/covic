Nurses have historically led efforts to improve the health of populations while simultaneously and unselfishly providing care during pivotal moments of national need. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on the US health care system, including severe shortages of hospital beds, supplies, equipment, pharmaceuticals, and healthy frontline clinicians. Perioperative and perianesthesia leaders and clinicians have unique opportunities to provide patient care during the COVID-19 crisis. In this manuscript, we describe the initial changing roles and contributions of perioperative and perianesthesia registered nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and share recent experiences from a military medical center. Perioperative and perianesthesia nurses are vital to the overall nursing viability of the health care system, as they possess the requisite knowledge and skills to provide expert clinical care in many hospital settings and meet the demands of a global pandemic.

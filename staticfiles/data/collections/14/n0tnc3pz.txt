BACKGROUND Anastomotic leakages are severe complications of upper gastrointestinal surgery with serious morbidity and mortality. Until recently, only abscess drainage was possible. Since 2007, removable and repositionable covered metal self-expandable stents (RReCoMSeS) have been used in our hospital to cover leaks. METHODS Patients with postsurgical gastrointestinal leaks treated with RReCoMSeS between January 2007 and March 2010 were retrospectively evaluated and described. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were treated with RReCoMSeS (totally covered Choo/Hanaro and partially covered Endoflex stents). Included patients had anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy (15) and bariatric surgery (11). Overall successful sealing of the leak occurred in 81 % (including multiple procedures). In total 33 RReCoMSeS were used (mean 1.3 stents and 1.7 procedures per patient). Twenty-one of 33 RReCoMSeS succeeded in sealing the leak (64 %). Migration occurred in 24 % RReCoMSeS, and 9 % disintegrated. One stent (3 %) caused a perforation. CONCLUSIONS RReCoMSeS are a safe alternative for treating postsurgical leaks in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In 81 % of patients and with 64 % of the inserted stents, leaks were sealed successfully, with few complications. Fewer stents per patient were needed thanks to their repositionability. Stent migration is a major problem.

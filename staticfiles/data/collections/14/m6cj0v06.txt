Background The management of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. It is unclear whether these subjects should be tested in the absence of symptoms and if those can guide diagnosis. Methods Occupational and clinical characteristics of all the consecutive HCWs who performed a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a University Hospital from February 24, 2020, to March 31, 2020, were collected. Frequencies of positive tests were compared according to selected variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then applied. Findings Positive tests were 138 among 1,573 HCWs (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.4-10.3), with a marked difference between symptomatic (20.2%, 95%CI: 16.7-24.1) and asymptomatic (3.7%, 95%CI: 2.7-5.1) subjects (p<0.001). Physicians were the group with the highest frequency of positive tests (10.6%, 95%CI: 8.3-13.4) whereas clerical workers and technicians displayed the lowest frequency (2.9%, 95%CI: 0.8-7.3). The likelihood of being positive increased with the number of reported symptoms and the strongest predictors of a positive test were taste and smell alterations (odds ratio [OR]= 29.7) and fever (OR = 7.21). The median time from first positive test to a negative test was 23 days (95%CI: 19-24). Interpretation In this Italian group of HCWs exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 the presence of symptoms, especially taste and smell alterations and fever, was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median time to clear the virus from nasopharynx was 23 days.

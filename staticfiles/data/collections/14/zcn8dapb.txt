PURPOSE Pelvic venous insuffiency (PVI) can be responsible for pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) and also lower limb varicose veins. MATERIAL AND METHODS Charts of all women who had pelvic venography for PVI from September 2013 to August 2014 were reviewed. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia through left femoral approach. In case of reflux without associated obstructive lesions, embolization with coils and polidocanol foam was performed during the same procedure. RESULTS 119 women, with median age 39 years were explored (86 with PCS and 102 with lower limb venous disease). Of these, 78 had an isolated reflux and were embolized and 41 had an obstructive disease (29 iliocaval obstructive lesions (ICOL), 4 nutcracker syndrome (NCS), and 8 with an association of both). Median follow-up was 4 months. Of the 12 NCS, 5 had surgical treatment and 7 had stenting of the left iliac vein without embolization. All patients with ICOL without NCS were treated by stenting in 28 and by a Palma procedure in 1 (failure to recanalize). Primary and secondary patency rates were 97% at 12 months. Embolization led to improvement of PCS in 91% (60% without any pain) and of lower limb varicose veins in 51% by itself. If 82% need an additional treatment of lower limb varicose veins, embolization allowed a switch of strategy from surgery to sclerosis. CONCLUSION PVI can cause lower limb symptoms. In most cases, it is due to reflux and can be treated under local anesthesia by embolization. This technique is safe and efficient. Obstructive lesions must be recognized and treated.

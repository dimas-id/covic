PURPOSE Seroma is among the most common complications of laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) for especially large indirect inguinal hernia, and may be regarded as a recurrence by some patients. A potential area localized behind the mesh and extending from the inguinal cord into the scrotum may be one of the major etiological factors of this complication. Our aim is to describe a novel technique in preventing pseudorecurrence by using fibrin sealant to close that potential dead space. METHODS Forty male patients who underwent laparoscopic TEP for indirect inguinal hernia with at least 100-mL volume were included in this prospective clinical study. While fibrin sealant was used to close the potential dead space in the study group, nothing was used in the control group. The volume of postoperative fluid collection on ultrasound was compared between the groups. RESULTS Patient characteristics and the volumes of hernia sac were similar between the 2 groups. The mean volume of postoperative fluid collection was found as 120.2 mL in the control group and 53.7 mL in the study group, indicating a statistical significance (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Minimizing the potential dead space with a fibrin sealant can reduce the amount of postoperative fluid collection, namely the incidence of pseudorecurrence.

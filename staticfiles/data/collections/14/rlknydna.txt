This study investigated the effectiveness of a lighted stylet during tracheal intubation with direct laryngoscopy. The study randomly assigned 284 patients undergoing general anesthesia to either the simple stylet (Group S) or lighted stylet (Group L) groups. In both groups, stylet-assisted intubation was performed with direct laryngoscopy. In group S, a simple stylet was used and removed when the tip of the endotracheal tube was thought to have passed the larynx. In Group L, a lighted stylet was used and removed after confirming transillumination of the suprasternal notch. The success rate at the first attempt, total intubation time, incidence of mucosal bleeding, and severity of postoperative sore throat were compared. Compared to a simple stylet, the lighted stylet significantly increased the success rate of tracheal intubation at the first attempt (128 (90%) vs. 140 (99%), p = 0.003, Groups S and L, respectively). The incidence of mucosal bleeding was significantly higher in Group S (35 (25%) vs. 19 (13%), p = 0.011, Groups S and L, respectively). The total intubation time and degree of postoperative sore throat were not significantly different between the two groups. A lighted stylet increased the success rate of tracheal intubation during stylet-assisted tracheal intubation with direct laryngoscopy.

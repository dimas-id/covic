Ingestible electronic systems that are capable of embedded sensing, particularly within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and its accessory organs, have the potential to screen for diseases that are difficult, if not impossible to detect at an early stage using other means. Furthermore, these devices have the potential to (1) reduce labor and facility costs for a variety of procedures, (2) promote research for discovering new biomarker targets for associated pathologies, (3) promote the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous diagnostic aids for consumers, and (4) provide a foundation for topically targeted therapeutic interventions. These technological advances have the potential to make disease surveillance and treatment far more effective for a variety of conditions, allowing patients to lead longer and more productive lives. This review will examine the conventional techniques as well as ingestible sensors and sensing systems that are currently under development for use in disease screening and diagnosis for GI disorders. Design considerations, fabrication, and applications will be discussed.

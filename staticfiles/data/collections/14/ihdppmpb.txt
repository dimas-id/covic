We aim to evaluate the change in the diagnostic spectrum in dermatology outpatient applications compared to before COVID-19. All patients were enrolled from the Department of Dermatology between February 12 and May 8, 2020, the duration of 4 weeks before COVID-19 and eight weeks after were analyzed in 3 parts consisting of 4 weeks. Data obtained from the database such as age, gender, diagnoses were anonymized. Repeated applications with the same diagnosis in ten days after the first presentation were ignored. Compared to the pre-outbreak, there was a 3.5-fold decrease in dermatology applications in the first month after COVID-19 and an 8.8-fold in the second month. We found a significant increase in the frequency of diagnoses such as generalized pruritus, pityriasis rosea, alopecia areata, bacterial skin/mucosa diseases, and zona zoster after COVID-19. The frequency declined in diseases such as verruca vulgaris, hyperpigmentation, skin tag, melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis/solar lentigo. It has been found that the frequencies of most diseases, including acne (â25% of patients), did not change. We think that many factors, such as affecting the quality of life, risk perception, increased stress burden may cause a change in the diagnostic distribution of the dermatology applications.

A new pathogenic virus, COVID-19, appeared in 2019, in Wuhan, China, typically causing fever, cough, diarrhea and fatigue and significant mortality (Mao, 2020). From mid-January to mid-February in 2020, 214 patients with both non-severe and severe COVID-19 infections confirmed by nucleic acid tests, were examined by a panel of neurologists. Seventy-eight patients (36.4%) displayed neurological symptoms, including central nervous system symptoms of dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease with either ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage, ataxia, seizures; peripheral nervous system symptoms of taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain; and skeletal muscle injury (Mao, 2020).

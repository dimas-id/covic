When reasoning about container data structures that can hold duplicate elements, multisets are the obvious choice for representing the data structure abstractly. However, the decidability and complexity of constraints on multisets has been much less studied and understood than for constraints on sets. In this presentation, we outline an efficient decision procedure for reasoning about multisets with cardinality constraints. We describe how to translate, in linear time, multisets constraints to constraints in an extension of quantifier-free linear integer arithmetic, which we call LIA*. LIA* extends linear integer arithmetic with unbounded sums over values satisfying a given linear arithmetic formula. We show how to reduce a LIA* formula to an equisatisfiable linear integer arithmetic formula. However, this approach requires an explicit computation of semilinear sets and in practice it scales poorly even on simple benchmarks. We then describe a recent more efficient approach for checking satisfiability of LIA*. The approach is based on the use of under- and over-approximations of LIA* formulas. This way we avoid the space overhead and explicitly computing semilinear sets. Finally, we report on our prototype tool which can efficiently reason about sets and multisets formulas with cardinality constraints.

There is a global concern of increasing number of children presenting with inflammatory syndrome with clinical features simulating Kawasaki disease, during ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The authors report a very similar case of 5-y-old boy from a COVID-19 hotspot area who presented in late April 2020 with acute febrile illness with abdominal pain and loose stools followed by shock. On examination, child had bulbar conjunctivitis and extremity edema. Initial investigations showed high inflammatory parameters, elevated serum creatinine and liver enzymes. Echocardiography showed moderate LV dysfunction and normal coronaries. Cardiac enzymes were also elevated, suggesting myocarditis. He was treated with inotropic support, respiratory support with high flow nasal cannula, IV immunoglobulins, aspirin, steroids and diuretics. RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative twice. His clinical condition improved rapidly, was afebrile from day 2, inflammatory parameters decreased, left ventricular function improved and was discharged after 6 d of hospital stay.

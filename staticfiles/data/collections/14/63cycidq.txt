Prompt diagnosis and treatment of dermatologic emergencies in cancer patients decrease both morbidity and mortality. However the overlapping clinical presentations, complex medical and surgical comorbidities, and numerous medications often complicate diagnosis. Some dermatologic emergencies are primarily reactive and require immunosuppression such as pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) while others are a sign of systemic infection and require antimicrobials, such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Many primary inflammatory disorders, such as Stevenâ€“Johnson syndrome (SJS), can develop secondary infections and further complicate diagnosis and management. This chapter reviews the most common dermatologic emergencies seen in cancer patients, diagnostic dilemmas, and treatment options. Typical cases with photographs are also presented.

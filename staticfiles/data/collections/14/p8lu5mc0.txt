BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 period, there was a huge gap in the understanding of masks between east and west. At the same time, the mechanism of the mask and the effect after use, also appeared differences. The Objective of this Meta-analysis is to systematically evaluate the efficacy of masks for influenza in the community. METHODS: The Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Clinical Trials will be electronically searched to collect randomized controlled trials regarding the efficacy of masks for influenza in the community through Apr 2020. Two researchers independently screened and evaluated the obtained studies and extracted the outcome indexes. Revman 5.3 software will be used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The outbreak is continuing, and we need to be prepared for a long fight. If masks are effective, we need to promote their use as soon as possible. If masks are ineffective, strong evidence should be given. This is an urgent task and our team will finish it as soon as possible. CONCLUSION: Provide stronger evidence to solve the problem, should we wear masks or not right now.

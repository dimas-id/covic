We study multi-patch SIR and SEIR models where individuals may migrate from one patch to another in either of the susceptible, exposed/latent, infectious and recovered states. We assume that infections occur locally with a rate that depends on the patch as well as the state of the various groups of individuals in the patch, and the infectious periods have a general distribution, and do not change as individuals migrate from one patch to another. The migration processes in either of the three states are assumed to be Markovian, and independent of the infectious periods. The rates of migration from one patch to another may be different due to the population density and the manner of migration (for example, transportation). We establish a functional law of large number (FLLN) and a function central limit theorem (FCLT) for the susceptible, exposed/latent, infectious and recovered processes. In the FLLN, the limit is determined by a set of Volterra integral equations. In the special case of deterministic infectious periods, the limit becomes an ODE with delay. In the FCLT, the limit is given by a set of stochastic Volterra integral equations driven by a sum of Brownian motion and a continuous Gaussian processes of a particular covariance structure.

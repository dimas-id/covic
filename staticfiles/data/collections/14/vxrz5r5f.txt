This unprecedented virus has caused global pandemic and over 2,300,000 cases worldwide in total number(2), which has been bringing tremendous pressure and challenges to medical institutions and clinical staff around the world. 2019‐nCoV can be transmitted by droplets primarily, while it has been reported that surface contact transmission exists as well(3). Keeping the integrity of skin barrier is a critical method to prevent the spread of 2019‐nCoV, since skin is the first line of defense of human body(4). It is of prime importance to ensure and maintain the skin clean, sterilized and protected of clinical health care staff during the fight against the epidemic. Self‐protection of the medical staff is essential, however, utilizing protective equipment such as goggles, masks and protective clothing continuously impairs skin integrity and the skin damage caused by the respective protective measures must be taken seriously.

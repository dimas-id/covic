PURPOSE OF REVIEW We aim to review the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections and the strengths and limitations of multiplex respiratory pathogen panels that are currently available along with their respective features and differences. RECENT FINDINGS We give particular emphasis to the pathogens included on each test and evaluate their performance in the hospital setting. SUMMARY We conclude with a discussion on the evidence for the clinical utility of respiratory pathogen multiplex panels in hospitalized patients, including the potential for coinfection with viral and bacterial pathogens.

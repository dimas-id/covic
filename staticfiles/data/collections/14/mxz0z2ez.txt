Globally, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is threatening human health and changing the way people live. With the increasing evidence showing comorbidities of COVID-19 and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the Pacific region, where approximately 75% of deaths are due to NCDs, is significantly vulnerable during this crisis unless urgent action is taken. Whilst enforcing the critical mitigation measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific, it is also paramount to incorporate and strengthen NCD prevention and control measures to safeguard people with NCDs and the general population; keep people healthy and minimise the impact of COVID-19. To sustain wellbeing of health, social relationships, and the economy in the Pacific, it is a critical time for all governments, development partners and civil societies to show regional solidarity in the fight against emerging COVID-19 health crisis and existing Pacific NCDs crisis through a whole of government and whole of society approach.

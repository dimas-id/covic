Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) ORF5 and ORF7 sequences from Belarus were found to be of the European (EU) genotype, but grouped separately from all other EU genotype sequences described so far, including live-attenuated EU genotype PRRSV vaccines and Italian EU genotype sequences, some of which have been associated with reduced vaccine efficacy. Also, the Belarusian EU-PRRSV exhibited extreme ORF7 size polymorphism, ranging from 375 nt (the smallest EU genotype ORF7 yet described) to 393 nt (the largest ORF7 yet described for any arterivirus). With the Belarusian sequences, the diversity of EU genotype PRRSV now exceeds that of the North American (US) genotype PRRSV, suggesting a European origin of PRRSV. Finally, a very sharp geographical demarcation of highly diverse EU genotype PRRSV was observed along the eastern Polish border. The new Belarusian sequences have relevance for vaccine and diagnostic-antigen design and show that sequence analysis of PRRSV from more eastern parts of Europe may offer further insights into the emergence and evolution of PRRSV.

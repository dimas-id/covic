OBJECTIVE Knowledge of mechanisms directing diarthrodial joint development may be useful in understanding joint pathologies and identifying new therapies. We have previously established that axolotl salamanders can fully repair large articular cartilage lesions, which may be due to the presence of an interzone-like tissue in the intra-articular space. Study objectives were to further characterize axolotl diarthrodial joint structure and determine the differentiation potential of interzone-like tissue in a skeletal microenvironment. DESIGN Diarthrodial joint morphology and expression of aggrecan, brother of CDO (BOC), type I collagen, type II collagen, and growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) were examined in femorotibial joints of sexually mature (>12 months) axolotls. Joint tissue cellularity was evaluated in individuals from 2 to 24 months of age. Chondrogenic potential of the interzone was evaluated by placing interzone-like tissue into 4 mm tibial defects. RESULTS Cavitation reached completion in the femoroacetabular and humeroradial joints, but an interzone-like tissue was retained in the intra-articular space of distal limb joints. Joint tissue cellularity decreased to 7 months of age and then remained stable. Gene expression patterns of joint markers are broadly similar in developing mammals and mature axolotls. When interzone-like tissue was transplanted into critical size skeletal defects, an accessory joint developed within the defect site. CONCLUSIONS These experiments indicate that mature axolotl diarthrodial joints are phenotypically similar to developing synovial joints in mammals. Generation of an accessory joint by interzone-like tissue suggests multipotent cellular differentiation potential similar to that of interzone cells in the mammalian fetus. The data support the axolotl as a novel vertebrate model for joint development and repair.

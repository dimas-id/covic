Near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to measure regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) based on the total hemoglobin (t-Hb) signal strength. To date, few studies have investigated the changes of systemic oxygenation and t-Hb signal strength during hemodialysis (HD). This study aimed to (1) monitor rSO2 and t-Hb signal strength in the brain, liver, and lower-limb muscle during HD and (2) clarify the differences in rSO2 and t-Hb signal strength in each compartment. Fifty-three patients receiving 4-h HD were included and divided into three groups according to the compartments in which tissue oxygenation was measured as follows: brain (n = 44), liver (n = 42), and lower-limb muscle (n = 40). The rSO2 and t-Hb signal strength was monitored using an INVOS 5100c (Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The rSO2 levels were significantly lower in the brain than in the liver from HD initiation to the end (HD initiation: rSO2 in the brain and liver, 46.5 ± 1.3 and 52.4 ± 1.7%, respectively, p = 0.031). Furthermore, compared to the t-Hb signal strength ratio [value at t (min) during HD/initial value before HD] in the brain during HD, there were significant increases in the liver and lower-limb muscle, respectively. In conclusion, deterioration of cerebral oxygenation was remarkable compared to the hepatic oxygenation in HD patients. Our results, which revealed significant differences among the t-Hb signal strength ratios in the brain, liver, and lower-limb muscle during HD, might reflect the non-uniform body-fluid reduction within systemic tissues induced by ultrafiltration.

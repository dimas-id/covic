Malaysia has one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 infections within the Southeast Asian nations, which led to enforcements of drastic measures of Malaysian Movement Control Order‚Äù to curb disease transmission. The overwhelming increasing amount of infections has led to a major strain on healthcare services. This causes shortages in hospital beds, ventilators and various critical personnel protective equipment. This article focuses on the critical adaptations from a general surgery department in Malaysia which is part of a Malaysia tertiary centre that treats COVID-19 patients. The core highlights of these strategies during this pandemic are: (1) surgery ward and clinic decongestions; (2) deferment of elective surgeries; (3) restructuring of medical personnel; (4) utilization of online applications for tele-communication; (5) operating room adjustments and patient screening; and (6) continuing learning and updating practices in context to COVID-19. These adaptations are important for the continuation of emergency surgery services, preventing transmission of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers and optimization of medical personnel work force in times of a global pandemic. In addition, an early analysis on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in Malaysia towards the reduction in total number of elective/emergent/trauma surgeries performed is described in this article.

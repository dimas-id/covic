UNLABELLED We report a case of 31 years-old female suffering from complicated giant bulla in the right upper pulmonary lobe. The patient was admitted to our hospital with a radiologic diagnosis of hydro - pneumothorax treated by chest tube in a first time, and later, for prolonged air leaks, by uniportal VATS with a single 4-cm skin incision. We have observed a giant ruptured bulla in right upper lobe, so we have performed bullectomy and mechanical pleurodesis. This case, in our knowledge, represents the first giant bulla resection performed by uniportal VATS. KEY WORDS Giant bulla, Giant bullous emphysema, Uniportal VATS.

Background: Older adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) face an increased risk of adverse health outcomes including mortality. Ethical guidelines consider allocation of limited resources based on likelihood of survival, frailty, co-morbidities and age. However, the association of frailty with clinical outcomes in older COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Objectives: To determine the association between frailty and short-term mortality in older adults hospitalized for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective single-center observational study. Setting and participants: N = 81 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of Imelda general hospital, Belgium. Measurements: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical and radiological variables, co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results: Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65 - 97 years), median CFS score of 7 (range 2 - 9), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within six weeks, eighteen patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = 0.03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = 0.011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r = 0.301, P = 0.009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = 0.02) and RT-PCR Ct value (r = -0.285, P = 0.015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH and RT-PCR Ct values (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH and viral load significantly predicted survival. Conclusions and implications: Although their prognosis is worse, even the oldest and most severely frail patients may benefit from hospitalization for COVID-19, if sufficient resources are available.

The clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system has significant therapeutic potentials for lung congenital diseases such as cystic fibrosis, as well as other pulmonary disorders like lung cancer and obstructive diseases. Local administration of CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics through inhalation can achieve high drug concentration and minimise systemic exposure. While the field is advancing with better understanding on the biological functions achieved by CRISPR/Cas9 systems, the lack of progress in inhalation formulation and delivery of the molecule may impede their clinical translation efficiently. This forward-looking review discussed the current status of formulations and delivery for inhalation of relevant biologics such as genes (plasmids and mRNAs) and proteins, emphasising on their design strategies and preparation methods. By adapting and optimising formulation strategies used for genes and proteins, we envisage that development of inhalable CRISPR/Cas9 liquid or powder formulations for inhalation administration can potentially be fast-tracked in near future.

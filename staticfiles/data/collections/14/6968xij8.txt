PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This report updates research on parents with IDD and their children published since 2014. RECENT FINDINGS: Since 2014, a plethora of studies using large administrative databases in different countries support a contextual approach to understand why parents with IDD and their children may have worse outcomes than other families. In most studies, increased risk of ill health in women with IDD and health and developmental problems in their children were fully or partially accounted for by socioeconomic and psychosocial hardships. New research has found that pregnant women with IDD tend to have risk factors for pregnancy, birth, and postpartum complications that may contribute to adverse child outcomes. Intervention research is gradually becoming more contextualized. SUMMARY: More studies are needed on multicultural aspects of parenting, programs that could help parents with IDD overcome social and health disadvantages, comprehensive and coordinated service models that start during pregnancy, innovative parent support arrangements, parenting education for teens and young adults with IDD, use of technology, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based programs.

BACKGROUND Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), although in its embryonic phase, is currently experiencing important developments. The technique has been successfully applied for cholecystectomies and appendectomies. However, several doubts exist as to the technical limitations and feasibility of NOTES in other clinical settings. METHODS The authors have performed totally transvaginal colon resections in a sheep model. Although completion of the surgery was possible through the transvaginal route, the addition of a transumbilical laparoscope was used as an added safety measure. RESULTS Totally transvaginal resection of the sigmoid colon was performed for two sheep with no intra- or postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Totally transvaginal resection of the colon (pure NOTES) is feasible in a sheep model.

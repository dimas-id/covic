Mexico, like the rest of the world, is currently facing the The COVID-19 pandemic. Given the size of its territory, the efforts to contain the disease have involved both national and regional measures. For this work, the curves of daily new cases of each municipality reported by the federal government were compared. We found that 114 municipalities form a large network of statistically dependent epidemic phenomena. Based on the network's modular structure, these 114 municipalities can be split into four distinct communities of coordinated epidemic phenomena. These clusters are not limited by geographical proximity. These findings can be helpful for public health officials for the evaluation of past strategies and the development of new directed interventions.

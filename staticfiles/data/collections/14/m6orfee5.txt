BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is considered the most serious global health threat in recent times. As there is a current lack of approved treatments and vaccines, universal safety precautions (USPs) must be taken to deal with this emergency. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public with regard to USPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted during March 2020. A 20-item self-administered questionnaire was developed, validated and distributed using Google Forms through social media networks. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors influencing knowledge regarding COVID-19 USPs. RESULTS: Of the 1117 individuals who participated in the survey, the mean age was 28.8 ± 10.9 years, 32.9% had a post-graduate education, 45% had a professional job, and 40% belonged to the upper-middle economic class. Overall, the mean correct response scores were 63% for USP knowledge and 83% for USP beliefs. All the sociodemographic variables were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with the USP knowledge levels. Importantly, students were less likely to have a lower level of USP knowledge compared with the other occupations (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.23–0.53; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 rapidly change. These findings could guide public health authorities to make and implement precautionary measures to combat this pandemic.

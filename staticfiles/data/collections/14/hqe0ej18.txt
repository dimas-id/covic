The majority of children with febrile seizures have viral infections and viruses were detected in 22% to 63% of children in published studies. Using molecular methods, viruses were also detected in asymptomatic persons. A prospective study was conducted to detect respiratory and enteric viruses in 192 children with febrile seizures and compare the detection rates to those found in 156 healthy age-matched controls. A respiratory or enteric virus was detected in 72.9% of children with febrile seizures and in 51.4% of healthy controls. The viruses most strongly associated with febrile seizures were influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, human coronavirus, and rotavirus. Compared to healthy controls, the age-adjusted odds ratios for nasopharynx virus positivity in febrile seizure patients were 79.4, 2.8, 7.2, and 4.9 for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human coronavirus, respectively, and 22.0 for rotavirus in stool. The detected virus did not influence clinical features of febrile seizure.

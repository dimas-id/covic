The many emerging infectious diseases associated with Chiropteran species can have major impacts on both ecosystem and public health. As such, the scope of this chapter is to provide an overview of those potential bat-related zoonoses and their clinical relevance to people. With increased disease surveillance and a trend toward more human contact with bat populations, it is likely that additional zoonotic diseases will continue to be identified. Bat infection dynamics are driven by a complex interplay of ecological, immunological, behavioral, and anthropogenic factors. Interdisciplinary work will be needed in the future to better understand the drivers of disease emergence in bat populations and ultimately mitigate the threats that face both people and bats themselves.

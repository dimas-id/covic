Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common and contagious virus that results in acute respiratory tract infections in infants. In many cases, the symptoms of RSV remain mild, however, a subset of individuals develop severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis. As such, RSV is the chief cause of infant hospitalization within the United States. Typically, the immune response to RSV is a type 1 response that involves both the innate and adaptive immune systems. However, type 2 cytokines may also be produced as a result of infection of RSV and there is increasing evidence that children who develop severe RSV-associated bronchiolitis are at a greater risk of developing asthma later in life. This review summarizes the contribution of a newly described cell type, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), and epithelial-derived alarmin proteins that activate ILC2, including IL-33, IL-25, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). ILC2 activation leads to the production of type 2 cytokines and the induction of a type 2 response during RSV infection. Intervening in this innate type 2 inflammatory pathway may have therapeutic implications for severe RSV-induced disease.

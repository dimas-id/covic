BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining wide acceptance as a single surgical treatment for obesity. The reported morbidity and mortality rates are low. We herein report the results of LSG performed in a high-volume center by an experienced team. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all bariatric surgery (BS) was performed between May 2006 and December 2014. Data inspected included operative time, length of hospital stay (LOS), comorbidity resolution, re-operation, percent excess weight loss (%EWL), and 30-day morbidity and mortality. RESULTS In the study period, 3003 patients underwent BS (1901 (63 %) female). Mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 43 years (range 14-73) and 42.8 kg/m(2) (range 35-73), respectively. %EWL at 1 year was 72 % (n = 937; 57 % follow-up rate). There was 1 perioperative mortality due to bleeding (0.03 %). Comorbidity improvement and resolution were 98 % for obstructive sleep apnea, 79 % for diabetes mellitus, 87 % for dyslipidemia, and 85 % for hypertension. Mean operative time and LOS were 50 min (range 32-94) and 2.2 days (range 1-38), respectively. Of the patients, 132 had complications (4.4 %), 25 leaks (0.83 %), 63 bleeding (2.1 %), 1 intra-abdominal abscesses (0.03 %), 3 sleeve strictures (0.1 %), 2 mesenteric vein thromboses (0.06 %), 10 trocar site hernias (0.3 %), and 78 symptomatic cholelithiasis (2.6 %). Re-operation was needed in 13 patients (0.43 %). CONCLUSION In a high-volume center with an experienced team, LSG can be performed with low morbidity and mortality.

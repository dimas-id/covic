This study proposes a simulation model of rubella. SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, bioterrorism, to name a few. On the other hand, agent-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent the behaviour of each person on the computer. It also reveals the spread of infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on smallpox and Ebola fever model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccination, the gender-specific workplace and so on. The infectious simulation of rubella, which has not yet vaccinated completely for men in Japan, is implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine to all the men is crucial factors to prevent the spread in women.

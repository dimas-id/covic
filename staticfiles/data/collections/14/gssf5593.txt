AIMS: The present observational study aims to describe the political actions in place to fight COVID-19 in the South and Central America region (SACA) while protecting individuals with diabetes. METHODS: A survey with 12 questions was shared with all IDF-SACA member organizations, in 18 countries. A descriptive analysis was performed and a multivariate cluster analysis technique pam (partitioning around medoids) was applied. RESULTS: Two groups of countries were identified. The first group reported more difficulties (limitations in accessing basic or health needs) and fears (concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic), mostly countries with stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus, whereas most of the second group consisted of countries with less restrictive measures, and reported fewer difficulties. Only 37% responded that a policy was put into place to protect individuals with diabetes delivering their medicines and supplies at home (16%) or receiving at once medicine and supplies enough for 2-3 months (21%). All respondents reported as one of the main fears "be infected and do not receive adequate treatment" and/or "getting infected if going to the hospital or medical appointments". CONCLUSIONS: Most of the SACA countries lack timely implemented measures to protect individuals with diabetes, which may lead to present and future severe impact on the individuals, health system and economy.

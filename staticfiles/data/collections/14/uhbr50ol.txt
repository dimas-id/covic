Dengue is a systemic viral infection that is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquitoes. No vaccines or specific therapeutics are currently available for dengue. Lycorine, which is a natural plant alkaloid, has been shown to possess antiviral activities against flaviviruses. In this study, a series of novel lycorine derivatives were synthesized and assayed for their inhibition of dengue virus (DENV) in cell cultures. Among the lycorine analogues, 1‐acetyllycorine exhibited the most potent anti‐DENV activity (EC(50)=0.4 μm) with a reduced cytotoxicity (CC(50)>300 μm), which resulted in a selectivity index (CC(50)/EC(50)) of more than 750. The ketones 1‐acetyl‐2‐oxolycorine (EC(50)=1.8 μm) and 2‐oxolycorine (EC(50)=0.5 μm) also exhibited excellent antiviral activities with low cytotoxicity. Structure–activity relationships for the lycorine derivatives against DENV are discussed. A three‐dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship model was established by using a comparative molecular‐field analysis protocol in order to rationalize the experimental results. Further modifications of the hydroxy group at the C1 position with retention of a ketone at the C2 position could potentially lead to inhibitors with improved overall properties.

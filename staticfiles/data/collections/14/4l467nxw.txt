Canada and the US have strong economic ties and form part of an integrated North American pork industry. Canada's pork industry is export‐oriented, and the US represents a key market for both live pigs and pork. Pork value chain stakeholders include input suppliers, pig producers, transportation companies, slaughter plants, wholesalers, and retailers. There are three overriding areas of concern for the Canadian pork industry with respect to potential impacts of the current pandemic (COVID‐19). The first is Canada/US trade and the ability to continue exporting Canadian live pigs and pork to the US. The second is labour and the impact of potential absenteeism on all sectors of the pork value chain. The third is global trade, because Canada's pork industry relies heavily on exporting pork to markets around the world. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

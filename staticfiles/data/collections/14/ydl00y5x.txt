BACKGROUND Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the major swine pathogens. This virus causes immune suppression and other secondary infections, leading to significant economic losses in the swine industry. Tea seed saponins (TS) are a natural extract from tea seeds with anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity. In this study, we demonstrated that TS possessed anti-PRRSV activity. METHODS MTT assay and trypan blue staining were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and antiviral ability of TS in cell culture. Apoptosis was measured to assess the safety of TS on Marc-145 cells. Time-of-addition assay, entry inhibition assay and virucidal assay were used to assess the antiviral action of TS. The effect of TS on host cellular gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR. Absolute quantification RT-PCR and western blot were used to study the inhibitory effect of TS on PRRSV N gene and protein expression. RESULTS Our results showed that 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) and 50% effective concentration (EC50) of TS were 59.86 ±0.3841 µg/ml and 24.29 ±1.194 μg/ml, respectively. The maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of TS on Marc-145 cells was 30 μg/ml. TS inhibited PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis and effectively inhibited PRRSV replication by reducing the expression of host cellular gene PABP, and significantly inhibited virus N gene/protein expression. CONCLUSIONS TS possessed anti-PRRSV activity in vitro and could serve as a potential antiviral drug for PRRSV prevention and control.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare but devastating manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients with or without other systemic autoimmune diseases. Data regarding diagnosis and treatment are limited to case series. We review diagnostic and therapeutic strategies employed in APS patients with DAH and discuss our experience in managing these complex patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary capillaritis likely contributes to the pathogenesis, however is only observed in half of the biopsies. Corticosteroids induce remission in the majority of patients, however almost half recur and require a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive to maintain remission. Cyclophosphamide- or rituximab-based regimens achieve the highest remission rates (50%); other strategies include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, and/or azathioprine. SUMMARY: Given the rarity of DAH in APS, treatment is guided by interdisciplinary experience. Why certain patients achieve full remission with corticosteroids while others require immunosuppressive agents is unknown; future research should focus on the pathophysiology and optimal management.

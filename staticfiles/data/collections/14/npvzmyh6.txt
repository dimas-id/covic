Different surgical techniques exist for the treatment of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD), of which minimally invasive techniques have become the standard. We reviewed our experience with management and treatment of ZD and sought to determine what type of treatment is most effective and efficient. We selected patients who underwent treatment for ZD between January 2004 and January 2014 at our tertiary referral center. All procedures were performed by ENT surgeons. The medical records were reviewed for pre- and intraoperative characteristics and follow-up. Of our 94 patients (58 male, 36 female), 75 underwent endoscopic cricopharyngeal myotomy (42 stapler, 33 laser) and 6 received treatment via transcervical approach. 13 interventions were aborted. Mean operating time was 49.0 min for stapler, 68.3 for laser and 124.0 for the transcervical approach. Its respective median post-operative admission durations were 2.0, 3.0 and 3.0 days. After the first treatment, of the 75 endoscopic procedures, 45 patients (23 stapler, 22 laser) had complete symptom resolution. In the transcervical group 4 (67 %) patients were symptom free and one patient died of complications. In the endoscopically treated patients, ten complications occurred, of which 8 G1 and 2 G2 (Clavien Dindo classification). In the transcervical group 2 complications occurred, 1 G3b and 1 G5. Both endoscopic techniques provide efficient management of Zenker's diverticulum with the stapler-assisted modality providing a shorter surgery duration and hospital admission. Although there is no significant difference in terms of complications or recurrence rates for both endoscopic techniques, it seems that stapler patients are at higher risk of having a re-intervention and of having more severe complications.

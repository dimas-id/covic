Endovascular treatment of wide-necked aneurysms with preservation of the parent artery remains a challenge. The authors describe a novel and simple technique to navigate a balloon or stent-delivery catheter across a wide-necked aneurysm in which previously existing methods could have failed to pass the catheter across the neck of the aneurysm, which we have named "temporary caging" technique. The technical results using this method are presented in 6 cases.

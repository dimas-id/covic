PURPOSE OF REVIEW Transmission of acute respiratory tract viral infections in healthcare environments is a major problem worldwide. We review recent literature of viruses imported to hospitals from the local community and from abroad, their modes of transmission and measures required to reduce and contain them. RECENT FINDINGS Common causes of outbreaks include influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and coronaviruses. Major lethal outbreaks of viral respiratory infections in hospitals have been caused by coronaviruses imported from abroad by travelers. SUMMARY Although viruses circulating in the local community are common causes of hospital outbreaks, major outbreaks have been caused by the coronaviruses imported from abroad by travelers. A high degree of clinical awareness and rapid enforcement of infection control measures are required to prevent transmission and spread.

The SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed unprecedented challenges on the health care system in the United States with New York City at its epicenter. By the end of the 8 week (4/23/2020) since the virus's emergence in New York City, there have been 142,432 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10,977 deaths attributed to complications from COVID-19-related illnesses. Secondary to policies enacted by the New York State government to limit spread of the virus, Orthopedic Surgery departments at hospitals around the area have witnessed an abrupt change in clinical demands. At a local level one trauma hospital in Queens, New York, Orthopedic Surgery elective cases have been cancelled, trauma consult volume has experienced a sharp decline, and both residents and attendings have been repurposed to meet the new clinical demands of this medical crisis. Our own orthopedic surgery service has adopted care for patients normally admitted to an internal medicine service in a novel Ortho-Medical COVID-19 management team. We prepared this primer to make our experience with caring for COVID-19 patents available as a reference for other surgical subspecialty services preparing to adjust the clinical focus of their hospital teams during this or future pandemics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Level V.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which originated in China has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This virus gets transmitted through air droplets and direct contact. Health care workers doing aerosol-generating procedures are at a higher risk of acquiring the infection. Many procedures done by the gastrointestinal endoscopists are classified as aerosol-generating procedures, which in turn underline the need for proper safety precautions during these procedures. Apart from general safety measures advised by various organizations, proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a pivotal factor in safeguarding health care personnel during endoscopy. This article provides a short overview of the different PPEs available and their proper use in endoscopy.

The National IHR Focal Point is a center set up by each Member State of the World Health Organization (WHO) in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005). The International Health Regulations (IHR) were adopted on 23 May 2005 at the World Health Assembly and entered into force since 15 June 2007 as the legal instrument designed to help protect all countries from uncontrolled international spread of diseases and other urgent public health threats. According to Article 2 of IHR the purpose and scope of these Regulations are to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. Primarily, the scope of IHR is to establish a system of early warning (in accordance with Article 6 and 7) with the functioning in each country National IHR Focal Point which is available at any time to communicate with WHO IHR Contact Points and other entities. The tasks of the National IHR Fo- cal Point in Poland which was appointed by the Minister of Health and runs in the Department of Epidemiology, National Institute of Public Health--National Institute of Hygiene from 1 September 2007 are the notification of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern occurring in Poland or abroad and the dissemination of this information to the WHO, other National IHR Focal Points or competent authorities responsible for public health.

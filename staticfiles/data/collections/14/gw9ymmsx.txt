Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is known to be associated with increased risk of infections, compared to bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. In viral diseases for which specific treatment is available, real-time PCR assays are reliable diagnostic tools for timely initiation of appropriate therapy and for rapid assessment of the efficacy of antiviral treatment strategies. A retrospective review of samples from a group of seven adult cord blood stem cell recipients was made. Serum samples taken up to 180 days after transplantation were examined with quantitative real-time PCR for measurement of viral load (CMV, HHV-6, and HHV-7). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was detected in samples taken from four patients (57%) in the period of 20–80 days after transplantation. Products of amplification of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA were found in samples taken between days 25 and 37 following UCBT from only one patient (14%). On the other hand, the majority of patients (n = 6, 86%) had HHV-7 DNA detected in the period 15–58 days after transplantation. Co-infection with HHV-7 was demonstrated at onset of all episodes of microbiologically confirmed CMV or HHV-6 infection. Our observations indicate that real-time PCR is not only useful for monitoring herpesviral infections in transplant recipients, but is also a powerful method for clarifying the relationships between the viral load and clinical symptoms. Further investigation with a much larger group of patients will be needed to confirm these observations and translate them into a clinical approach.

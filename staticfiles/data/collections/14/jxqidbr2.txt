Pulmonary toxoplasmosis is rare, particularly in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Here, we describe two severe cases in patients not known to be HIV-infected.

Pulmonary toxoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in potentially HIV-infected patients with respiratory symptoms.

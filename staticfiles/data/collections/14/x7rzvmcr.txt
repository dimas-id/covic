Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a significant global medical issue, with a growing number of cumulative confirmed cases. However, a large number of COVID-19 patients have overcome the disease, meeting hospital discharge criteria, and are gradually returning to work and social life. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may cause further downstream issues in these patients, such as due to possible reactivation of the virus, long-term pulmonary defects, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this study, we therefore queried relevant literature concerning SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 for reference to come to a consensus on follow-up strategies. We found that strategies such as implementation of PCR testing, imaging surveillance, and psychological assessments, starting at the time of discharge, were necessary for long-term follow-up. If close care is given to every aspect of coronavirus management, we expect that the pandemic outbreak will soon be overcome. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

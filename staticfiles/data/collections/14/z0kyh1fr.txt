Quantitative studies using validated questionnaires on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) of Nurses exposed to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China are rare and the baseline PTSD must first be evaluated before prevention. This study aimed to investigate the factors potentially involved in the level of PTSD of Nurses exposed to COVID-19 in China.In this cross-sectional study, male and female Nurses (nâ=â202) exposed to COVID-19 from HuBei China were included in the final sample. The PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C) questionnaire and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used for evaluation. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis and spearman correlation test were performed to assess the association between various factors associated with PTSD.The incidence of PTSD in Nurses exposed to COVID-19 was 16.83%, the PCL-C score was 27.00 (21.00-34.00), and the highest score in the three dimensions was avoidance dimension 9.50 (7.00-13.25); multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that job satisfaction and gender were independently associated with lower PCL-C scores (both Pâ<â.001); PCL-C scores were correlated with positive coping (râ=â-0.151, Pâ=â.032), negative coping (râ=â0.154, Pâ=â.029).Nurses exposed to COVID-19 from HuBei China with job satisfaction, male and positive coping had low PCL-C scores which necessitate reducing the PTSD level by ways of improving job satisfaction, positive response, and strengthening the psychological counseling of female nurses in order to reduce the risk of psychological impairment.

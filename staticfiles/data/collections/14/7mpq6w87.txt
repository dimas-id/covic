BACKGROUND Zenker diverticulum is a rare condition commonly associated with dysphagia and respiratory symptoms/complications, which are alarming especially in the elderly population. Aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms/complications and the effects of minimally invasive trans-oral surgery in these patients. METHODS Consecutive adult patients who underwent trans-oral septum stapling for Zenker diverticulum were included in a retrospective, observational cohort study. Pre- and postoperative symptoms, including chronic cough and aspiration pneumonia, were evaluated using a dedicated foregut questionnaire and were recorded on a prospectively maintained database. The operation was performed under general anesthesia. A barium swallow study and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed 6 months after the operation, and the foregut questionnaire was administered yearly. RESULTS A total of 139 patients were finally included in the study. The median age was 72 years. In 62 (44.6%, CI 36.2-53.3) patients, there was a history of chronic cough and/or aspiration pneumonia. Chronic cough was associated with pneumonia (p < 0.001), while pneumonia was associated with severe regurgitation (p < 0.042) and weight loss (p = 0.001). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 2.2% and there was no mortality. The median postoperative hospital stay was 2 days (range 0-22). The median follow-up was 38 months (range 2-105). At 3 years, a statistically significant reduction in the rate of chronic cough (36.8 vs. 7.9%, p < 0.001), recurrent episodes of pneumonia (6.6 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.031), dysphagia (78.9 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001), and regurgitation (67.1 vs. 6.6%, p < 0.001) was recorded. The probability of remaining symptom-free at 90 months of follow-up was 0.818 (CI: 0.745-0.899). CONCLUSIONS Trans-oral septum stapling is safe and can effectively reduce the burden of respiratory symptoms and complications associated with Zenker diverticulum.

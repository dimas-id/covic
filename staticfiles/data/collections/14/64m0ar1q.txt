New conjugates of 18β- and 18α-glycyrrhizic acids (GAs) each containing two di- or α-methyl esters of L-aspartic acid in the carbohydrate part of the glycosides were synthesized by the activated ester method using the N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. It was found that the conjugate of 18β-GA with Asp(OMe)(OMe) (4) at a concentration of 250 μg/mL inhibited effectively RT of HIV-1 and the accumulation of virus antigen p24 in MT-4 cell culture (95–97 %) and protected cells from the cytopathogenic action of the virus.

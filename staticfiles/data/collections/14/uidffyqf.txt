BACKGROUND Several devices are available for liver parenchyma transection (LPT). The aim of this study was to compare the Ultracision Harmonic scalpel (UHS) with the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) among patients who underwent hemi-right hepatectomies (RH) to homogenize transection areas. METHODS From September 2012 to June 2015, 24 patients who underwent the UHS surgery approach were matched with 24 patients who underwent the CUSA transection procedure for RH using propensity score matching. RESULTS Total operative time (TOT) was shorter in the UHS group, 240 minutes (range 172.5-298.8) versus 330 minutes (range 270-400) in the CUSA group ( P = .0002). The occurrence of hepatopathy (odds ratio = 17; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-230) and the use of the CUSA device (odds ratio = 8; 95% confidence interval = 0.98-77) were associated with a TOT exceeding 300 minutes in multivariate analysis ( P = .05). CONCLUSIONS The UHS is a safe and effective method of LPT as compared to the use of the CUSA system. TOT is statistically decreased.

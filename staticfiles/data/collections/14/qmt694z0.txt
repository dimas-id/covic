Nasopharyngeal sampling protocols for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis guidelines only recommend synthetic fiber swabs.

Cotton tipped plastic swabs are massively produced worldwide and would prevent swabs supplies shortage during current high SARS-CoV-2 testing demands, particularly on developing countries.

Abstract Norovirus (NoV) has been classified into 6 genogroups, GI-GVI. In the present study, we identified novel feline NoV (FNoV) M49-1 strain. The C-terminal of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the FNoV M49-1 strain was highly homologous with GIV FNoV and GIV lion norovirus, whereas VP1 was highly homologous with GVI canine NoV (CNoV). Based on the results of the Simplot analysis, the FNoV M49-1 strain may have been produced by recombination between GIV.2 FNoV and GVI.1 CNoV. In addition, specific pathogen-free cats inoculated with FNoV gene-positive-fecal samples developed diarrhea symptoms, and the viral gene was detected in their feces and blood.

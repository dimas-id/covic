This study investigated the anesthetic effect of the essential oils (EOs) from the peel of Citrus x aurantium (EOCA) and Citrus x latifolia (EOCL) on silver catfish Rhamdia quelen. Fish were exposed to different concentrations of EOCA and EOCL to determine time of anesthesia induction and recovery. Induction of anesthesia was observed in all fish exposed to 400, 600 or 800 µL L&#8722;1 EOCA and 300, 400 or 500 µL L&#8722;1 EOCL. Another group of fish were exposed for 8 h to 50, 100, or 200 µL L&#8722;1 of either EOs. Overall, fish exposed to ethanol and both EOs presented higher ventilatory frequencies (VF) than the control group throughout the 8 h of exposure. Net ion (Na+, K+ and Cl&#8722;) effluxes and ammonia excretion were significantly lower in fish exposed to 50, 100 or 200 µL L&#8722;1 of either EOs compared to control fish. Mortality was 37% in fish exposed to 200 µL L&#8722;1 of either EOs after 8 h. These findings suggest that EOCA and EOCL are useful anesthetics and sedatives for Rhamdia quelen, but their usefulness as alternatives to reduce stress in fish transportation at the lower concentrations tested (50-100 µL L&#8722;1) deserves further study.(AU)

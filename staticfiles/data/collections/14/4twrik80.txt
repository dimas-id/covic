Hepaticojejunostomy is a challenging and complex procedure to be done with confidence in conditions that contain a large number of segmental bile ducts. Portoenterostomy can be defined as the joining of multiple bile ducts into a single cavity using segmenter bile duct ends, stents, and surrounding connective tissues. During surgery, in cases with advanced stage biliary tract tumors that cannot be performed hepatectomy, after aggressive dissections to provide a negative surgical margin, a large number of segmental bile ducts can be revealed and needs to ensure the continuity of bile flow. Here, our clinical series of portoenterostomy (PE) in which we applied in patients who had aggressive hilar dissection and resection for hilar cholangiocarcinomas and biliary tract tumors were discussed. The study included 15 patients who underwent PE for biliary tract tumors and hilar cholangiocarcinomas between 2015 and 2019. Six of the patients had a tumor-negative surgical margin, with a mean follow-up of 14.4 months (range 2 to 28 months). Nine of the patients had a tumor-positive surgical margin, with a mean follow-up of 7.7 months (range 2 to 17 months). Portoenterostomy instead of hepaticojejunostomy in small and multiple biliary radicles and bile duct cancers has been successfully performed in 15 patients of bile duct cancer and Klatskin tumor. In the presence of active inflammation, fibrosis, major bile duct trauma, and thin bile duct radicles, this method, which is described in detail, provides an excellent salvage surgical procedure with less morbidity.

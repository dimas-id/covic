Considering the difference in the sizes of the infected clusters in the dynamic complex networks, the normalized entropy based on infected clusters ([Formula: see text]) is proposed to characterize the inhomogeneity of epidemic spreading. [Formula: see text] gives information on the variability of the infected clusters in the system. We investigate the variation in the inhomogeneity of the distribution of the epidemic with the absolute velocity v of moving agent, the infection density ρ, and the interaction radius r. By comparing [Formula: see text] in the dynamic networks with [Formula: see text] in homogeneous mode, the simulation experiments show that the inhomogeneity of epidemic spreading becomes smaller with the increase of v, ρ, r.

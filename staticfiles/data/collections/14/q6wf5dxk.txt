The goal of this protocol is to set up a preclinical model of bariatric surgery and, more specifically, OAGB in obese rats. Based on this preclinical model, longitudinal studies can be carried out to provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying the outcomes seen after bariatric surgery in humans. For this purpose, rats are operated on through a laparotomy under general anesthesia with isoflurane. First, the surgeon creates a long and tubular gastric pouch: after greater curve and hiatal dissection, the nonglandular stomach is stapled and removed. Then, the remaining stomach is also stapled in order to create a gastric tube and exclude the antrum of the stomach. After that, the surgeon performs a single end-to-side gastrojejunostomy 35 cm from the duodenojejunal angle. This limb length has been chosen in order to reproduce the same ratio between the biliopancreatic limb (BPL) and common limb (CL) length as in human bariatric surgery. The operation ends by aponeurotic and cutaneous closure. The early postoperative management consists of subcutaneous hydration, an intramuscular prophylactic antibiotic injection, a parietal injection of xylocaine, the administration of painkillers, and a progressive reintroduction of diet.

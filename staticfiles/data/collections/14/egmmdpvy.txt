Influenza A(H1N1) is caused by the conflict of interest between giant organisms and microorganisms. Influenza A and B viruses are single stranded RNA envelope virus composed of 890â€“2,341 nucleic acids in eight segmented genomes. Presently, only the virus subtypes of H1N1 and H3N2 still spread from human to human. The viruses spread and replicate under the following conditions: (1) the viruses enter the human body and duplicate there; (2) the viruses cause diseases; and (3) the viruses can easily spread from person to person. The H1N1 influenza viruses replicate is within only respiratory epithelial cells. The virus entering into the cells causes complex pathological changes of the cells. The columnar epithelial cells stop the self-synthesis of cellular component proteins. Therefore, the cells die due to their lack of necessary cell component proteins.

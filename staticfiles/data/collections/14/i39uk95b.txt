OBJECTIVE: Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, however a direct association with mortality has not been reported. We sought to determine whether obesity is a risk factor for mortality among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort, including patients with COVID-19 between March 1 and April 18, 2020. The primary objective was to determine if obesity is a predictor of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were included, 218 patients (91.6%) were African American, 113 (47.5%) were male, and the mean age was 58.5 years. Of the included patients, 146 (61.3%) were obese (BMI >30kg/m2 ), with 63 (26.5%), 29 (12.2%), and 54 (22.7%) with class 1, 2, and 3 obesity, respectively. Obesity was identified as a predictor for mortality (OR 1.7(1.1-2.8),p=0.016), as was male gender (OR 5.2(1.6-16.5),p=0.01) and older age (OR 3.6(2.0-6.3),p<0.0005). Obesity (OR 1.7(1.3-2.1),p<0.0005) and older age (OR 1.3(1.0-1.6),p=0.03) were also risk factors for hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity was found to be a significant predictor for mortality among inpatients with COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, and other comorbidities. Patients with obesity were also more likely to present with hypoxemia.

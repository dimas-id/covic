This paper evaluated the unique challenges of Australians in relation to the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The 2019-2020 bushfires and COVID-19 outbreak have increased rates of anxiety and distress in Australia. On the contrary, unprecedented spending by the Australian Government on health care, employment, and housing has potentially lowered anxiety and stress for some Australians. Research is required to monitor the potential long-term mental health consequences of COVID-19 in Australia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

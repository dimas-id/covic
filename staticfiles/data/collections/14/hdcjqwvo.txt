PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of combined pharmacotherapy to ONFH after high-dose corticosteroid therapy. METHOD From August 2003 to June 2015, five patients (ten hips) of ONFH in ARCO stage I, after SARS and Interstitial pneumonia, were treated by combined pharmacotherapy. Lipo-prostaglandin E1 10 μg iv Bid × 28 days, enoxaparin 6000 iu H QD × 12 weeks, alendronate sodium tablet 10 mg QD × 1 year. The patients were fully weight-bearing following completion of the follow-up. RESULT For these five patients (ten hips), Harris score was 100 from the diagnosis to final follow-up time. Radiologic findings show no signs of collapse, necrotic focus was repaired, and ARCO stages were changed from IC into IIB. CONCLUSION This combined pharmacotherapy has promising treatment results for delaying or preventing collapse of ONFH in ARCO stage I.

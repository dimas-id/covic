Survival of tick-borne encephalitis virus was studied from pasteurized and unpasteurized goat milk and from salted/unsalted and spiced/unspiced cheese made from goat milk inoculated with low and high litres of infective virus. Both soft (63 °C, 30 min) and fast (72 °C, 15 s) pasteurization conditions destroyed viable virus particles. A small amount of infective virus could be detected only for 5â10 days from milk, and from unsalted cheese. From milk inoculated with a higher amount of virus, infectious viral particles were detectable for 20â25 days and from unsalted cheese samples for 10â15 days, independently of the use of spices. Pasteurization and salt treatment made goat milk and cheese safely consumable. These two methods must be used when making any human food from goat milk to avoid milk-borne human TBEV infections.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has immensely strained the healthcare system worldwide. Diabetes has emerged as a major comorbidity in a large proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 and is associated with poor health outcomes. We aim to provide a practical guidance on screening of hyperglycemia in persons without known diabetes in low resource settings. METHODS: We reviewed the available guidelines on this subject and proposed an algorithm based on simple measures of blood glucose (BG) which can be implemented by healthcare workers with lesser expertise in low resource settings. RESULTS: We propose that every hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection undergo a paired capillary BG assessment (pre-meal and 2-h post-meal). Patients with pre-meal BG < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and post-meal BG < 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) may not merit further monitoring. On the other hand, those with one or more value above these thresholds should undergo capillary BG monitoring (pre-meals and 2 h after dinner) for the next 24 h. When two or more (≥50%) such values are significantly elevated [pre-meal ≥8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) and post-meal ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)], pharmacotherapy should be immediately initiated. On the other hand, in patients with modest elevation of one or more values [pre-meal 7.8–8.3 mmol/L (140–150 mg/dL) and post-meal 10.0–11.1 mmol/L (180–200 mg/dL)], dietary modifications should be initiated and pharmacotherapy considered only if BG control remains suboptimal. CONCLUSION: We highlight strategies for screening of hyperglycemia in persons without known diabetes treated for COVID-19 infection in low resource settings. This guidance may well be applied to other settings in the near future.

It is important to consider viruses in water quality because of their incidence as causal agents for diarrhoeal disease, and due to their characteristics, which allow them to survive in changing environmental conditions indefinitely. This study assessed the viral quality of the Umgeni River in South Africa seasonally. A two‐step tangential flow filtration process was setup to remove the bacteria and to concentrate the virus populations from large volume water samples. The concentrated water samples contained up to 659 and 550 pfu/mL of somatic and F‐RNA coliphages, respectively. Several virus families including Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae and Reoviridae were found in the river based on the morphologies examined under transmission electron microscopy. All concentrated water samples produced substantial cytopathic effects on the Vero, HEK 293, Hela and A549 cell lines. These results indicate the potential of viruses in the water samples especially from the lower catchment areas of the Umgeni River to infect human hosts throughout the year. The present study highlights the importance of routine environmental surveillance of human enteric viruses in water sources. This can contribute to a better understanding of the actual burden of disease on those who might be using the water directly without treatment.

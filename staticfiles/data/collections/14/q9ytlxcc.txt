OBJECTIVE To gauge Singapore physicians' perceptions of the national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak using a questionnaire survey. METHODS Random sampling was applied to draw the survey population. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were used. RESULTS The majority of physicians agreed that home quarantine of contacts of patients with probable SARS was warranted (95%), government's public education effort was effective (83%), and the overall Singapore's response was commendable (82%). Only 38%, however, agreed that health care workers were supplied with timely and adequate personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS Most Singapore physicians have positive comments about the national response to the SARS crisis. However, systematic weaknesses are identified and recommendations are presented.

PURPOSE Complications correlated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) of lung tumours were retrospectively reviewed to compare them with data from the literature and to assess risk factors related with the procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2003 to January 2009, 29 patients (36 lung lesions) were treated with RFA; from January 2007 to January 2009, 16 patients (17 lung lesions) were treated with MWA. Complications recorded at our institution are reported following the Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines. A systematic review of the literature was performed. RESULTS Any major complication of RFA or MWA was recorded. In agreement with the literature, pneumothorax was the most frequent complication, even though the incidence in our series was lower than reported in the literature (3.5% vs. 4.3-18%). Other complications of RFA were pleural effusion and subcutaneous emphysema. No massive haemorrhages, haemoptysis, abscesses, pneumonia, infections or tumour seeding were recorded in our series. The most common complication of MWA was pneumothorax (25% vs. 39% reported in the literature). Pleural effusion was a common reaction, but therapeutic drainage was never required. CONCLUSIONS Pneumothorax is the most common complication of both techniques. RFA and MWA are both excellent choices in terms of safety and tolerance.

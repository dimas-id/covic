PURPOSE OF REVIEW Pelvic reconstructive surgeons in the fields of urology, gynecology and urogynecology have continually adapted new techniques in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair in order to improve both anatomic and subjective outcomes. In the last 5 years, robotic surgery has gained a strong foothold in urologic oncology, gynecologic oncology, cardiothoracic surgery and now in female pelvic medicine. Robotic surgery has made its way into the armamentarium of POP treatment and has allowed pelvic surgeons to adapt the 'gold standard' technique of abdominal sacrocolpopexy to a minimally invasive approach with improved intraoperative morbidity and decreased convalescence. This review article aims to discuss the techniques of robotic prolapse repair as well as morbidity, cost and clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS The adaptation of minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of POP initially began with laparoscopy, something only those surgeons with extensive and advanced laparoscopic skills are able to accomplish. Access to robotic technology makes conversion from open or laparoscopic to robotic surgery much more feasible for most pelvic floor surgeons. There are currently no published randomized, controlled trials comparing robotic with open or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, however, there are several publications reporting both retrospective and prospective series of women undergoing robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy. SUMMARY Robotic-assisted pelvic floor surgery has become an important component of the pelvic surgeon's armamentarium in the treatment of symptomatic POP. Those pelvic surgeons without significant expertise in laparoscopy required for sacral dissection and intracorporeal suturing can readily learn the necessary techniques required for robotic surgery.

Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) protects against the progression of several cardiovascular diseases. Recent evidence suggests that some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors can be attributed to the activation of a distinct ACE signaling cascade rather than to the changes in angiotensin II and bradykinin levels. Moreover, at least one other ACE homolog (ACE2) plays a significant role in the regulation of heart and kidney function.

BACKGROUND The objective of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the results of 2 versions of laparoscopic ileal interposition (II) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and body mass index of 21-34 kg/m(2). METHODS The laparoscopic procedures were prospectively and randomly performed in 38 patients. Of the 38 patients, 18 underwent the first version (II-SG) and 20 underwent the second version in which a diversion of the second portion of the duodenum was applied (II-DSG) and a segment of ileum was interposed into the proximal duodenum. The groups were comparable regarding age (56 and 50 years); gender (13 men and 5 women and 14 men and 6 women); weight (78 and 86 kg); mean BMI (27 and 29 kg/m(2)); duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus (10.1 and 9.2 years); the presence of dyslipidemia (12 and 8 patients), micro- and macroalbuminuria (9 and 9 patients), hypertension (8 and 15 patients), and retinopathy (5 and 8 patients); and the use of antidiabetic medications and the hemoglobin A1c level (8.6% and 8.4%). All patients were followed up for >or=2 years. RESULTS The mean hospital stay was 3.4 days for the II-SG and 3.5 days for the II-DSG group. No patient required reoperation. All patients in both groups achieved lower levels of hemoglobin A1c. In the II-SG group, the mean hemoglobin A1c level was 6.35% (range 4.9-8.1). In the II-DSG group, the mean hemoglobin A1c level was 5.39% (range 4.2-6.5%). The mean BMI decreased in both groups to 22.2 kg/m(2) in the II-SG group and 22.7 kg/m(2) in the II-DSG group. Normal cholesterol levels (<200 mg/dL) were observed in 95% of the II-SG group and 100% of the II-DSG group. The triglycerides were lower than 150 mg/dL in 73% of the II-SG group and 90% of the II-DSG group after 24 months. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic II-SG and II-DSG were safe and effective operations for controlling type 2 diabetes mellitus in a nonobese (BMI 21-34 kg/m(2)) population.

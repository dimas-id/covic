The crucial participation of cellular RNA‐binding proteins (RBPs) in virtually all steps of virus infection has been known for decades. However, most of the studies characterizing this phenomenon have focused on well‐established RBPs harboring classical RNA‐binding domains (RBDs). Recent proteome‐wide approaches have greatly expanded the census of RBPs, discovering hundreds of proteins that interact with RNA through unconventional RBDs. These domains include protein–protein interaction platforms, enzymatic cores, and intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we compared the experimentally determined census of RBPs to gene ontology terms and literature, finding that 472 proteins have previous links with viruses. We discuss what these proteins are and what their roles in infection might be. We also review some of the pioneering examples of unorthodox RBPs whose RNA‐binding activity has been shown to be critical for virus infection. Finally, we highlight the potential of these proteins for host‐based therapies against viruses. RNA Interactions with Proteins and Other Molecules > Protein–RNA Interactions: Functional Implications.

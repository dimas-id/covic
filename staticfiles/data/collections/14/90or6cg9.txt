Study objective Videolaryngoscopes can be fitted either with channeled or non-channeled blades, which may result in a different performance and success of tracheal intubation. We investigated the characteristics of the two different blade types of the commercially available KingVisionâ„¢ videolaryngoscope. Design A prospective, randomized, single center investigation study in a urological operation unit of a tertiary hospital. Subjects and Methods Forty adult patients undergoing elective urological surgery in general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation were randomly allocated into group 1 (channeled videolaryngoscopy, n = 20) and group 2 (non-channeled videolaryngoscopy, n = 20). We measured the times from laryngoscope insertion to recognize the glottis and to conclude tracheal intubation. The number of laryngoscopy/intubation attempts and the degree of visual glottis exposure on a visual analog scale from 0 (glottis not visible) to 10 (glottis fully visible) was assessed. The lowest SpO2 value during airway management was recorded. Results There was no statistically significant difference in biometric data between the 2 groups. The time from the laryngoscope insertion to glottis recognition with the non-channeled blades was 5 (4-8) s as compared to the channeled ones with 11 (7-14) s (median and range; p = 0.01). Intubation duration was shorter with the channeled blades 17 (12-27) s vs. 29 (25-51) s (median and range; p < 0.001). Number of laryngoscopy/intubation attempts, grades for glottis visibility, intubation difficulty were not different. The lowest SpO2 was 98% in both groups. Conclusions Videolaryngoscopic glottis recognition time was longer and the total time to secure the airway was shorter with the channeled blades.

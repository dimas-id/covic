Sixty-nine fecal samples from diarrheic puppies were examined by reverse transcription-PCR assays for the M and the S genes of canine coronaviruses (CCoVs). The isolates in 10 samples were recognized as CCoV type I, and the isolates in 6 samples were recognized as CCoV type II, while isolates of both genotypes were simultaneously detected in 53 samples.

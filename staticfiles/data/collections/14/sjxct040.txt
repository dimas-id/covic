PURPOSE In endoscopic surgery, surgeons must manipulate an endoscope inside the body cavity to observe a large field-of-view while estimating the distance between surgical instruments and the affected area by reference to the size or motion of the surgical instruments in 2-D endoscopic images on a monitor. Therefore, there is a risk of the endoscope or surgical instruments physically damaging body tissues. To overcome this problem, we developed a Ø7- mm 3-D endoscope that can switch between providing front and front-diagonal view 3-D images by simply rotating its sleeves. METHODS This 3-D endoscope consists of a conventional 3-D endoscope and an outer and inner sleeve with a beam splitter and polarization plates. The beam splitter was used for visualizing both the front and front-diagonal view and was set at 25° to the outer sleeve's distal end in order to eliminate a blind spot common to both views. Polarization plates were used to avoid overlap of the two views. We measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), sharpness, chromatic aberration (CA), and viewing angle of this 3-D endoscope and evaluated its feasibility in vivo. RESULTS Compared to the conventional 3-D endoscope, SNR and sharpness of this 3-D endoscope decreased by 20 and 7 %, respectively. No significant difference was found in CA. The viewing angle for both the front and front-diagonal views was about 50°. In the in vivo experiment, this 3-D endoscope can provide clear 3-D images of both views by simply rotating its inner sleeve. CONCLUSIONS The developed 3-D endoscope can provide the front and front-diagonal view by simply rotating the inner sleeve, therefore the risk of damage to fragile body tissues can be significantly decreased.

Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is a fungus that causes the devastating fungalwheat stem rust disease in wheat production. Rapid identification of the physiological races of Pgt are very importance for the prevention of wheat stem rust. In this paper we developed a molecular method to identify the most prevalent race of Pgt, as a supplement for traditionally used host-specific methods. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was employed as a means of analyzing DNA polymorphisms in six common physiological races of Pgt in China and Ug99. In total, 64 pairs of primers were used for AFLP screening of race-specific molecular markers. One primer pair-namely, E7/M7 (5'-GACTGCGTACCAATTCG G-3'/5'-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAACGG-3')-yielded a unique band for the race 34MKG that was purified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector for sequencing. We then designed a new primer pairs (sequence-characterized amplified region marker) to amplify the 171-bp fragment and confirmed that the marker was highly specific for 34MKG. These results provide a new tool for monitoring different races of Pgt for improved control of wheat stem rust in China.

OBJECTIVE To describe disease presentation and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of Bernhoven hospital in Uden, the Netherlands. DESIGN Prospective, descriptive study. METHOD The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections. We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms. The number of co-infections is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th. RESULTS The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered. The average age was 71 years and 41% was female. The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine. Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%). In 54% of the COVID-19 patients at the ED, the temperature was ≥ 38,0°C, CRP ≥ 50 in 51%, leucocytosis in 12% and elevated LD in 61%. Of 31 patients 24 (77%) had an absolute lymphopenia. Co-infections were seen in 16% of patients. The mortality in the ED was 2% and ICU-admission 5%. On March 25th, 2020 the overall mortality was 22% and ICU-admission 15%. CONCLUSION We have seen patients with a very serious disease resulting in a high mortality and ICU-admission. Over 35% of patient did not have the typical symptoms of fever and respiratory complaints; atypical symptoms like chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea are frequently seen. There is no difference between patients over and under 70 years. COVID-19 patients can present with atypical symptoms, co-infections and distributed over various medical specialties.

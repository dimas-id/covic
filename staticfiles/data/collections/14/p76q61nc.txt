A 10-month-old female spayed mixed breed dog with a suspected vascular ring anomaly was presented for exercise intolerance and wheezing. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a double aortic arch. The smaller right aortic arch was successfully ligated via right 4th intercostal thoracotomy. The patient was discharged one day postoperatively and continued to have good outcome at recheck 3.5 weeks after surgery. This is the 4th documented case of double aortic arch with a successful outcome. Preoperative CT scan was vital in preoperative planning and should be strongly recommended in all cases of suspected vascular ring anomalies with atypical presentation.

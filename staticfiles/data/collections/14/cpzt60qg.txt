BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopy (SIL) has been developed to reduce surgical trauma, whereas technical difficulties in bleeding control limit the broad acceptance for hepatectomy. A novel minimized invasive strategy combining inline radiofrequency pre-coagulation and transumbilical SIL is presented herein. METHODS A cohort of 21 selected patients underwent transumbilical SIL hepatectomies (segmentectomies II-VI) utilizing inline radiofrequency pre-coagulation for hepatic transection (Habib 4X). Bleeding control, postoperative complications and positive resection margins in malignant diseases served as primary and secondary outcome parameters, respectively. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopy was successfully completed in all patients. A total of 33 segments were retrieved: mean resection time was 66 Â± 35 min, including 11 anatomical (52.38%) and 10 non-anatomical (47.62%) resections. Sixteen patients (76.19%) underwent concomitant abdominal surgery. No substantial blood loss occurred. Neither additional staplers nor clips were necessary to control any bleeding or bile leakage. One pleural effusion counted for the only postoperative complication. Free margins could be achieved in all but one resection (12/13 patients with malignancies; 92.31%). Ninety-day mortality was zero. CONCLUSIONS The combination of SIL and inline radiofrequency pre-coagulation proved to be a simple, efficacious and safe technique in minor hepatectomy.

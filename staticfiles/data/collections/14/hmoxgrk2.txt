Reye’s Syndrome (RS) was first documented by Douglas Reye and colleagues in 1963 as an “encephalopathy with fatty degeneration of the viscera,” a rare entity, but one that at that time was associated with an 80% mortality rate (Reye et al., 1963). Although the apparent incidence and outcome of the disease have improved, it continues to be one of the major causes of noninflammatory neurologic death after a viral illness in children (Sullivan-Boylai and Corey, 1981; Heubi et al., 1987).

The efficacy of an inactivated CCoV vaccine (Duramune PC) was evaluated in four pups. Two dogs were maintained non-vaccinated. Ten days after the booster shot all the pups were challenged with a field CCoV strain administered by oro-nasal route. The vaccinated pups did not display clinical signs and shed the challenge-virus for 11.25 days, evaluated by virus isolation, and 13.5 days, evaluated by PCR assay. The two non vaccinated pups displayed mild diarrhoea at day post-challenge 4 and shed the challenge-virus for 14 and 15 days respectively, by virus isolation, and for 22 and 24 days respectively, by PCR assay.

Abstract The high susceptibility of elderly to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) indicates how crucial it is to protect the elderly by various strategies. Aged BALB/c mice displayed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV and have been a valuable platform for evaluation of strategies against SARS-CoV infection. In this study, we confirmed the validity of this model using various methods, and verified that equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')2 can prevent aged animals from SARS-CoV infection. In a therapeutic setting, treatment with anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')2 decreased viral load more than several thousand folds in the lungs. Thus, this antibody should be a potential candidate for treatment of elderly patients suffering from SARS.

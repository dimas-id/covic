Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the frontline defense against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Inadequate knowledge and incorrect attitudes among HCWs can directly influence practices and lead to delayed diagnosis, poor infection control practice, and spread of disease. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perception, and attitude of the Egyptian HCWs towards the COVID-19 disease. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Egypt, among 407 HCWs using a self-administered questionnaire. The mean correct answer rate was 80.4% with a mean knowledge score of 18.5 Â± 2.7 out of 24. A positive correlation between knowledge and attitude scores was detected (r = 0.215, p < 0.001). About 83.1% of our participants reported that they were afraid of being infected with COVID-19, and 89.2% stated that they were more susceptible to COVID-19 infection as compared to others. Unavailability of personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of transmitting the disease to their families, and social stigma were the most frequently reported reasons for increased risk perception. The overall knowledge level of HCWs was generally good especially among physicians. A positive attitude was detected among allied health professionals more than physicians. Risk perception was high among HCWs. Causes of increased risk perception need to considered by the government and the Egyptian Ministry of Health.

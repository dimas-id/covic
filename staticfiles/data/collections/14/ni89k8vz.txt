Aneurysms that involve the internal carotid artery and posterior communicating artery junction and incorporate a fetal posterior cerebral artery are known as fetal posterior communicating artery aneurysms. We report the outcomes of four patients with fetal posterior communicating artery aneurysms who underwent treatment with the pipeline embolization device with or without adjunctive coil embolization. In our study, all four patients failed to achieve aneurysm occlusion at the last follow-up evaluation. Based on our results, we currently do not recommend the use of the flow diverter for the treatment of fetal posterior communicating artery aneurysms.

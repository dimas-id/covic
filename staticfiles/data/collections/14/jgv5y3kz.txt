The purpose of this article is to describe arterial and venous thromboembolism in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. Eight-two COVID patients with abdominal ultrasound or CT were retrospectively compared with non-COVID patients for thromboembolism and solid-organ infarction. Nine (11%) COVID-19 patients had thromboembolic findings with medium to large-sized arterial thrombi in 5/82. One non-COVID patient had known portal vein thrombus on CT. Thromboembolic findings occurred more frequently in patients with than without COVID-19 (p=0.02).

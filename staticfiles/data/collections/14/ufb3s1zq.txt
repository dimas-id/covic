Although transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is the standard procedure for the treatment of portal hypertension, it is often impossible to perform in patients with extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In these patients, options for decompressing the liver are few. In this report, we present a novel solution for managing gastro-esophageal hemorrhage in a child with portal hypertension and extrahepatic portal vein occlusion, through the creation of a percutaneous mesocaval shunt.

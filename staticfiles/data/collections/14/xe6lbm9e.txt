Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement has seen a rising trend over the past decade. Although effective in the prevention of future pulmonary emboli, filters are associated with several long-term complications including deep venous thrombosis, filter migration, filter fracture, and caval thrombosis. The IVC filters have evolved over the years to minimize these unwarranted sequelae. We describe a technique to remove a permanent IVC filter in a patient who no longer required mechanical protection.

The pol gene of all retroviruses is expressed as a gag-pol fusion protein which is proteolytically processed to produce all viral enzymes. In the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the gag and pol genes overlap by 241 nucleotides with pol in the -1 phase with respect to gag. The gag-pol fusion is produced via a -1 ribosomal frameshifting event that brings the overlapping, out-of-phase gag and pol genes into translational phase. Frameshifting occurs at a so called 'shift site' 8-10 nucleotides upstream of a hairpin loop which may play a role in the regulation of frameshifting. We have fused this region of HIV-1 to the 5' end of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in order to quantitatively measure ribosomal frameshifting both in cells and by in vitro translation. A series of 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides was designed to specifically bind the sequences which flank the gag-pol hairpin. Ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced up to 6 fold by those oligonucleotides which bind the area just 3 to the stem. Oligonucleotides which bind 5' to the stem have no effect on frameshift efficiency. In addition, we have constructed a series of fusion genes which mimic the effect of the bound oligonucleotides with intramolecular hairpins. The results suggest that increasing RNA secondary structure downstream of the shift site increases the frequency of ribosomal frameshifting, and that this effect can be mimicked by antisense oligonucleotides.

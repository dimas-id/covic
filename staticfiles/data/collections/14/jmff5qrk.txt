PURPOSE This study aims to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and its sociodemographic correlates. DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 5,926 subjects were randomly selected and interviewed. FINDINGS The overall 12-month and lifetime prevalence of GAD was 0.8%, and 1.2%, respectively. Being older than 25 years and female, lower education level, unemployed status, and lower (RMB2000/month) monthly income were associated with increased risk of GAD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS The low percentage of subjects treated for GAD indicates a major public health problem that should be addressed.

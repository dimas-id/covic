BACKGROUND Intraluminal erosion of a laparoscopic gastric band into the stomach has been reported as a complication of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. To our knowledge, however, intraluminal erosion of the band tubing into the duodenum has not been described. PATIENT AND METHODS We report a 46-year-old man in whom a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band tubing eroded into the duodenal lumen, causing recurrent port-site infections. This complication was diagnosed on upper endoscopy and also, in retrospect, on an upper gastrointestinal barium study and computed tomography. RESULTS The patient underwent surgical removal of the band and tubing, with a primary duodenal repair, and made a complete recovery without complications. CONCLUSION Erosion of laparoscopic band tubing into the duodenum should be included in the differential diagnosis for recurrent port-site infections after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Radiographic or endoscopic visualization of the intraluminal portion of the tubing may be required for confirmation. Definitive treatment of this complication entails surgical removal of the tubing from the duodenum.

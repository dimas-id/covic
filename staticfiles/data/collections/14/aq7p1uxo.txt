A collection of twelve organoselenium compounds, structural analogues of antioxidant drug ebselen were screened for inhibition of the papain-like protease (PLpro) from the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, CoV2). This cysteine protease, being responsible for the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids, plays a critical role in CoV2 replication and in assembly of new viral particles within human cells. The activity of the PLpro CoV2 is essential for the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it constitutes a key target for the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs. Here, we identified four strong inhibitors that bind favorably to the PLpro CoV2 with the IC50 in the nanomolar range.

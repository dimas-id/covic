This feature article sketches our long way from the development of dynamic heteroleptic coordination motifs to the self-sorting of multi-component libraries and finally the design of a new family of triangular nanomechanical switches, which are useful for ON-OFF control of catalysis and in bidirectional communication. Due to their orthogonal switching stations, the nanoswitches have evolved as powerful toggles to even control two catalytic processes in an alternate manner, ON-OFF photosensitization and redox-controlled communication in small networks. The near future will show whether these nanoswitches can be interdependently linked together in autonomously regulated catalytic networks.

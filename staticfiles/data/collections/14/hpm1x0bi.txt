Vaccination of animals for the prevention of infectious diseases has been practised for a number of years with little change in product composition. Recent advances in molecular biology, pathogenesis and immunology have laid the groundwork for the development of a new generation of veterinary vaccines based on pure subunits as well as live vectored bacteria and viruses. Along with novel methods of antigen preparation, the use of new adjuvants and delivery systems will permit targeting of the appropriate immune response as well as offering flexibility in terms of vaccination protocols. These new technologies are also being applied to the development of vaccines to enhance animal productivity and to control reproduction.

DNA can assemble into non-B form structures that stall replication and cause genomic instability. One such secondary structure results from an inverted DNA repeat that can assemble into hairpin and cruciform structures during DNA replication. Quasipalindromes (QP), imperfect inverted repeats, are sites of mutational hotspots. Quasipalindrome-associated mutations (QPMs) occur through a template-switch mechanism in which the replicative polymerase stalls at a QP site and uses the nascent strand as a template instead of the correct template strand. This mutational event causes the QP to become a perfect or more perfect inverted repeat. Since it is not fully understood how template-switch events are stimulated or repressed, we designed a high-throughput screen to discover drugs that affect these events. QP reporters were engineered in the Escherichia coli lacZ gene to allow us to study template-switch events specifically. We tested 700 compounds from the NIH Clinical Collection through a disk diffusion assay and identified 11 positive hits. One of the hits was azidothymidine (zidovudine, AZT), a thymidine analog and DNA chain terminator. The other ten were found to be fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which induce DNA-protein crosslinks. This work shows that our screen is useful in identifying small molecules that affect quasipalindrome-associated template-switch mutations. We are currently assessing more small molecule libraries and applying this method to study other types of mutations.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nucleoprotein (N) and membrane protein (M) were prepared and used for the comparative assessment of three blocking ELISA variants to detect TGEV. The competitive blocking ELISA format showed the highest sensitivity, allowing detection of 10(3) TCID(50) TGEV/ml in culture medium. Ninety‚Äênine porcine field faecal samples obtained from 37 herds affected with diarrhoea were examined, and various TGEV levels were found in nine samples from six herds. However, only in three samples were significant TGEV concentrations demonstrated. The relationship between incidence of TGEV gastroenteritis and the spread of porcine respiratory coronavirus infection in pig farms is discussed.

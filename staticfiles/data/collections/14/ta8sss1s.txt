The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a recent pandemic which has spread to over 200 countries of the world since its outbreak. As of 21st April, 2020, more than 2.3 million confirmed cases have been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a strategic preparedness response plan for countries at risk. This is based on the knowledge of previous epidemics and experience shared by Chinese health authorities. There is special emphasis on strict 'quarantine and isolation' of suspected/diagnosed cases. Pakistan is a developing country with a weak healthcare system. Pakistan Armed Forces have always provided services to the countrymen during natural and man-made disasters. During this pandemic the largest rehabilitation institute in the country was converted into a 130-bed dedicated isolation and quarantine facility for the COVID-19 patients. We will share our experience of establishing and managing this quarantine and isolation facility and highlight the achievements and out-of-the-box solutions applicable for low resource countries like Pakistan.

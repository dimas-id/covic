Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 subtype has given rise to serious damage in poultry industries in Asia. The virus has expanded its geographical range to Europe and Africa, posing a great risk to human health as well. For the control of avian influenza, a rapid diagnosis by detecting the causative virus and identifying its subtype is essential. In the present study, a rapid diagnosis kit combining immunochromatography with enzyme immunoassay which detects the H5 HA antigen of influenza A virus was developed using newly established anti-H5 HA monoclonal antibodies. The present kit specifically detected all of the H5 influenza viruses tested, and did not react with the other HA subtypes. H5 HA antigens were detected from swabs and tissue homogenates of chickens infected with HPAI virus strain A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (H5N1) from 2 days post inoculation. The kit showed enough sensitivity and specificity for the rapid diagnosis of HPAI.

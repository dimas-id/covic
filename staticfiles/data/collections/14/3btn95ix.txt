Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an acute, highly contagious enteric disease characterized by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in suckling piglets. A real-time reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RPA) was developed based on the nucleocapsid gene of PEDV. RT-RPA assay was performed at 40 Â°C for 20 min. The assay could detect both the classical and variant PEDV strains, and there was no cross-reaction with other pathogens tested. Using the in vitro transcribed PEDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 23 copies per reaction. The assay performance was evaluated by testing 76 clinical samples. PEDV RNA positive rate was 55.3% (42/76) by RT-RPA and 59.2% (45/76) by real-time RT-PCR. The diagnostic agreement between the two assays was 96.1% (73/76), and the R2 value of the two assays was 0.903 by linear regression analysis. The developed RT-RPA assay provides a useful alternative tool for simple, rapid and reliable detection of PEDV in resource-limited diagnostic laboratories and on-site facilities.

BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule with biological functions, has antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens including viruses. To our knowledge, little information is available about the regulatory effect of NO on porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection. This study was conducted to investigate the antiviral activity of NO generated from S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), during PCV2 infection of PK-15 cells and BALB/c mice. RESULTS: GSNO released considerable NO in the culture medium of PK-15 cells, and NO was scavenged by its scavenger hemoglobin (Hb) in a dose-dependent manner. NO strongly inhibited PCV2 replication in PK-15 cells, and the antiviral effect was reversed by Hb. An in vivo assay indicated that GSNO treatment reduced the progression of PCV2 infection in mice, evident as reductions in the percentages of PCV2-positive sera and tissue samples and in the viral DNA copies in serum samples. GSNO also improved the growth performance and immune organs (spleens and thymuses) of the PCV2-infected mice to some degree. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the NO-generating compound GSNO suppresses PCV2 infection in PK-15 cells and BALB/c mice, indicating that NO and its donor, GSNO, have potential value as antiviral drugs against PCV2 infection.

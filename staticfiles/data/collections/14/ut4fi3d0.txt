BACKGROUND Endotherapy in cases of neoplastic Barrett esophagus (BE) relapse after successful initial endoscopic management is commonly accepted, but few studies analyze this topic and also take into account the metachronous lesions. AIMS To evaluate the efficiency of endotherapy in the case of neoplastic BE relapse after successful complete endoscopic eradication of neoplastic BE and metaplastic BE. METHODS Retrospective review of medical records was collected in a computerized and prospective manner between 2000 and 2015, in a single tertiary care center. Recurrence was defined by histological presence of high-grade dysplasia or superficial adenocarcinoma at least 6 months after the end of successful initial endotherapy. RESULTS Eighteen patients were assessed (1F/17 M). Delay between initial treatment and relapse was 16.6 months (range 6-33). Endotherapy for relapse obtained a sustained and complete remission for 8/18 (44%) patients, with an average endoscopic follow-up of 28 months. The complication rate of endotherapy was 6%. Surgical management was required in 33% (2 pT2N0M0, 2 pTisN0M0, 1 pTm2N0M0 and 1 pTm3N0M0) and salvage radiochemotherapy in 17% (3/18). One patient treated by 6 sessions of ER was considered as a failure given the multiple sessions of endotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that length of BE (>5 cm), late stenosis adverse events and the quality of vertical margin during initial ER are predictive factors for disease-free survival (p value < 0.01, Hazard Ratio up to 0.076). CONCLUSION Endotherapy could be a treatment for management of neoplastic BE relapse, but should be carefully used, with strict follow-up.

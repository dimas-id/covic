Abstract The worldwide 2009â€“2010 pandemic of novel H1N1 influenza reminds us that influenza can still be a lethal disease. Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been the most devastating complications of this pathogen. We present a case of a previously healthy 40-year-old obese man who succumbed to H1N1-associated ARDS. In this focused review, we discuss the pathophysiologic peculiarities and management of acute lung injury/ARDS related to H1N1 infection.

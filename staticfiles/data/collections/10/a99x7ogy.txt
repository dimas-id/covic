Positron emission tomography (PET), is a medical imaging technique that provides functional information about physiological processes. The goal of PET is to reconstruct the distribution of the radioisotopes in the body by measuring the emitted photons. The computer methods are designed to solve the inverse problem known as “image reconstruction from projections.” In this paper, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm ART was regularized by combining Tikhonov and total variation regularizations. In the first step, combined regularization algorithm of total variation and Tikhonov regularization was applied to the image obtained by ART algorithm in each iteration for background noise removal with preserving edges. The quality measurements and visual inspections show a significant improvement in image quality compared to other algorithms.

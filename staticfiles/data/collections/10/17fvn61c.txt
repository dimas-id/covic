Brain-eating amoebae are known to harbor a plethora of viral, bacterial, protozoal, and fungal pathogens and safeguard these pathogens against disinfectants.

Here, we hypothesize that pursuing the host that harbor "terror cells" is a valuable approach in eradicating novel coronavirus in affected communities.

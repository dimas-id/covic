Abstract The target for a terrorist attack with a viral agent can range from humans to animals and plants. However, the use of a viral agent may pose a challenge due to problems associated with acquisition, cultivation, and dissemination. Agricultural targets are of concern as they would require relatively little specialized expertise and technology and can have large economic consequences. Viral agents are prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable with antimicrobials, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections.

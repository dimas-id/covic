The current outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 occurred in 2019, is in dire need of finding potential therapeutic agents. Recently, ongoing viral epidemic due to coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affected mainland China that now threatened to spread to populations in most countries of the world. In spite of this, there is currently no antiviral drug/ vaccine available against coronavirus infection, COVID-19. In the present study, computer-aided drug design-based screening to find out promising inhibitors against the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leads to infection, COVID-19. The lead therapeutic molecule was investigated through docking and molecular dynamics simulations. In this, binding affinity of noscapines(23B)-protease of SARS-CoV-2 complex was evaluated through MD simulations at different temperatures. Our research group has established that noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers; however, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and cough-suppressant. This study suggests for the first time that noscapine exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting viral protein synthesis.

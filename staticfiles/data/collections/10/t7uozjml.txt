Abstract Human enteric adenovirus Ad41 is associated with children gastroenteritis. To infect gastrointestinal cells, the invading virus must be acid-stable and resistant to inactivation by bile salts and proteases. In addition, it has to cross the mucus barrier before it infects mucosa cells. We show that Ad41 infectivity is not diminished by acid exposure, a condition limiting the infectivity of the respiratory Ad. This feature can be attributed to a large extent to the global basic charge of enteric Ad virions and to the stability of Ad41 fiber, a viral protein mediating virus attachment. Upon exposure to pH shock, the respiratory Ad2 loses its ability to interact with lipids while enteric Ad41 still binds to the major phospholipids of gastric and intestine mucus. In addition, contrary to respiratory Ad, enteric Ad41 interacts with several sphingolipid components of plasma membranes. These results show that the molecular bases of the Ad41 enteric tropism stem from its particular physicochemical properties.

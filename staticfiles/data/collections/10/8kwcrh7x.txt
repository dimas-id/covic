Smooth Brucella spp. share certain lipopolysaccharide antigens with other bacteria, resulting in serological cross-reactions which can prevent the definitive diagnosis of brucellosis. To identify other antigens with serodiagnostic potential, immunoblot studies following sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out. Sera from pigs experimentally infected with Brucella suis and naturally infected feral pigs, sera from pigs from a farm with a known history of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:9 infection, Brucella Complement Fixation Test (CFT) reactor pigs (aetiology unknown) and pigs from consistently Brucella CFT negative farms were examined. Although B. suis infected pigs recognized a total of nine B. melitensis antigens, individual pigs rarely recognized more than three antigens in the range. A 62 kDa antigen was recognized by the majority (73%) of the Brucella infected pigs, but only by 10 to 23% of pigs from the other groups. This antigen was shown to be the Brucella homologue of the ubiquitous 65 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-65) family by immunoblot studies with 14 monoclonal antibodies to the Mycobacterium leprae HSP-65. Only four of these monoclones (Y1.2, ML-30, D7C and IIIC8) identified the B. melitensis 62 kDa protein suggesting that unshared, potentially Brucella specific, regions exist. Sera from Y. enterocolitica 0:9 infected pigs, CFT reactor pigs (aetiology unknown), CFT negative pigs and hyperimmune pig serum raised to Y. enterocolitica 0:9 also recognized B. melitensis antigens, most notably a 17 kDa protein. This antigen appears to be a common cross-reactive protein.

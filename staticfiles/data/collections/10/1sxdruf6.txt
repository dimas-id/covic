Lifestyle medicine domains, despite accounting for more than 78% of chronic disease risk, are infrequently taught as a part of the medical curriculum. Aspects such as nutrition are taught in less than 25% of medical schools, a statistic that continues to decline, and less than 20% of practicing physicians were required to take even a single course in exercise counseling during their medical school training. To combat this lack of training, the American College of Lifestyle Medicine annually awards the Donald A. Pegg scholarship to fund the development of Lifestyle Medicine Interest Groups (LMIGs) across medical schools worldwide. This scholarship was initiated in 2016 and utilizes private funds to support the development and expansion of LMIGs with the aim of increasing awareness of lifestyle medicine among training practitioners. There are four award winners per year. To date there are sixteen Pegg Award winners. This article will showcase the four 2019-2020 Donald A. Pegg award recipients and their impact on the LMIGs at their institutions. Furthermore, it highlights the ingenuity and adaptation of these LMIGs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

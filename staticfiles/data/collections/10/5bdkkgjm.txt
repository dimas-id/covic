Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is not only one of the most economically important pathogen of poultry but also has a potential as anticancer virotherapy. The role of NDV V protein in virus-production kinetics was investigated using DF-1 cell-based production system. The presence of an anti-interferon (IFN)-alpha antibody resulted in enhanced NDV production kinetics in a dose-dependent manner by blocking binding of NDV-induced IFN to its receptor. To prepare DF-1 cell whose cellular IFN signaling is blocked efficiently, stable cell lines expressing either lentogenic or velogenic NDV V protein known as an IFN antagonist were established. The overexpression of NDV V protein enhanced NDV production kinetics and expedited the rate of NDV production, while it had no effect on Japanese encephalitis virus production. NDV V protein functions as an IFN antagonist by inhibiting the increase in type I IFNs by NDV infection. The IFN signals in cells expressing NDV V protein were weakened by decreased activation or expression of the dsRNA-activated enzymes. These IFN antagonist activities enhance rapid virus replication and spread in the early phase of viral infection and will be useful in improving the production of viral vaccine strains.

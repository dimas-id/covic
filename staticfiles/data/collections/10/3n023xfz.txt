Abstract Objective To study the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods A retrospective cohort of 78 consecutive adult SARS patients admitted to a regional hospital in Hong Kong between March and May 2003 was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, peak lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and clinical outcomes. Established adverse prognostic factors including old age, comorbidities and high LDH levels were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effect on adverse outcomes. Results Among 78 patients, 66 patients (84.6%) received corticosteroid. The LDH level was similar in both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (37.9% vs. 16.7%) despite younger age and less comorbidity. In multivariate analysis, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 20.7-fold increase in risk of either ICU admission or mortality, independent of age and disease severity. Conclusion Despite more favourable baseline characteristics and similar peak LDH levels, SARS patients given corticosteroid had more adverse outcomes.

Myocardial infarction is one of the most common human cerebrovascular conditions and frequently leads to ischemic stroke. Evidence has indicated that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a potential method for the diagnosis of patients with cardiovascular injury. However, the efficacy of MRI in diagnosing patients with myocardial infarction requires to be improved. In the present study, a novel nano-size contrast agent, a chitosan/Fe(3)O(4)-enclosed albumin (CFEA), was introduced that was used to quantify blood volume and permeability in the infarcted myocardium. A total of 68 patients with suspected myocardial infarction were recruited to analyze the efficacy of MRI combined with CFEA (MRI-CFEA). All patients received diagnosis by MRI and MRI-CFEA. It was revealed that MRI-CFEA provided a higher signal intensity than MRI in the same patients. It was demonstrated that the diagnostic efficacy of MRI-CFEA for patients with myocardial infarction was higher than that of MRI (P<0.05). By MRI-CFEA, 50/68 of cases with myocardial infarction were diagnosed, providing a significantly higher diagnostic rate compared with the 38/68 of cases diagnosed by contrast-enhanced MRI (P<0.01). MRI-CFEA successfully discriminated the infarcted regions based on a decreased fractional blood volume and increased permeability-surface (PS) area product in the infarcted myocardium. A pharmacodynamics analysis indicated that CFEA was eliminated within 24 h in all individuals. In conclusion, the present study provided a novel method to diagnose infarcted myocardium for patients with myocardial infarction, providing an imaging biomarker for the assessment of endothelial dysfunction in the clinic.

OBJECTIVE: To measure the awareness of COVID-19 infection among the general population following the outbreak in China. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out during January and February 2020 amongst the general population of Karachi, Pakistan. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used among 399 young adult participants. The questionnaire was developed keeping in view of the already published study on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the available literature on COVID-19. It included sociodemographic information, assessment of knowledge, beliefs regarding coronavirus and the perception of precautionary measures taken by an individual. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p<0.05 was used as statistically significant. RESULTS: There were more females 299 (75%) than male participants 100 (25%). The mean age was 20.9 Â±2.30 years and 232 (58%) had graduate degrees. There is lack of knowledge and awareness about coronavirus as 226 (56.6%) participants claimed that coronavirus is actually the most dangerous virus in the world, and 171 (43%) did know that the common flu virus is potentially more lethal than coronavirus. Although a large majority of participants correctly identified sources of transmission, measures and precautions to be taken for coronavirus, their knowledge for symptom identification was deficient. The most pursued platform for information for coronavirus was found to be social media, followed by television and print media. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the level of awareness of coronavirus among young adults in Karachi, Pakistan. The study further pointed out the public knowledge gaps for the authorities concerned to help them develop more effective and successful awareness campaigns using preferred channels.

Transradial access is being used with increasing frequency for interventional radiology procedures and offers several key advantages, including decreased access site complications and increased patient comfort. We report the technique of using transradial access to perform preoperative embolization of a humeral renal cell carcinoma metastasis and pathologic fracture. A transradial approach for performing humeral preoperative tumor embolization has not been previously reported, to our knowledge. In the appropriately selected patient, this approach may be safely used to perform upper extremity embolization.

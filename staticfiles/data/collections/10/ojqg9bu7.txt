INTRODUCTION Our knowledge of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pathogenesis is incomplete. The goal of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of measuring lower airways inflammation in patients with ARDS using repeated endotracheal aspirates (ETAs). METHODS ETAs were obtained within 24 hours by intensive care unit admission from 25 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS and 10 of them underwent a second ETA within 96 hours after the first sampling. In each sample, cell viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion method and the total and differential cell counts were measured using Neubauer-improved cell counting chamber and cytospins stained with Diff-Quik. RESULTS The median cell viability was 89 (IQR 80-93)%, with a median total cell count of 305 (IQR 130-1270)×103/mL and a median macrophage, neutrophil, lymphocyte and eosinophil count, respectively, of 19.8 (IQR 5.4-71.6)×103/mL; 279 (IQR 109-1213)×103/mL; 0 (IQR 0-0.188)×103/mL; 0 (IQR 0-1.050)×103/mL. Eosinophil count in the ETA correlated with the number of blood eosinophils (r=0.4840, p=0.0142). Cell viability and total and differential cell counts were neither significantly different in the second ETA compared with the first ETA nor were unaffected by the presence or absence of bacteria in the blood and/or ETA, or by the ARDS aetiology, apart from the macrophage count which was significantly increased in patients with ARDS associated with acute pancreatitis compared with those associated with pneumonia (p=0.0143). CONCLUSIONS ETA can be used to investigate the cellularity of the lower airways in patients with ARDS and it is an easy-to-perform and non-invasive procedure. Eosinophil counts in ETA and blood are significantly correlated. The number of macrophages in ETA may be affected by the aetiology of the ARDS.

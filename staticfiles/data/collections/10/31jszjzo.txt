COVID-19 is well known to everyone in the world. It has spread around the world. No vaccine or antiviral treatment is available till now. COVID-19 patients are increasing day by day. All countries have adopted social distancing as a preventive measure to reduce spread. It becomes necessary to estimate the number of peoples going to be affected with COVID-19 in advance so that necessary arrangements can be done. Mathematical models are used to provide early disease estimation based on limited parameters. In the present manuscript, a novel mathematical model with a social distancing parameter has been proposed to provide early COVID-19 spread estimation. The model has been validated with real data set. It has been observed that the proposed model is more accurate in spread estimation.

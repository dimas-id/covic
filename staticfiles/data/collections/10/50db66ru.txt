The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic makes us painfully perceive that our bullet shells are blank so far for fighting against severe human coronavirus (HCoV). In spite of vast research work, it is crystal clear that the evident does not warrant the commercial blossoming of anti-HCoV drugs. In this circumstance, drug repurposing and/or screening of databases are the only fastest option. This study is an initiative to recapitulate the medicinal chemistry of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim is to present an exquisite delineation of the current research from the perspective of a medicinal chemist to allow the rapid development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.

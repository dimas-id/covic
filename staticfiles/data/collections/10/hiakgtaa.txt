Single-port access laparoscopic surgery has recently emerged as a method to improve morbidity and cosmetic benefit of conventional laparoscopic surgery. Herein, we report the experience of transumbilical incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with one assist port in a 71-year-old man who had developed recurrent sigmoid volvulus in these several years since his first visit to the hospital. The patient presented abdominal distension and severe constipation. A plain x-ray film and CT of the abdomen showed grossly distended sigmoid colon loops and stenosis of recto-sigmoid colon. Sigmoid volvulus associated with megacolon was diagnosed and emergence endoscopic decompression was performed. After his condition improved, transumbilical incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was carried out as the minimally invasive approach, due to the several risk of patient such as aging and pulmonary disorder. Postoperative course was uneventful and on postoperative visit to the hospital he reported resolution of abdominal distension.

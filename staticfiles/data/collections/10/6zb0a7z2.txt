BACKGROUND Japanese encephalitis is a major public health problem in several parts of Asia, particularly India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar (Burma). Despite its public health implications, there are no effective antiviral drugs available. METHODS The present study evaluated the effect of mycophenolic acid on Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) using an in vitro cytopathic effect inhibition assay, plaque reduction assay and virus yield reduction assay, and its therapeutic potential was also assessed in vivo in a mouse model. RESULTS Analysis of the results obtained in the in vitro and in vivo experiments suggests that mycophenolic acid has significant antiviral activity against JEV, with an IC(50) of 3.1 Î¼g/ml, a therapeutic index of 16 and a 75% protection against lethal challenge of JEV. CONCLUSION The study concludes that this compound significantly inhibited the replication of JEV in vitro and protected mice in vivo.

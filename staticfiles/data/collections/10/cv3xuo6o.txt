OBJECTIVE The primary objective is to describe the long-term anatomic and subjective outcomes in women undergoing ventral rectopexy with sacrocolpo- or hysteropexy. The secondary objective is to describe the perioperative adverse events. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort of women who underwent ventral rectopexy with either concurrent sacrocolpo- or hysteropexy at a tertiary care center between 2009 and 2015. A composite outcome for recurrent pelvic organ prolapse and rectal prolapse was defined as subjective failure (vaginal or rectal prolapse symptoms), objective failure (prolapse to or beyond the hymen or full thickness rectal prolapse), or any retreatment for prolapse. Patient's Global Impression of Change was recorded at baseline and at all follow-up visits. Perioperative adverse events were defined a priori and collected up to 6 weeks after surgery. RESULT A total of 59 patients underwent a ventral rectopexy, either a sacrocolpopexy (48/59, 81.3%) or sacrohysteropexy (11/59, 18.6%). The median follow-up after surgery for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-76) with a composite success rate for both pelvic organ prolapse and rectal prolapse (estimated by Kaplan-Meier method) of 57.4%. Forty (91%) of 44 patients reported a Patient's Global Impression of Change score of 6 or 7, indicating significant improvement after surgery. Of the patients, 15 (25.4%) experienced a perioperative adverse event. Use of biologic graft was associated with a higher rate of adverse event (40.0% [95% confidence interval, 24.6-57.5] vs 10.3% [95% confidence interval, 3.6-26.3]; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Ventral rectopexy with sacrocolpo- or hysteropexy is associated with significant improvement in anatomic and subjective outcomes. One in 4 women experienced a perioperative adverse event.

Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses of extraordinary genetic complexity and diversity. In addition to a common set of genes for replicase and structural proteins, each coronavirus may carry multiple group-specific genes apparently acquired through relatively recent heterologous recombination events. Here we describe an accessory gene, ORF3, unique to canine coronavirus type I (CCoV-I) and characterize its product, glycoprotein gp3. Whereas ORF3 is conserved in CCoV-I, only remnants remain in CCoV-II and CCoV-II-derived porcine and feline coronaviruses. Our findings provide insight into the evolutionary history of coronavirus group 1a and into the dynamics of gain and loss of accessory genes.

Background: Dissecting the complex genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be key to both better understanding and optimally managing this most prevalent genetic cardiovascular disease. An array-based resequencing (ABR) assay was developed to facilitate genetic testing in HCM. Methods: An Affymetrix resequencing array and a single long-range PCR protocol were developed to cover the 3 most commonly affected genes in HCM, MYH7 (myosin, heavy chain 7, cardiac muscle, beta), MYBPC3 (myosin binding protein C, cardiac), and TNNT2 [troponin T type 2 (cardiac)]. Results: The assay detected the underlying point mutation in 23 of 24 reference samples and provided pointers toward identifying a G insertion and a 3-bp deletion. The comparability of array-based assay results to conventional capillary sequencing was â‰¥99.9%. Both techniques detected 1 heterozygous variant that was missed by the other method. Conclusions: The data provide evidence that ABR can substantially reduce the high workload previously associated with a genetic test for HCM. Therefore, the HCM array could facilitate large-scale studies aimed at broadening the understanding of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of HCM and related cardiomyopathies.

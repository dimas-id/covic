BACKGROUND Few data have been published on the combined use of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for outcome prediction in neonates cooled for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the predictive values and the most powerful predictive combinations of single aEEG and NIRS parameters and the respective cut-off values with regard to short-term outcomes in HIE II. METHODS aEEG and NIRS were prospectively studied at the Medical University of Vienna in the first 102 h of life with regard to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-two neonates diagnosed with HIE II treated with hypothermia were investigated. The measurement period was divided into 6-h epochs. According to MRI, 2 outcome groups were defined and predictive values of aEEG parameters, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), and the additional value of both methods combined were studied. Receiver operating curves (ROC) were obtained and area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated. ROC were then used to detect the optimal cut-off points, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. RESULTS At all time epochs, combined parameter scores were more predictive than single parameter scores. The highest AUC were observed between 18 and 60 h of cooling for the aEEG summation score (0.72-0.84) and for (background pattern + seizures) Ã— rScO2 (0.79-0.85). At 42-60 h sensitivity was similar between those 2 scores (87.5-90.0%), but the addition of NIRS to aEEG led to an increase in specificity (from 52.4-59.1% to 72.7-90.5%). CONCLUSIONS In HIE II, aEEG and NIRS are important predictors of short-term outcome. The combination of both methods improves prognostication. The highest predictive abilities were observed between 18 and 60 h of cooling.

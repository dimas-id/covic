At this point, little is known about local government responses to the economic crisis caused by COVID‐19. This crisis is happening on Main Streets around the nation. This article examines how some local governments are taking collective action in partnership with others as well as organizations at the local and regional levels. What is unique is that collective action is rare as it relates to traditional economic development practices, yet it is occurring and leading to the offerings of multi‐institutional grants and low interest loans.

Practitioners can learn about these collaborative economic development actions other governments are taking, and how these partnerships can stabilize their local economies.

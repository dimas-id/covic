Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an innovative mean of amalgamating medical devices and their applications to connect with the healthcare information technology systems by using networking technologies. We have explored the possibilities of confronting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by implementing the IoMT approach while offering treatment to orthopaedic patients. The data sharing, report monitoring, patients tracking, information gathering and analysis, hygiene medical care, etc. are the various cloud and connected network-based services of IoMT. It can completely change the working layout of the healthcare facilities while treating orthopaedic patients with a superior level of care and more satisfaction, especially during this pandemic COVID-19 lockdown. Remote-location healthcare has also become feasible with the proposed IoMT approach.

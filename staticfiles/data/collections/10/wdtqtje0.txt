BACKGROUND: Catechins, which are polyphenol compounds found in many plants and are an important component of tea leaves, are strong anti-oxidants. RESEARCH: Many studies seek to enhance the effects of catechins on the human body and boost their protective power against UV radiation. There are many examples of the positive anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergenic, and anti-cancer effects of catechins. Catechins increase the penetration and absorption of healthy functional foods and bio cosmetics into the body and the skin, thus improving their utility. High value-added anti-oxidant substances have been extracted from food and plant sludge, and experiments have shown that catechins are safe when applied to the human body. The stability of catechins is very important for their absorption into the human body and the effectiveness of their anti-oxidant properties. CONCLUSION: Continued research on the strong anti-oxidant effects of catechins is expected to result in many advances in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries.

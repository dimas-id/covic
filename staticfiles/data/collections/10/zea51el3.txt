415 male out-patients were studied by serological means (complement-fixation with various viral antigens, hemagglutination-inhibition with adenoviruses of subgroup II). The conclusion was reached that the viruses investigated do not play a major role in the natural history of chronic obstructive lung disease. This is based on the following observations: a. The rate of viral infections associated with respiratory disease or acute exacerbations of the bronchitis is low (see Tables 2 and 6). b. Respiratory disease before the first examination is not caused by these viruses to any appreciable extent (see Table 3). c. Antibody level in patients' sera against individual viruses or groups of viruses do not indicate protection against subsequent respiratory disease or against a deterioration of bronchial function (see Tables 4 and 5).

PURPOSE This study compared the results of laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer in obese patients with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or higher with those in nonobese patients (BMI <25 kg/m(2)) who were matched for clinicohistopathological factors. METHODS The oncologic outcomes were compared between 140 patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or higher (obese group) and 140 patients with a BMI of <25 kg/m(2) (nonobese group) that were matched for sex, tumor location, date of operation, and pTNM stage. RESULTS The proportion of patients with postoperative complications was significantly higher in the obese group (15 %) than in the nonobese group (6 %). The disease-free survival rate and overall survival rate in patients with stage I or II disease were similar in the obese group (98.6 and 98.8 %, respectively) and the nonobese group (97.8 and 97.8 %, respectively). The disease-free survival rate and overall survival rate in patients with stage III disease also did not differ significantly between the obese group (77.2 and 79.4 %, respectively) and the nonobese group (83.4 and 84.9 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative complications and long-term oncologic outcomes were similar in obese and nonobese patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer in this hospital.

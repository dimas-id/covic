Organ donors reflect the diverse US population, and there are an increasing number of donors born in, who have resided in, or who have traveled to underdeveloped areas of the world or areas with geographically restricted infections. As such, these donors are exposed to pathogens that can potentially be transmitted to recipients of the donorâ€™s organs. Additionally, there are newer techniques to identify many pathogens that may be transmitted from the donor to the transplant recipients. Finally, high-profile reports of several donor-derived infections have heightened awareness of donor-derived infections and have likely contributed to increased recognition. In this chapter, the incidence, methods of identification and prevention, and management of unexpected donor-derived infections will be reviewed.

With the increasing incidence of hematopoietic allogeneic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), the importance of securing a cellular product, safely from a donor, and ensuring that the product is without additional risk to the recipient, continues to be of paramount importance. The evaluation of the donorâ€™s medical eligibility and suitability is designed to identify and limit the risk of transmitting infectious, genetic, or neoplastic diseases to the recipient through the product. It also aims to ensure a maximum level of safety for the donor and informs them of the risks of donation. Several regulatory agencies, national and international registries, and accreditation bodies have facilitated the availability and safe provision of human cells, tissues, and cellular- and tissue-based products not only at local institutions but also through international exchange.

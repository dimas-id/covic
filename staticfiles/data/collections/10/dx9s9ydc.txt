INTRODUCTION Previous complicated abdominal surgeries such as pancreaticoduodenectomy with large abdominal incisions may keep the surgeons away from major laparoscopic procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study that shows the feasibility of major laparoscopic surgery in a patient with previous pancreaticoduodenectomy. CASE REPORT A 68-year-old female (BMI 27 kg/m2, ASA II), was admitted for anemia. Her medical history included an open pancreaticoduodenectomy four years ago for chronic pancreatitis. She had an abdominal Mercedes incision. Computed tomography and colonoscopy showed a 5-cm cecal mass with a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. We performed a totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and intracorporeal ileotransverse anastomosis. The specimen was extracted through the vagina. The operating time was 500 minutes and the blood loss was 400 ml. The patient was uneventfully discharged on postoperative day four. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic colon surgery can be feasible and safe despite previous extensive abdominal surgeries such as pancreaticoduodenectomy. Moreover, laparoscopic surgery in these cases can also be completed with intracorporeal anastomosis and specimen extraction through a natural orifice.

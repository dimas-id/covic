Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels responsible for the rapid neural and neuromuscular signal transmission. Although it is well documented that 16 subunits are encoded by the human genome, their presence in airway epithelial cells (AEC) remains poorly understood, and contribution to pathology is mainly discussed in the context of cancer. We analysed nAChR subunit expression in the human lung of smokers and non-smokers using transcriptomic data for whole lung tissues, isolated large AEC, and isolated small AEC. We identified differential expressions of nAChRs in terms of detection and repartition in the three modalities. Smoking-associated alterations were also unveiled. Then, we identified a nAChR transcriptomic print at a single cell level. Finally, we reported the localizations of detectable nAChRs in bronchi and large bronchioles. Thus, we compiled the first complete atlas of pulmonary nAChRs to open new avenues to further unravel the involvement of these receptors in lung homeostasis and respiratory diseases.

We created an approach for a smart living platform called ForeSight which consists of different modules: a service engineering module, a Web of Things (WoT)-based Internet of Things (IoT) module and an artificial intelligence (AI) component. This paper describes how openHAB, a smart home middleware, is extended to fulfill platform requirements related to a successful interaction with the IoT module of ForeSight, more precisely, to add identity and access management (IAM) to openHAB and comply with European privacy laws.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by pain, bleeding, cramping and altered gastrointestinal (GI) function. Changes in mucosal 5-HT (serotonin) signalling occur in animal models of colitis and in humans suffering from IBD. Melatonin is co-released with 5-HT from the mucosa and has a wide variety of actions in the GI tract. Here, we examined how melatonin signalling is affected by colitis and determined how this relates to 5-HT signalling. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using electroanalytical approaches, we investigated how 5-HT release, reuptake and availability as well as melatonin availability are altered in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Studies were conducted to explore if melatonin treatment during active colitis could reduce the severity of colitis. KEY RESULTS We observed an increase in 5-HT and a decrease in melatonin availability in DSS-induced colitis. A significant reduction in 5-HT reuptake was observed in DSS-induced colitis animals. A reduction in the content of 5-HT was observed, but no difference in tryptophan levels were observed. A reduction in deoxycholic acid-stimulated 5-HT availability and a significant reduction in mechanically-stimulated 5-HT and melatonin availability were observed in DSS-induced colitis. Orally or rectally administered melatonin once colitis was established did not significantly suppress inflammation. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our data suggest that DSS-induced colitis results in a reduction in melatonin availability and an increase in 5-HT availability, due to a reduction/loss of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 enzyme, 5-HT content and 5-HT transporters. Mechanosensory release was more susceptible to inflammation when compared with chemosensory release.

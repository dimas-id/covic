The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected health care service practices worldwide. Therefore, a global reaction to prepare health care systems is mandatory. Preventing the transmission of this virus during medical and dental procedures producing airborne particles and droplets, could be considered as one of the main venues in prevention of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in health care facilities. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention has been approved for this purpose, so the major suggestion in this regard is using personal preventive equipment (PPE) and similar measures as well as other sanitizing practices. Since we do not know how long we should face this universal issue, using antecedent pharmacotherapies for reducing oral-respiratory secretions to combat this virus might play a role in this regard. Given that currently there is no definitive cure for COVID-19, so we hypothesize that, considering drug solutions to reduce saliva and droplet production may be helpful in controlling Coronavirus spread during aerosol and respiratory droplet producing procedures.

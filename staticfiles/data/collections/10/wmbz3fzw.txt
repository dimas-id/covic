Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is the procedure with the fastest growing numbers worldwide. Although excellent weight loss can be achieved, one major obstacle of LSG is weight regain due to sleeve dilatation. Banded sleeve gastrectomy (BLSG) has been described as an option to counteract sleeve dilatation and ameliorate weight loss over time. In a retrospective study, we analysed 25 patients who underwent BLSG using a MiniMizer® ring. Twenty five patients who had previously undergone a conventional LSG were selected for matched-pair analysis. Patient follow-up was 12 months in both groups. Mean preoperative BMI was 56.1 ± 7.2 kg/m(2) for BLSG and 57.0 ± 6.3 kg/m(2) for LSG, P = 0.522. Operative time was significantly shorter for BLSG (53 ± 27 min vs. 68 ± 20 min, P = 0.0025). Excess weight loss (%EWL) was equal in both groups with %EWL at 12 months of 58.0 ± 14.6 % for BSLG patients vs. 58.4 ± 19.2 % for LSG patients. There was no procedure-related mortality in either group. At 12 months postoperative, vomiting was significantly increased in BSLG patients (OR 6.75, P = 0.035). New onset reflux was equal in both groups (OR 0.67, P = 0.469). Ring implantation does not increase the duration of surgery or early surgical complications. Weight loss in the first follow-up year is not influenced, but the incidence of vomiting is raised after 12 months when patients start to increase eating volume.

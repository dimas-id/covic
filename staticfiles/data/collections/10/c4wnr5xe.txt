Abstract A series of novel acyl-hydrazone (4a-d) and spirothiazolidinone (5a-d, 6a-d) derivatives of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole were synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral and antimycobacterial activity. The antituberculosis activity was evaluated by using the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay and the antiviral activity was evaluated against diverse viruses in mammalian cell cultures. According to the biological activity studies of the compounds, 5a-c displayed hope promising antitubercular activity, 6d was found as potent for Coxsackie B4 virus, 5d was found as effective against Feline corona and Feline herpes viruses. Consequently, the obtained results displayed that, 5a-d and 6d present a leading structure for future drug development due to its straightforward synthesis and relevant bioactivity.

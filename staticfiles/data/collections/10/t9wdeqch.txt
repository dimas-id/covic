Abstract Objectives To investigate possible differences in COVID-19 related anxiety based on previous theories in social psychology. Study Design Cross-sectional online questionnaire delivered via crowdworking platform. Method 407 (120 males and 287 females) adults (age >18) from the United Kingdom answered the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) "in light of the COVID-19 situation", followed by three health and three financial anxiety items. Results Our findings imply that: women are more anxious than men; people are more anxious about others than about themselves; their anxiety about relatives is higher than about strangers; and - that anxiety about health is higher than about financial issues. Conclusions We suggest that these preliminary findings should be further investigated to help policymakers improve both their treatment of pandemic-related anxiety and their messages.

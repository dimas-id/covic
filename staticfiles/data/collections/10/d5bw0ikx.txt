Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome (BHD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes patients to cutaneous tumors, pulmonary cysts with recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces, and a variety of renal neoplasms including hybrid oncocytic and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas. There has been much debate regarding the genetic link with the occurrence of colorectal cancer and other colonic anomalies. Associations between BHD and intestinal adenomatous polyposis and sigmoid diverticulosis have been described in the literature, but there have been no prior reports of appendiceal diverticulosis in patients with BHD. Here, we present a 40-year-old female patient with a known family history of BHD, who was found to have diverticulosis of the appendix and pulmonary blebs on computed tomography upon routine screening for renal and pulmonary abnormalities, suggesting additional focus be given to the gastrointestinal tract (including the appendix) at the time of CT assessment.

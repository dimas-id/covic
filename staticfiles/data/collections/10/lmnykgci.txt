Microwave (MW) ablation was used to treat 12 hepatocellular adenomas in six patients (five women and one man; mean age, 39.6 y). Mean treated tumor size was 2.7 cm ± 2.0. Tumor response was evaluated with serial cross-sectional imaging for a mean follow-up of 12.6 months ± 7.1. Primary treatment effectiveness and local tumor control were 100%. There were no instances of hemorrhage, malignant transformation, new hepatic tumors, or extrahepatic metastases. This early experience of treatment of hepatic adenomas by MW ablation demonstrates it to be a safe and feasible treatment modality at short-term follow-up. Continued investigation, including comparison with other treatment modalities, is warranted.

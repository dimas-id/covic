In the present report we provide the strain distribution patterns of susceptibility to acute mouse hepatitis virus type-4 (MHV-4) encephalomyelitis, acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and vasoactive amine sensitivity (VAAS) for 9 (CXJ) recombinant-inbred strains between BALB/cKe (C) and SJL/J (J) mice. We confirm that susceptibility to MHV-4 is not linked to the H-2 complex, and that all strains susceptible to acute EAE have both a responder H-2 haplotype (H-2(s) or H-2(d)) and induced (B. pertussis) VAAS. In addition, we provide evidence that susceptibility to acute EAE induction is controlled by an additional presently unmapped locus and that an EAE-like histopathological disease does not usually follow MHV-4 infection intracerebrally in animals susceptible to MHV-4, acute EAE and induced VAAS.

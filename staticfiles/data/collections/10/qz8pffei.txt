With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases and related deaths worldwide, we decided to share the development of this condition in Singapore and Malaysia. First few cases were diagnosed in the two countries at the end of January 2020, and the numbers have surged to thousands by end of March 2020. We will focus on strategies adopted by the government and also the Orthopaedic community of the two countries up till the beginning of April 2020. We hope that by sharing of relevant information and knowledge on how we are managing the COVID-19 condition, we can help other communities, and health care workers to more effectively overcome this pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Several workers have studied the effect of harvest time on chemical and nutritional composition of almonds, but the results are partly conflicting, probably due to differences in the cultivars considered and to different agronomic and climatic conditions in the growing areas. In this paper, the influence of harvest time and cultivar on the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill). D.A. Webb) were evaluated. Ten cultivars were considered, grown in the same orchard and subjected to the same agronomical regime. Almonds were collected at two different harvest times: (i) when the fruits were unripe, but already edible, and showed green and moist hull; and (ii) when the fruits were ripe, with dry brown hull. The analyses of proximate composition, fatty acid profile, total phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity were carried out. RESULTS: Lipid content increased (P < 0.001) during ripening, while both protein and carbohydrate content decreased (P < 0.01). Fatty acid composition showed a not univocal behavior during ripening and was highly influenced by cultivar. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity varied among cultivars but increased during ripening with the exception of cv Marcona. The ‘Genco’ and ‘Francolì’ cultivars were found to be phenolic rich. CONCLUSION: Harvest time and cultivar significantly influenced the chemical and nutritional composition of almonds. Genotype strongly influenced fatty acid composition and total phenolic compounds. The changes of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity suggest that the synthesis of antioxidants also occurs in the last stage of ripening. Unripe almonds, a valuable niche product, showed interesting nutritional value. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

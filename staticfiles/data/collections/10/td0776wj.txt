Bioinformatics and the ‘omics’ studies are rapidly changing the way scientific research is conducted. The genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics revolutions all have changed the quantity of the information available and have necessitated the embracement of bioinformatics as an integral part of modern-day science. This is no different in the infectious disease field where, arguably, most genome sequences originate. Here, we present large-scale studies that have resulted in vaccines that would not have been possible using the classical research approach. In addition, we provide an overview of methods available for those venturing into the area of next-generation sequencing.

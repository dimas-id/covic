The West Africa Ebola outbreak was the largest outbreak ever recorded, with over 28,000 reported infections; this devastating epidemic emphasized the need to understand the mechanisms to counteract virus infection. Here, we screen a library of nearly 400 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) against a biologically contained Ebola virus and identify several ISGs not previously known to affect Ebola virus infection. Overexpression of the top ten ISGs attenuates virus titers by up to 1000-fold. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that three ISGs interfere with virus entry, six affect viral transcription/replication, and two inhibit virion formation and budding. A comprehensive study of one ISG (CCDC92) that shows anti-Ebola activity in our screen reveals that CCDC92 can inhibit viral transcription and the formation of complete virions via an interaction with the viral protein NP. Our findings provide insights into Ebola virus infection that could be exploited for the development of therapeutics against this virus.

Despite accumulating knowledge of porcine macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) from in vitro studies, information regarding monocytes/macrophages and DCs in lymphoid tissues of enteric pathogen-infected neonatal animals in vivo is limited. In this study we evaluated the influence of commensal bacterial [two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. reuteri] colonization and rotavirus infection on distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and conventional DCs (cDCs) in ileum, spleen and blood. Gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with LAB and virulent Wa strain human rotavirus (HRV) (LAB+HRV+), HRV only (LAB−HRV+), LAB only (LAB+HRV−) or mock (LAB−HRV−). The cDCs were characterized as SWC3(+)CD11R1(+), whereas monocytes/macrophages were identified as SWC3(+)CD11R1(−) by flow cytometry in the gnotobiotic pigs at 10 days of age. Infection with HRV alone activated/recruited significantly more monocytes/macrophages to the intestine than LAB colonization and 56% versus 28% of these cells expressed CD14. Colonization with LAB alone also significantly increased the frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the CD14 expression on monocytes/macrophages in ileum and spleen compared to the controls. LAB colonization plus HRV infection significantly reduced macrophage and cDC frequencies in spleen compared to LAB colonization or HRV infection alone, suggesting that LAB colonization down-regulated HRV− infection-induced monocyte/macrophage activation/recruitment at the systemic lymphoid tissue. These results illustrated the distribution of porcine monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the frequencies of CD14 expression on these cells in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues in the early stage of immune responses to intestinal colonization by LAB versus infection by an enteric pathogen HRV and will facilitate further in vivo studies on functional characterization of these immune cells in neonates.

The recent spread of the Covid‐19 infection has raised important questions within the haematology community on how best to manage and treat patients with haematological malignancies, particularly acute leukaemias. Italy has witnessed a dramatic raise in infections and death rates, that has hit in particular certain areas of the most populated Northern regions of the country (Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna). Within the nationwide Campus ALL programme in the last week of March we sent a questionnaire addressing different issues related to the management of adult ALL patients during the Covid‐19 pandemic to 40 haematology centres located on the entire territory.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‚Äê19), caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread around the world. Invasive aspergillosis has been reported as a complication of severe influenza pneumonia among intensive care patients. Similarities between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia, together with limited published case series, suggest that aspergillosis may be an important complication of COVID-19. This report describes a case of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Aspergillus flavus in a patient with COVID-19 from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The Chinese hamster, also known as the striped-back or gray hamster, is indigenous to Northern Asia. Its small size, polyestrous cycle, short gestation period, and low chromosome number are among the biological attributes that have made it an invaluable laboratory animal for biomedical research. The Chinese hamster first played a role in infectious disease research to type pneumococci strains. It was subsequently used in a variety of infectious disease and epidemiological studies. With early attempts at inbreeding, a hereditary form of diabetes mellitus was identified in the species. The Chinese hamster subsequently became a useful tool for characterizing the metabolic disorder and developing therapies for the human disease. Due to its low chromosome number, Chinese hamster tissue cultures have been a popular research tool for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies. During the past 20 years, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been utilized to synthesize a wide array of recombinant protein products. Therapeutic proteins derived from CHO cells are currently used to treat numerous human diseases.

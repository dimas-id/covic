BACKGROUND Maternal obesity is a well-known risk factor for significant obstetric and neonatal complications. The influence of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the setting of maternal obesity during pregnancy is less understood. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the literature on the relationships between maternal obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) and the composition of maternal and child gastrointestinal microbiomes. METHOD We searched CINHAL, OVID Medline, Web of Science, and PubMed for relevant literature using medical subject heading terms related to obesity, pregnancy, and the gastrointestinal microbiome. We assessed 249 articles for potential inclusion using the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses framework and deemed 11 articles as relevant for this review. RESULTS Maternal obesity was associated with significant microbial changes in both maternal and infant fecal microbiome biospecimens including increases in Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and the Actinobacteria phyla and decreases in Bifidobacteria. However, inconsistencies in uniform taxonomic results across all studies mean that evidence of specific microbial associations with obesity and EGWG is inconclusive. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that both maternal and child gastrointestinal microbiome composition is altered in the setting of maternal obesity and EGWG during pregnancy. Future microbiome studies should concentrate on the investigation of metagenomic sequencing to elucidate microbial function rather than solely taxonomic composition. More diverse populations of mothers should be sampled to address health disparities and adverse outcomes of underrepresented populations. Finally, analytic pipelines should be standardized across studies to aid in reproducibility.

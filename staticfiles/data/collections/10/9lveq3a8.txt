The lungs are a frequent site of infectious diseases. Pleuropulmonary infections include bronchitis and bronchiolitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, cavity formation, allergic bronchopulmonary reaction, as well as pleural effusion and empyema. An accurate diagnosis of infection by means of cytology can be lifesaving. Sputum, lung FNA, bronchoscopic brushing, washing, and BAL are useful procedures that can help provide a fast, cost-effective, and noninvasive diagnosis of pulmonary infection. This chapter covers a wide variety of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections that involve the lower respiratory system.

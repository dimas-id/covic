A 6-year-old castrated mixed-breed cat was evaluated because of unilateral anterior uveitis. The cat was seronegative for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, coronaviruses, and feline immunodeficiency virus, and antigens for FeLV p27 and Cryptococcus neoformans. Antibodies to Bartonella spp were detected in serum and aqueous humor. The antibody coefficient (C value) for IgG antibodies to Bartonella spp in the aqueous humor was 4.42; values > 1 suggest ocular production of antibodies and supports a diagnosis of ocular infection. Topical administration of prednisolone and oral administration of prednisone failed to induce a response; however, the uveitis resolved rapidly after the cat was given doxycycline orally. Clinical or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency in this cat was not detected. Detection of a serum IgG antibody titer to Bartonella spp and ocular production of IgG antibodies to Bartonella spp, exclusion of other causes of uveitis, and response to doxycycline suggests that the cat may have had bartonellosis resulting in uveal tract inflammation.

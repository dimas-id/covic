PURPOSE OF REVIEW Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a frequent causative agent of nosocomial pneumonia. Because of important clinical consequences of inappropriate treatment, a current review of the potential modifications undergone by S. aureus and adaptation to new treatment options is necessary. RECENT FINDINGS Vancomycin has been considered the treatment of choice for pneumonia due to MRSA. However, detection of a progressive increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration for this antibiotic, its limited access to the lung parenchyma, and its considerable adverse effects have called into question its position. Linezolid has been shown to have a better pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. The prior uncertainty regarding the clinical superiority of linezolid appears to have been resolved with the publication of a recent trial. Linezolid achieved a higher clinical and microbiological response rate (the latter was not statistically significant), together with a lower incidence of all types of renal adverse effects in patients with nosocomial pneumonia, compared with vancomycin. Tigecycline, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin were inferior to the compared drug in their respective clinical trials. The clinical efficacy of telavancin was similar to that of vancomycin. The renal adverse effects of telavancin have to be clarified. Other drugs are efficacious against MRSA but their profile should be evaluated in nosocomial pneumonia. SUMMARY Current therapeutic alternatives for nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA appear to be limited to vancomycin and linezolid. However, vancomycin pitfalls, together with the apparent clinical superiority of linezolid, appear to restrict its indication. Telavancin could be a good alternative in patients without basal renal failure.

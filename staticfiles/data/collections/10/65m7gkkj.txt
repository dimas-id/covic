The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health threat. It is a respiratory disease, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is rare; however, if a patient develops severe AKI, renal replacement therapy (RRT) should be considered. Recently, we had a critically ill COVID-19 patient who developed severe AKI and needed continuous RRT (CRRT). To avoid the potential risk of infection from CRRT effluents, we measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic material in the effluents by qRT-PCR, and low copy numbers of the viral genome were detected. Due to unstable hemodynamic status in critically ill patients, CRRT should be the first choice for severe AKI in COVID-19 patients. We suggest prevention of clinical infection and control during administration of RRT in the acute phase of COVID-19 patients with AKI or multiple organ failure.

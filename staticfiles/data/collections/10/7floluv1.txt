A way to study the mutation pattern is to convert a 20-letter protein sequence into a scalar protein sequence, because the 20-letter protein sequence is neither vector nor scalar while a promising way to study patterns is in numerical domain. In this study, we use the amino-acid pair predictability to convert Î±-galactosidase A with its 137 mutations into scalar sequences, and analyse which amino-acid pairs are more sensitive to mutation. Our results show that the unpredictable amino-acid pairs are more sensitive to mutation, and the mutation trend is to narrow the difference between predicted and actual frequency of amino-acid pairs.

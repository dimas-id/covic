The propagation of a mouse-adapted strain, (67N) of haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in infected mice and murine cells was examined by viral re-isolation and immunostaining. Viral propagation was strictly limited to the neurons and to an established line of neuroblastoma cells in in-vivo and in-vitro experiments. These results provide adequate evidence that this virus is neurotropic.

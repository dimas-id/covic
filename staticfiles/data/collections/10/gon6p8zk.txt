INTRODUCTION Wheezing disorders are very common during childhood (particularly among preschool children), and represent a significant burden for patients, their families, the healthcare system, and society as a whole. Identifying wheezing phenotypes, and recognizing the risk factors associated with each, may help to predict long-term outcomes, distinguish high-risk children who may benefit from secondary prevention measures, and ensure that the most effective therapy is prescribed for each case. AREAS COVERED The main aim of this review is to analyze the characteristics of the drugs currently used to treat wheezing in preschool children, and discuss the results obtained in children with different wheezing phenotypes. EXPERT OPINION The continuous or intermittent administration of various oral or inhaled drugs could theoretically be effective in preventing or controlling wheezing in preschool children. However, the optimal management of acute preschool wheezing episodes has not yet been determined mainly because of their phenotypical heterogeneity.

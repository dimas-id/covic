INTRODUCTION At our institution, laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has been established as a technique for laparoscopic nephrectomy since 2011, and since 2012 in selected cases for adrenalectomy (AE) as well. AIM To compare LESS AE with standard laparoscopic AE (SLAE). MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 3/2012 and 7/2014, 35 adrenalectomies were performed. In 18 (51.4%), a LESS approach was chosen. Indications were strictly non-complicated cases (body mass index (BMI) < 34 kg/m(2), tumour ≤ 7 cm, non-malignant aetiology, no previous surgery). All LESS procedures were done by one surgeon. Standard equipment was a 10 mm rigid 0° camera, Triport+, one pre-bent grasper, and a sealing instrument. The approach was pararectal in all cases except one (transumbilical in a slim man). Three patients with LESS were excluded (2 partial AEs only, one adrenal cancer converted to SLAE and then to open surgery). These 15 LESS AE procedures were compared to 15 SLAEs with similar characteristics chosen among 54 SLAEs performed in the period 1/2008-2/2012. RESULTS In 8 cases (53.3%) of LESS AE, a 3 mm port was added to elevate the liver/spleen. Mean parameters of LESS AE vs. SLAE (Wilcoxon test): maximal tumour diameter 43.7 mm vs. 36.1 mm (p = 0.28), time of surgery 63.3 min vs. 55.3 min (p = 0.22), blood loss 38.0 ml vs. 38.0 ml (p = 0.38), BMI 26.9 kg/m(2) vs. 28.5 kg/m(2) (p = 0.13), discharge from hospital 5.4 days vs. 3.9 days (p = 0.038). There were no complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS The LESS AE is feasible in selected cases, especially small left-sided tumours in thin patients with no history of previous abdominal operations, but requires an additional port in half of the cases.

The first human lung transplantation (LuTX) was performed by Dr James Hardy (Hardy et al. 1963) in June 1960 at the University of Mississippi in a patient with unresectable lung cancer and obstructive pneumonitis. The patient received immunosuppression with azathioprine (Aza) and irradiation, but he died due to renal failure after 17 days.

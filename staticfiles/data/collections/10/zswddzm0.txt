Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered that cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine motif traffic readily to the cytosol and nucleus with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs are released efficiently from endosomes while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using a broad spectrum of techniques, including an RNA interference (RNAi) screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and confocal imaging, we identify VPS39—a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex—as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. Subsequent multi-color confocal imaging studies identify CPMPs within the endosomal lumen, particularly within the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of Rab7+ and Lamp1+ endosomes that are the products of HOPS-mediated fusion. These results suggest that CPMPs require HOPS to reach ILVs—an environment that serves as a prerequisite for efficient endosomal escape.

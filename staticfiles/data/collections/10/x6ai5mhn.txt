Bats have been identified as natural reservoirs of many viruses, including reoviruses. Recent studies have demonstrated the interspecies transmission of bat reoviruses to humans. In this study, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of six strains of mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) from Hipposideros and Myotis spp. These isolates were grouped into MRV serotype 1, 2 or 3 based on the sequences of the S1 gene, which encodes the outer coat protein Ïƒ1. Importantly, we found that three of six bat MRV strains shared high similarity with MRVs isolated from diseased minks, piglets or humans based on the S1 segment, suggesting that interspecies transmission has occurred between bats and humans or animals. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 10 segments showed that the genomic segments of these bat MRVs had different evolution lineages, suggesting that these bat MRVs may have arisen through reassortment of MRVs of different origins.

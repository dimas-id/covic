Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against the alfa subunit of interleukin (IL)‐4 receptor that blocks signalling from both IL‐4 and IL‐13, which are key type 2 cytokines in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis (AD). It shows good efficacy with a rapid response and good safety with few side effects. In a paper of Deleuran et al. the authors showed long term safety and efficacy of dupilumab; they reported viral upper respiratory tract infection, cough and influenza in about 2% of patients.

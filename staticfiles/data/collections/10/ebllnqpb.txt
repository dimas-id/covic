INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic pancreatic surgery is ambitious and should only be performed in institutions with expert knowledge in pancreatic surgery. METHODS Whereas pancreatic tail resection is routinely and safely performed in several institutions, the laparoscopic resection of the pancreatic head is only performed by a handful of surgeons. RESULTS In this article, we present our hybrid approach with complete laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreatic head resection and successive reconstruction via a small retrieval incision, which might combine the advantages of the laparoscopic resection with the safety of an open and routine pancreatic anastomosis.

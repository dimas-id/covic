Many virtual curricula for medical students focus on asynchronous assignments, text and video resources, and independent study to prepare for an examination. These methods perfectly mirror the structure of pre-clinical courses but do not reflect how knowledge is advanced in clinical workplaces, where students construct meaning through synchronous activities with peers, conversations with physicians, and feedback from teachers on their analysis of clinical problems. During the COVID19 pandemic, new instructional approaches are necessary when we shift clerkship students online but still aim to advance their thinking as novice physicians rather than increasingly sophisticated classroom students.

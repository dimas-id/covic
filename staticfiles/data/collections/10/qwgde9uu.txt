Abstract Whole mounts of intact virus-infected cells have been used for several decades to examine virus-cell relationships and virus structure. The general concept of studying virus structure in association with the host cell has recently been expanded to reveal interactions between viruses and the cytoskeleton. The procedure permits utilization of immuno-gold protocols using both the transmission and scanning electron microscopes. The grid-cell-culture technique is reviewed to explain how it can be exploited to provide valuable information about virus structure and replication in both diagnostic and research laboratories. The use of the technique at the research level is discussed using bluetongue virus as a model. The procedure can provide basic structural information about intact virions and additional data on the intracellular location of viruses and virus-specific structures and about the mode of virus release from infected cells. Application of immunoelectron microscopy reveals information on the protein composition of not only released virus particles but also cell surface and cytoskeletal-associated viruses and virus-specific structures. Collectively, this simple and physically gentle technique has provided information which would otherwise be difficult to obtain.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE The nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS)/candesartan cilexetil (N/C) combination was demonstrated to be an effective, well-tolerated antihypertensive therapy in a short-term study. The current study investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of N/C therapy in moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. METHODS A multinational, 70-centre, open-label study of N/C treatment for 28 or 52 weeks at a target dose of N60 mg/C32 mg. The primary assessment included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Efficacy assessments included change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 508 patients were enrolled, with 417 (82·1%) completing week 28 of treatment. Of these, 200 patients continued treatment, as planned, to week 52, with 193 (96·5%) completing this period. At least one TEAE or drug-related TEAE were reported in 76·8% and 45·3% patients up to week 28, and in 80·7% and 46·9% up to week 52/end of study. Most TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs to week 52 (93·9% and 95·4%, respectively) were mild or moderate in intensity. Rates of drug-related serious AEs were low (0·6%). TEAE-related discontinuations occurred in 10% patients before week 28 and in no additional patients thereafter. N/C provided substantial, sustained reductions in mean systolic and diastolic BP from baseline: 30·1 ± 18·4 and 12·8 ± 10·7 mmHg, respectively, at week 52. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS Nifedipine GITS/candesartan cilexetil FDC at the target dose of 60 mg/32 mg was well tolerated for a study duration up to 52 weeks and provided sustained reductions in systolic and diastolic BP.

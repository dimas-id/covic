Viral factories are novel structures built by viruses in infected cells. During their construction organelles are recruited and build a large scaffold for viral replication and morphogenesis. We have studied how a bunyavirus uses the Golgi to build the factory. With the help of confocal and 3D ultrastructural imaging together with molecular mapping in situ and in vitro we have characterized a tubular structure that harbours the viral replication complexes in a globular domain. Numerous ribonucleoproteins were released from purified tubes disrupted in vitro. Actin and myosin I were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting in isolated tubes while actin and the viral NSm non‐structural protein were detected in the tubes' internal proteinaceous scaffold by immunogold labelling. Studies with NSm deletion mutants and drugs affecting actin showed that both NSm and actin are key factors for tube and virus assembly in Golgi. Three‐dimensional reconstructions based on oriented serial sections of infected cells showed that tubes anchor cell organelles to Golgi stacks and make contacts with intracellular viruses. We propose that this new structure, unique among enveloped viruses, assembles in association with the most stable component of Golgi stacks, the actin‐containing matrix scaffold, connecting viral replication and morphogenesis inside viral factories.

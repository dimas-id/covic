BACKGROUND We compared surgical outcomes of LigaSure™ Small Jaw, which is a multifunctional thermal device that incorporates a tissue divider versus LigaSure Precise™ in thyroid surgery. METHODS A retrospective, single-center study was carried out in an acute-care teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Between January 2008 and June 2015, consecutive patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy were included in the study. Surgical outcomes were operative time, length of skin incision, use of a suction drain, intraoperative bleeding, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 2000 patients were included (LigaSure™ Small Jaw, n = 1000; LigaSure Precise™, n = 1000). Demographics and indication for surgery were similar in both groups. A significant and independent shorter operative time (median 40 vs. 65 min, P = 0.002), smaller length of the skin incision (mean [SD] 4 [2] vs. 7 [3] cm, P = 0.031), lower percentages of patients with suction drain (15% vs. 66%, P = 0.012) and intraoperative bleeding (4% vs. 9%, P = 0.045) and reduced length of stay (median 1 vs. 3 days, P = 0.039) were found in the LigaSure™ Small Jaw than in the LigaSure Precise™. Postoperative complications including haematoma, hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury were similar. CONCLUSIONS The LigaSure™ Small Jaw in thyroid surgery results in significant less blood loss and operative time as well as shorter hospital stay compared to LigaSure Precise™. These findings could have direct application in daily practice.

Knowledge graphs have become an essential source of entity-centric information for modern applications. Todayâ€™s KGs have reached a size of billions of RDF triples extracted from a variety of sources, including structured sources and text. While this definitely improves completeness, the inherent variety of sources leads to severe heterogeneity, negatively affecting data quality by introducing duplicate information. We present a novel technique for detecting synonymous properties in large knowledge graphs by mining interpretable definitions of properties using association rule mining. Relying on such shared definitions, our technique is able to mine even synonym rules that have only little support in the data. In particular, our extensive experiments on DBpedia and Wikidata show that our rule-based approach can outperform state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding techniques, while offering good interpretability through shared logical rules.

The spectrum of organisms known to cause respiratory infections is broad and constantly increasing as new pathogens are identified, and an increasing number of patients have impaired immunity due to disease or medications. The radiographic manifestations of a given organism may be variable depending on the immunologic status of the patient and the presence of pre- or coexisting lung disease. Moreover, the clinical data and radiographic findings often fail to lead to a definitive diagnosis of pneumonia because there are an extensive number of noninfectious processes associated with febrile pneumonitis. This chapter describes and illustrates the characteristic imaging manifestations of the most common community- acquired pneumonias, nosocomial pneumonias, and the various infections seen in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

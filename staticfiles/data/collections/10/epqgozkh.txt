Pigs are increasingly recognized to harbor a wide range of viruses that apparently establish long-term persistence in these animals. They serve as reservoirs for a number of human zoonotic diseases. In this study, a porcine astrovirus (PAstV) strain, designated as PAstV JWH-1, is identified from a diarrheal pig in China, and it is partially characterized genetically. Sequence analysis shows that the PAstV JWH-1 strain contains divergent nucleotide sequences in both the open reading frame (ORF)1b/ORF2 consensus and the 3â€²-UTR regions (s2m motif), which are usually highly conserved among members of the family Astroviridae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the JWH-1 strain clusters closely with newly identified strains PAstV 12-4 and 14-4 and forms a group of mamastroviruses with the proposed novel deer astrovirus. Further recombination analysis shows that two possible interspecies recombination events between porcine and deer astroviruses occurred in the genome of the JWH-1 strain. This study further confirms that multiple lineages are present among PAstVs, and each lineage likely represents an independent origin. Additionally, the possibility of interspecies transmission among PAstVs is also suggested.

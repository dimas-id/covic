OBJECTIVE Voice dysfunction is frequently reported after thyroidectomy even in absence of vocal fold paralysis. The energy-based devices such as Harmonic scalpel (HS) or LigaSure (LS) are commonly used in conventional thyroidectomy. The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term voice outcome after total thyroidectomy using energy based devices. METHODS Patients who underwent total thyroidectomy with or without central neck dissection for papillary thyroid carcinoma using HS or LS from April 2012 to March 2013 were involved. The videolaryngostroboscopy, acoustic analysis, voice range profile, voice perceptual evaluation, and voice handicap index-30 were obtained preoperatively, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1year after thyroidectomy. RESULTS Total 92 patients (HS group: 58 cases; LS group: 34 cases) were enrolled in this study. Demographics, tumor stage, and extent of operation were not significantly different between the HS and LS group. None of the patients evidenced any abnormalities at the pre- or postoperative videolaryngostroboscopic examination. The voice range profile (highest frequency), voice perceptual evaluation (grade, rough, and breathy), and voice handicap index-30 (total, functional, physical, and emotional) showed significantly worse scores in early postoperative period (<1month), but gradually returned to preoperative values. The all parameters of acoustic analysis, voice range profile, voice perceptual evaluation, and voice handicap index-30 were not significantly different between the HS and LS group. CONCLUSION The long-term voice change after thyroidectomy shows similar results regardless of the type of energy-based devices.

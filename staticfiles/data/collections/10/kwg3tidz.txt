BACKGROUND Current guidelines consider that bariatric surgery is relatively contraindicated in elderly adults (aged≥60 years). The objective of this study was to evaluate obesity-related morbidity after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) according to whether patients were aged≥60 years or<60 years. METHODS Forty-two patients aged≥60 years (the elderly group) were matched 1:2 with 84 patients aged<60 (the control group). The primary objective was to compare weight change and the remission rate of co-morbidities in the 2 groups after 24 months of follow-up. The secondary endpoints were short-term and midterm postoperative outcomes (operating time, the frequency of conversion to laparotomy, the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, mortality, and the SG failure rate). RESULTS No significant differences were observed between the elderly and control groups in terms of the mean operating time (83 minutes in both groups; P = .90), length of stay (3.2 versus 3.4 days, respectively; P = .51), morbidity rate (4.7% versus 9.5%, P = .35), or mortality rate (0% in both groups). The mean excess weight loss was significantly lower in the elderly group than in the control group at 12 months (56.2% versus 71.4%, respectively; P<.01) and 24 months (51.8% versus 73.5%, P<.01). Similar statistically significant differences were observed between the elderly group and control group for remission of metabolic syndrome (95% versus 90%, respectively; P = .55), type 2 diabetes mellitus (87% versus 71%, respectively; P = .13), hypertension (81% versus 77%, respectively; P = .71), and dyslipidemia (94% versus 74%, respectively; P = .09) at 24 months after SG. CONCLUSION Results support the safety and efficacy of SG for morbid obesity in patients aged≥60 years. In contrast to weight loss, the long-term morbidity rate and remission of obesity-related co-morbidities were similar in the participants aged≥60 years and those aged<60 years.

Pregnancy is known to increase the risk of severe illnesses in response to viral infections. Therefore, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestational ages might be detrimental and the potential vertical transmission should be thoroughly studied. Herein, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible and, in case, whether this results in a fetal involvement. Additionally, we analyzed the role of the antibody and the inflammatory responses in placenta and plasma from SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women and fetuses. 31 SARS-CoV-2 pregnant women were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed to detect the virus on maternal and newborns nasopharyngeal swabs, vaginal swabs, maternal and umbilical cord plasma, placenta and umbilical cord biopsies, amniotic fluids and milk. Maternal and umbilical cord plasma, and milk were tested for specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RNA expression quantification of genes involved in the inflammatory response was performed on four selected placentas. On maternal and umbilical cord plasma of the same subjects, secreted cytokines/chemokines were quantified. SARS-CoV-2 is found in at-term placentae and in the umbilical cord blood, in the vaginal mucosa of pregnant women and in milk. Furthermore, we report the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women, as well as in milk specimens. Finally, a specific inflammatory response is triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women at both systemic and placental level, and in umbilical cord blood plasma. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that in-utero vertical transmission is possible in SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. This is essential for defining proper obstetric management of COVID-19 pregnant women, or putative indications for mode and timing of delivery.

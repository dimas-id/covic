Epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum is uncommon disease, which is defined as the herniation of the mucosa and submucosa through the muscle layers of the esophageal wall in distal third of the esophagus. Traditionally, thoracotomy has been the preferred surgical approach. Recently, many surgeons have attempted minimally invasive surgeries for epiphrenic esophageal diverticula. They reported that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for epiphrenic esophageal diverticula was a safe and feasible approach which had many advantages. There are various options of surgical approaches for MIS of epiphrenic diverticula. However, the best surgical approach remains uncertain. We report the case of a huge epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum, which was successfully treated by single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Outbreak response can be viewed as a project for which the window of opportunity for planning is often quite limited Therefore, regular evaluation for sharing the lessons learned is crucial, especially in the cases of national and global crises As one of the major global concerns, the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has infected and killed many people in several countries worldwide Hence, it is worth analyzing the performance of different countries in this regard In this paper, the confirmed Case Fatality Rate (cCFR), and the confirmed Case Recovery Rate (cCRR) are considered as the main performance criteria, and the data are analyzed utilizing statistical confidence intervals (CIs) implemented in Python The results identify the regions with high cCFR and low cCRR, as well as the regions with low cCFR and high cCRR Finally, it is suggested to systematically transfer the knowledge and lessons learned from the high performing countries to where such information and knowledge is needed (C) 2020 by the authors;licensee Growing Science, Canada

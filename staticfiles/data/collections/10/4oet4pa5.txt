Objective: Asymptomatic carriers (AC) of the new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represent an important source of spread for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early diagnosis of these cases is a powerful tool to control the pandemic. Our objective was to characterize patients with AC status and identify associated sociodemographic factors. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design and the national database of daily occurrence of COVID-19, we characterized both socially and demographically all ACs. Additional Correspondence Analysis and Logistic Regression Model were performed to identify characteristics associated with AC state (OR, 95% CI). Results: 2338 ACs (11.8%; 95% CI, 11.3-12.2%) were identified, mainly in epidemiological week 18 [EW] (3.98; 3.24-4.90). Age [â‰¤]39 years (1.56; 1.42-1.72). Male sex (1.39; 1.26-1.53), cases imported from Argentina, Spain, Peru, Brazil, Costa Rica or Mexico (3.37; 1.47-7.71) and autochthonous cases (4.35 ; 2.12-8.93) increased the risk of identifying AC. We also identified groups of departments with moderate (3.68; 3.13-4.33) and strong (8.31; 6.10-7.46) association with AC. Discussion: Sociodemographic characteristics strongly associated with AC were identified, which may explain its epidemiological relevance and usefulness to optimize mass screening strategies and prevent person-to-person transmission.

Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) has emerged as a marker of T-helper cell type 2-mediated allergic airway inflammation. Recent studies suggest a role for Feno testing as a point-of-care tool in the management of patients with asthma. This Topics in Practice Management article reviews current coverage and reimbursement issues related to Feno testing and provides an overview of pertinent recent studies.

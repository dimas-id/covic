PURPOSE We outline our reinforced stapling technique for reconstruction after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG). We also investigated the safety and feasibility of short-term surgical outcomes of this technique for patients with gastric cancer (GC). MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective study of 24 consecutive patients with GC who underwent reinforced stapling technique for reconstruction after LDG at our institute between 2016 and 2017. We adopted intracorporeal anastomosis, namely delta-shaped Billroth I gastroduodenostomy or Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy, using reinforced staples with polyglycolic acid sheets (Neoveil). RESULTS No anastomosis-related complications (anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding) were found in our 24 consecutive patients. CONCLUSIONS Reinforced stapling for reconstruction after LDG is a feasible and safe procedure for GC with regard to short-term surgical outcomes.

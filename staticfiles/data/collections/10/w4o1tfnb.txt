Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experiencing respiratory symptoms have different complications (inflammatory, co-infection and thrombotic) that are identifiable by analytics patterns. Personalized treatment decisions decreased early mortality (OR 0.144, CI 0.03-0.686; p=0.015). Increasing age (OR 1.06; p=0.038) and therapeutic effort limitation (OR 9.684; p<0.001) were associated with higher mortality.

PURPOSE The right atrium is preferred over the superior vena cava (SVC) for tunnelled dialysis catheter (TDC) tip placement as it offers the best compromise between optimal catheter performance and complications. However, clinical practice guidelines are not all unanimous on this as a universal recommendation. Right atrial tip placement may also fail due to variations in body surface area, venous anatomy or TDC designs and lengths. Moreover, the presence of recurrent long intra-cardiac fibrin sheath or cardiac rhythm management device leads serves as contraindications. Extra-cardiac tip placement in the azygous, hepatic veins and lower segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an alternative but is invariably associated with poor blood flow and shortened patency. METHODS We report the concept of extra-cardiac tip placement into the larger calibre hepatic segment IVC via a transjugular approach in two diabetic haemodialysis patients with overestimated TDC length out of 380 insertions. RESULTS Blood flow was maintained above 250 ml/min for 5-6 months and no tip migration ensued. CONCLUSIONS The IVC upper segment is a reliable site for extra-cardiac tip placement in select cases but its safety and efficacy need to be further studied in larger clinical trials.

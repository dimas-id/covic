A novel coronavirus has been identified as the cause of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Previous phylogenetic analyses based on sequence alignments show that SARS‐CoVs form a new group distantly related to the other three groups of previously characterized coronaviruses. In this aritcle, a new approach based on the 2D graphical representation of the whole genome sequence is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses. The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the two‐dimensional curves. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 27: 1196–1202, 2006

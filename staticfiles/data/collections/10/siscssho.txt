Abstract During the past year, several examples of cellular mRNAs have been described in which translational initiation occurs by internal ribosome binding, a mechanism hitherto thought to be restricted to picornaviral RNAs. New insights into the molecular mechanism of internal ribosome entry have been provided by the structural and functional analyses of both the internal ribosome entry sites and the protein factors that stimulate translation mediated by these elements.

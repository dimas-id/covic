The reproduction of the new coronavirus HCoV/SPb/01/03 in the cultured human embryo lung fibroblasts (HELFBs) was electron microscopically studied. The virus was shown to replicate in the cultured HELFBs, by using for this a cell membrane system and causing profound changes in its morphology. After 24 hours of cell infection, there were mature and defective HCoVISPb/01/03 virions were detected in the vacuoles near the peripheral cisterns of the Golgi apparatus. Some of the vacuoles contained folded membranous structures along with virions.

In times of crisis, inequalities are more commonly exaggerated than ameliorated – meaning both that vulnerable populations are often forced to make do with what resources are at hand and that many of those who barely manage in ‘normal’ times are pushed beyond capability and opportunity thresholds. Indeed, new case definitions of vulnerability that emerge in a crisis may push previously unrecognized groups (e.g. service employees, ‘care’ facility residents) into extreme vulnerability, as borderline coping quickly becomes calamity coping. To understand emerging vulnerability, it is therefore critical for social scientists to have a seat at the table where scarce resources are being allocated – before, during and after a crisis.

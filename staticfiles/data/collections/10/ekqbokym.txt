INTRODUCTION Atraumatic avascular necrosis (AVN) is an unusual pathology to the foot. Risk factors include the use of corticosteroids, smoking, alcohol, rheumatologic disorders, hematologic disorders, and metabolic disorders. To the authors' knowledge, this study presents the first case of bilateral atraumatic AVN to the navicular and medial cuneiform in a patient with systemic lupus erythamatosus (SLE). CASE DESCRIPTION A 40-year-old man presented with a past medical history of SLE in which he developed AVN of the tarsal navicular and medial cuneiform. This occurred first on the subject's right foot and then while recovering from surgical intervention, on his left foot. Talonaviculocuneiform arthrodesis was performed with the use of distal tibial autograft on both extremities. The subject's American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score improved from 34 to 80 at 21 months on the right and 37 to 90 at 15 months to the left. DISCUSSION Patients with SLE carry a significant risk of developing AVN. Comorbidities such as vasculitis, corticosteroid use, cytotoxic medication, and peripheral neuropathy are known risk factors in the development of AVN. Unusual features such as multifocal AVN and unusual anatomic locations can occur with SLE. AVN of the foot is generally treated with surgical intervention. Treatments such as core decompression, open reduction and internal fixation, and arthrodesis have been recommended based on the symptoms and presentation. CONCLUSION The authors present a very rare presentation of bilateral osteonecrosis of the tarsal navicular and first cuneiform in a patient with SLE. The patient was treated with bilateral talonaviculocuneiform arthrodesis. The patient demonstrated considerable improvement to both extremities. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic, Level IV.

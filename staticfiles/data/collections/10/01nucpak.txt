The effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was examined in mouse glial cells in vitro. TNF induced MHC class I, but not class II, antigen expression on the surface of astrocytes but not on oligodendrocytes. Glial cells do not normally express detectable amounts of MHC antigens. Thus TNF may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of neurologic diseases that involve MHC class I-restricted reactions.

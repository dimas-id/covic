BACKGROUND We assessed the relationship between pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), troponin T (TropT) and nutritional status. METHODS A total of 48 chronic hemodialysis patients were grouped according to the presence [group A (GA); n = 24] or not [group B (GB)] of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS Compared to GB subjects, GA subjects were older, had been on hemodialysis for a longer period and had higher prevalences of vascular grafts, hypertension and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) [GA vs. GB: 1.1 (range 0.1-32.9) vs. 0.4 (0-28.1) mg/dl; p = 0.028], malnutrition inflammatory score (MIS) (GA vs. GB: 7.50 vs. 4.00; p = 0.001), pro-BNP [GA vs. GB: 6,760 (601-103,200) vs. 686 (75-83,700) pg/ml; p < 0.001] and TropT [GA vs. GB: 0.3650 (0.011-0.199) vs. 0.010 (0.0-0.290) ng/ml; p = 0.002]. Pro-BNP correlated with TropT (rho 0.539; p < 0.001), MIS (rho 0.502; p < 0.0001), homocysteine (rho 0.321; p = 0.13) and CRP (rho 0.511; p < 0.0001). Pro-BNP levels were lower in GB patients as the body mass index increased; the opposite occurred in GA. CONCLUSIONS Patients with cardiovascular disease had elevated pro-BNP and TropT levels. In patients without cardiovascular disease, malnutrition and inflammation were associated with vascular prostheses, while pro-BNP was lower in obese patients.

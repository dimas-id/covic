AIMS: This study evaluated pain associated with electronic probing comparing two commercially available probe tip designs using standardised force. MATERIAL & METHODS: Twenty adult patients with slight-moderate chronic periodontitis received periodontal probing using controlled-force electronic probe at 2 visits. In visit 1, a random arch was probed with either a ball-end (0.6mm diameter, 408 kPa; Test) or straight (0.45mm diameter, 726 kPa; Control) probe tip. The opposing arch was then probed using the other probe tip. Discomfort associated with each probing episode was recorded using visual analogue scale (VAS). 7 days later, tip assignments were alternated from visit 1 and VAS re-scored. VAS scores were compared by probe tip, arches and visits. RESULTS: Both tips provided similar VAS scores (median 13.5 for ball-end and 14 for straight, p=0.3713). However, the straight tip was associated with decreased VAS scores in the maxilla (p=0.01). Overall, VAS values did not differ by arch or study visit. Individual VAS scores showed high levels of correlation between study visits and between tips used (R2 =0.86 and 0.64, respectively, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Both probing approaches were associated with low levels of pain on probing. The straight tip, it may be perceived as more comfortable in the maxilla.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worsens, early case detection is vital to limiting community spread. We describe our experiences with four COVID-19 cases at the polyclinics in January and February 2020. This retrospective case series highlights the challenges primary care clinicians face in the early identification of suspect cases based on clinical criteria only. To improve case detection, clinicians can sharpen their clinical acumen by keeping abreast with the latest COVID-19 developments and by maintaining a high state of vigilance.

BACKGROUND: We report hereby a severe case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome‚Äù (HPS) induced by Maripa virus in French Guiana and describe the mechanism of severity of the human disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year- old patient started presenting a prodromic period with fever, dyspnea, cough and head ache. This clinical presentation was followed by a rapid respiratory, hemodynamic and renal failure leading to admission in the ICU. Biological exams revealed an increased haematocrit level with a paradoxical low protein level. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic monitoring showed a normal left ventricular function with low filling pressures, an elevated extravascular lung water index and pulmonary vascular permeability index. These findings were compatible with a capillary leak-syndrome (CLS). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of HPS caused by the virus Maripa in French Guiana can be explained by the tropism of hantavirus for the microvascular endothelial cell leading to a CLS.

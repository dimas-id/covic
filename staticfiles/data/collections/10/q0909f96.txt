PURPOSE This phase II prospective study investigates possible benefits of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with hepatic arterial chemoembolization using degradable starch microsphere (DSM) mixed with mitomycin C (MMC) in non-surgical candidates with colorectal liver metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study, approved by the respective institutional review board, included non-surgical candidates with 3 or fewer liver tumors of 3 cm or smaller, or a single lesion 5 cm or smaller. Percutaneous RFA was performed immediately after chemoembolization using DSM-MMC. Primary and secondary endpoints were the local tumor control rate, safety, and 2-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates. RESULTS This study examined 25 patients (22 males, 3 females) with 38 tumors of mean maximum diameter of 2.2 ± 0.9 cm (standard deviation) (range 1.0-4.2 cm). Their mean age was 70.2 ± 8.2 years (range 55-82 years). Local tumor progression developed in 3 tumors (7.9%, 3/38) of 3 patients (12%, 3/25) during the mean follow-up of 34.9 ± 9.2 months (range 18.3-50.1 months). The 2-year local tumor control rates were 92.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 81.4-100%] on a patient basis and 94.6% (95% CI, 87.3-100%) on a tumor basis. The respective 2-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 88.0% (95% CI, 75.3-98.5%) and 63.3% (95% CI, 44.2-82.5%), with median survival time of 48.4 months. Fever was the only adverse event requiring treatments in 2 patients (8%). CONCLUSIONS This combination therapy is safe, exhibiting strong anticancer effects on colorectal liver metastasis, which might contribute to patient survival.

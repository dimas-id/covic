Bio-inspired synthetic backbones leading to foldamers can provide effective biopolymer mimics with new and improved properties in a physiological environment, and in turn could serve as useful tools to study biology and lead to practical applications in the areas of diagnostics or therapeutics. Remarkable progress has been accomplished over the past 20 years with the discovery of many potent bioactive foldamers originating from diverse backbones and targeting a whole spectrum of bio(macro)molecules such as membranes, protein surfaces, and nucleic acids. These current achievements, future opportunities, and key challenges that remain are discussed in this article.

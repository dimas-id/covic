The pipelineâ„¢ embolization device (PED) is a braided, tubular, bimetallic endoluminal implant used for occlusion of intracranial aneurysms through flow disruption along the aneurysm neck. The authors report on two cases of giant internal carotid artery aneurysm treated with the PED. In the first case, an aneurysm measuring 26.4 mm was observed at the C3-C4 portion of the left internal carotid artery in a 64-year-old woman who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for dizziness and diplopia. In the second case, MRI showed an aneurysm measuring 25 mm at the C4-C5 portion of the right internal carotid artery in a 39-year-old woman with right ptosis and diplopia. Each giant aneurysm was treated with deployment of a PED (3.75 mm diameter/20 mm length and 4.5 mm diameter/25 mm length, respectively). Nine months later, both cases showed complete radiological occlusion of the giant intracranial aneurysm and sac shrinkage. We suggest that use of the PED can be a therapeutic option for giant intracranial aneurysms.

Paracetamol seems to have similar success rates compared with indomethacin and ibuprofen in closing patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants, but with a better safety profile. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible effects of paracetamol on cerebral oxygenation and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). Infants with gestational age < 32 weeks with hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) were prospectively studied by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) after the first dose of paracetamol (15 mg/kg) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg). Cerebral regional oxygenation (rSO2C) and fractional oxygen extraction ratio (FOEC) were recorded 30 min before (T0) and 60 ± 20 min (T1), 180 ± 30 min (T2), and 360 ± 30 min (T3) after the beginning of drug infusion. Moreover, mean flow velocity (Vmean) and resistance index (RI = PSV-DV/PSV) measured with Doppler ultrasound in pericallosal artery were recorded at the same times. Significant changes in rSO2C and FOEC were not found during the study period within and between the groups. Similarly, Vmean did not vary in infants treated with paracetamol or ibuprofen, while RI decreased in the ibuprofen group. CONCLUSION The treatment of hsPDA with paracetamol does not affect cerebral oxygenation in very preterm infants; there were no differences in cerebral oxygenation in infants treated with paracetamol or ibuprofen, although in the ibuprofen group, the possible closure progression of PDA was associated to changes of RI. What is Known: • Paracetamol has similar success rates to indomethacin and ibuprofen in closing PDA with a better safety profile since previous studies did not report adverse effects. What is New: • Paracetamol does not affect cerebral oxygenation and perfusion in very preterm infants with PDA and this confirms its good safety profile.

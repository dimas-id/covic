PTX3 is an essential component of humoral innate immunity, involved in resistance to selected pathogens and in the regulation of inflammation. PTX3 plasma levels are associated with poor outcome in systemic inflammatory conditions and vascular pathology. The present study was designed to assess expression and significance of PTX3 in COVID-19. By bioinformatics analysis of public databases PTX3 expression was detected in lung respiratory cell lines exposed to SARS-CoV-2. By analysis at single cell level of COVID-19 circulating mononuclear cells, we found that PTX3 was selectively expressed by monocytes among circulating leukocytes. Moreover, in lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, single cell analysis revealed selective expression of PTX3 in neutrophils and macrophages, which play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease. By immunohistochemistry, PTX3 was expressed by lung myelomocytic cells, type 2 pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells. PTX3 plasma levels were determined by ELISA in 96 consecutive patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Higher PTX3 plasma levels were observed in 52 (54.2%) patients admitted in ICU (median 21.0ng/mL, IQT 15.5-46.3 vs 12.4ng/mL IQT 6.1-20.2 in ward patients; p=0.0017) and in 22 (23%) patients died by 28 days (39.8ng/mL, IQT 20.2-75.7 vs 15.7ng/mL, IQT 8.2-21.6 in survivors; p=0.0001). After determining an optimal PTX3 cut-off for the primary outcome, the Kaplan-Meier curve showed an increased mortality in patients with PTX3>22.25ng/mL (Log-rank tests p<0.0001). In Cox regression model, PTX3>22.25ng/mL showed an adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) of 7.6 (95%CI2.45-23.76) in predicting mortality. Performing a multivariate logistic regression including all inflammatory markers (PTX3, ferritin, D-Dimer, IL-6, and CRP), PTX3 was the only marker significantly associated with death (aHR 1.13;95%CI1.02-1.24; p=0.021). The results reported here suggest that circulating and lung myelomonocytic cells are a major source of PTX3 and that PTX3 plasma levels can serve as a strong prognostic indicator of short-term mortality in COVID-19.

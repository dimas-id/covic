Since the beginning of March 2020, the cumulative numbers of cases of infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in Germany have been reported on a daily basis. The reports originate from national laws, according to which positive test findings must be submitted to the Federal Health Authorities, the Robert Koch Institute, via the local health authorities. Since an enormous number of unreported cases can be expected, the question of how widespread the disease has been in the population cannot be answered based on these administrative reports. Using mathematical modeling, however, estimates can be made. These estimates indicate that the small numbers of diagnostic tests carried out at the beginning of the outbreak overlooked considerable parts of the infection. In order to cover the initial phase of future waves of the disease, wide-spread and comprehensive tests are recommended.

The rapid introduction of new information and communication technologies into medical practice has prompted Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic SurgeryR to publish a position paper on sleep-disordered breathing, especially in relation to positive pressure treatment. It should be pointed out that the scientific literature is to some extent controversial due to a paucity of large randomized multicenter studies with long-term follow-up. Moreover, the telematics devices and systems on the market vary widely. As a result, the recommendations are based primarily on a consensus of expert professionals. Another very important aspect addressed extensively in this document is the obvious lack of regulations on legal matters and the operations of commercial companies. The most important recommendations included in this position paper are that telemedicine is primarily advocated in subjects with travel problems or who live far from the hospital, in patients with poor CPAP compliance, and in most cases treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation. A key element is patient individualization. It is imperative that the relevant technical, legal and ethical requirements (medical device regulations, data protection, and informed consent) are met. Finally, expert professionals from our society must contribute to and become involved in spearheading this technological change.

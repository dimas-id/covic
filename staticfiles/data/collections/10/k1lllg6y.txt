Dendritic cells (DCs) induce different types of immune responses depending on their lineage and activation signals. When exposed to inactivated pseudorabiesvirus (iPRV), plasmacytoid but not myeloid DCs released IFN-α and IL-12. Remarkably, both iPRV-pulsed DC types were able to induce primary IFN-γ producing T cells and IgG isotype switching in vivo. In contrast, tetanus toxoid pulsed DCs did not induce detectable primary immune responses. The efficacy of antiviral T and B cell priming proved dependent on the recipient's genotype. We conclude that either plasmacytoid or myeloid DCs pulsed with inactivated virus suffice to induce primary Th1-polarised immune responses.

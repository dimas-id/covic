Single-site surgery has gained significant interest in minimally invasive surgery, especially in the field of colon and rectal surgery. Robotic surgery has been found to provide a stable platform and better triangulation, minimizing instrument collision. Robotic single-incision sigmoid resections done at George Washington University Hospital were reviewed. Data including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), operative time, estimated blood loss, morbidity, and length of hospital stay were collected and reviewed. A total of four patients underwent single-incision robotic colectomy (SIRC) of the sigmoid colon. All cases were done for diverticulitis. One patient required an extra port site due to extensive adhesions. One patient experienced postoperative atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion. This initial review demonstrated that SIRC is safe and feasible.

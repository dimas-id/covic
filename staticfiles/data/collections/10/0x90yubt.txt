Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the sars-cov-2 strain of coronavirus, has affected millions of people all over the world and taken thousands of lives. It is of utmost importance that the character of this deadly virus be studied and its nature be analysed. We present here an analysis pipeline comprising phylogenetic analysis on strains of this novel virus to track its evolutionary history among the countries uncovering several interesting relationships, followed by a classification exercise to identify the virulence of the strains and extraction of important features from its genetic material that are used subsequently to predict mutation at those interesting sites using deep learning techniques. In a nutshell, we have prepared an analysis pipeline for hCov genome sequences leveraging the power of machine intelligence and uncovered what remained apparently shrouded by raw data.

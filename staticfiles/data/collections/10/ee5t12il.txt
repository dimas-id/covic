BACKGROUND To assess the short-term outcomes of intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil) compared with extracorporeal circular Roux-en-Y anastomosis during laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for gastric cancer. METHODS From January 2011-April 2014, a total of 165 consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent either intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy (n = 25) using the Orvil or extracorporeal circular anastomosis (n = 140) during LTG. After generating propensity scores with six covariates, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor location, and tumor size, 25 patients undergoing the OrVil method (intracorporeal group) were one-to-one matched with 25 patients undergoing the extracorporeal method (extracorporeal group). The short-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Both groups were balanced regarding baseline variables. The total operative time was not significantly different between the two groups (216.5 ± 24.9 min versus 224.0 ± 30.5 min, P = 0.344), whereas either the duration of anvil insertion (9.9 ± 2.4 min versus 12.9 ± 2.0 min, P < 0.001) or reconstruction completion (44.4 ± 9.4 min versus 50.1 ± 5.4 min, P = 0.012) in the intracorporeal group was less. The mean length of minilaparotomy in the intracorporeal group was shorter (5.6 ± 0.4 cm versus 7.2 ± 1.7 cm, P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in intraoperative complication rate, estimated blood loss, length of proximal margin, or postoperative recovery course (including the time to first flatus, liquid resumption, liquid, and soft diet) between the two groups. No patients suffered from anastomosis-related complications. The overall morbidity rates of 28.0% in the intracorporeal group and 32.0% in the extracorporeal group were comparable (P = 0.758). CONCLUSIONS Intracorporeal Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy using the transorally inserted anvil system may be a safe procedure during LTG for gastric cancer. However, a longer follow-up in a well-designed randomized controlled trial is necessary to more thoroughly evaluate this technique.

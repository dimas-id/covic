Edible packaging is influenced by factors such as formulation, production technology, and solvent and additive properties. With the increase in the request for coating and film quality, appropriate form, and high product safety and storage period, various technologies such as high hydrostatic pressure, irradiation, ultrasound, high-pressure homogenization, cold plasma, and microwave have been reviewed. The present study states definitions and mechanisms of novel technologies. The experimental condition, packaging matrix, and the results pertaining to the effects of these technologies on various types of edible packaging is also discussed. The most of the matrix used for packaging was whey protein, soy protein isolate, chitosan, and gelatin. The technologies conditions such as power, frequency, time, temperature, dose, pressure, and voltage can have a significant influence on the application of them in film and coating. Therefore, finding the optimum point for the features of the technologies is important because improper use of them reduces the properties of the edible packaging.

The title compound, C(23)H(25)BrN(2)O(3), crystallizes with two independent mol­ecules in the asymmetric unit (Z′ = 2) which differ in the twist of the 5-bromo-1H-indole ring with respect to the plane of the 4-methyl-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexa­hydro­quinoline ring [dihedral angles of 78.55 (9) and 89.70 (8)° in molecules A and B, respectively]. The indole ring is planar in both molecules [maximum deviations = 0.021 (3) and −0.020 (3) Å for the N atom] while the cyclo­hexene ring has adopts a sofa conformation. In the crystal, mol­ecules are linked by pairs of N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming dimers with R (1) (2)(6) ring motifs. These dimers are connected by N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, generating chains along [110]. A C—H⋯O contact occurs between the independent mol­ecules.

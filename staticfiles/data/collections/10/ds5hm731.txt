Publisher Summary This chapter discusses various drugs for human influenza A (H5N1) and multidrug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The H5N1 avian influenza does not presently meet the criteria of an antigenically shifted strain. It is presently an avian strain that has not undergone reassortment with a human strain and is not well adapted to humans. H5N1 isolates are resistant to the M2 inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine; these antivirals do not have a role for the treatment or prophylaxis against the strain. The neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, have in vitro activities against the human H5N1 isolates; however, recent data suggest that higher doses for longer periods may be required to be effective. Oseltamivir is an oral agent approved for prophylaxis and the treatment of influenza infections. Zanamivir is delivered topically to the respiratory tract with similar indications. The drugs discussed in the chapter for MDR-TB fall into three categoriesâ€”quinolones, nitroimidazoles, and pyrroles. Drugs such as moxifloxacin are methoxyfluoroquinolones, which are already available and approved for the treatment of acute respiratory infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, acute sinusitis, and skin infections. Gatifloxacin 5, is another methoxyfluoroquinolone that is in clinical development for tuberculosis treatment.

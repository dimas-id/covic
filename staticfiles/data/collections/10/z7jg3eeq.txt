Recent increasing number of travelers, immigrants and foreign workers from schistosomiasis endemic area has thus resulted in the importation of schistosomiasis to non-endemic countries. To avoid ova-induced pathogenicity, sensitive and specific diagnostic means at an early stage of infection are therefore crucial. In this study, we developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific for human schistosome species. The PCR products were obtained in a species-specific manner (479 bp, Schistosoma mansoni; 365 bp, S. haematobium; 614 bp, S. japonicum; 303 bp, S. mekongi) and were detectable from 0.01 pg of total worm DNA (S. haematobium, S. japonicum, S. mekongi). The primer sets were also available for multiplex use. Although some difficulties were experienced in amplifying the parasite DNA from the infected animals, schistosome DNA could be detected from one day post infection. The PCR method described herein will therefore be beneficial to detect human schistosomiasis, after some improvements in this method.

PURPOSE The management of residual or persistent intracranial aneurysms after flow-diversion therapy is not well defined in the literature. In this multicentric study, we report clinical and angiographic outcomes of 11 patients that underwent retreatment for 12 aneurysms initially treated with flow-diverter stents. METHODS The median patient age was 53 years. Aneurysms (median size, 7.3 mm) were located at the internal carotid artery in 9 cases, and at the posterior circulation in 3. Treatment strategies, complications, and angiographic outcome were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS Retreatment was feasible in all cases and performed by overlapping flow-diverter implantation. Overall, 12 side vessels were covered during retreatment, whereof 10 (83.3%) remained patent until mid-term follow-up. There were no further technical or symptomatic complications and no treatment-related morbidity. Angiographic follow-up (median, 17 months) showed improved aneurysm occlusion in all patients. Complete or near-complete aneurysm occlusion was achieved in 11 aneurysms (91.7%). CONCLUSION Required retreatment after failed flow-diversion therapy can be performed with adequate safety and efficacy by placement of additional flow-diverter stents.

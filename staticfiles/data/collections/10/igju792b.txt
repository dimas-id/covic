PURPOSE Most commonly employed for surgery of the gallbladder and appendix, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is rapidly evolving in the field of minimally invasive surgery. The purpose of this report is to describe the feasibility and technique for SILS right hemicolectomy, which has not been widely reported. METHODS We describe a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with a modified single-incision technique for the management of a precancerous polyp of the ascending colon. RESULTS The procedure was successfully performed in 105 minutes using 3 transumbilical trocars placed through a single port, and readily available nonarticulating laparoscopic instruments. In addition, we review the literature of SILS procedures involving the colon and discuss differences between our approach and those reported elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS SILS is a feasible modality applicable to minimally invasive surgery of the colon and can offer benefits to the patient.

PURPOSE Totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG) is unpopular because reconstruction is difficult. In fact, esophagojejunostomy is the most difficult surgical technique in TLTG. We adopted functional end-to-end anastomosis for esophagojejunostomy to simplify the procedure. The present study assesses the feasibility and surgical outcomes of TLTG with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy. METHODS We assessed the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes of 65 consecutive patients who underwent TLTG with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy at Tonan Hospital between January 2006 and August 2011. RESULTS The mean surgical duration was 271.5 ± 64.7 min, and the mean blood loss was 85.2 ± 143.2 g. One patient (1.5 %) was converted to open surgery, and two patients (3.1 %) required reoperation due to ileus because of an internal hernia and jejunojejunostomy leakage. No reoperation was associated with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy. The mean hospital stay was 21.4 ± 13.5 days. Ten patients (15.4 %) developed postoperative complications, of which three (4.6 %) were anastomotic stenosis associated with functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy. All of these were resolved by endoscopic dilation. CONCLUSION Functional end-to-end esophagojejunostomy in TLTG is safe and feasible.

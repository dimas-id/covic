ABSTRACT Introduction: Individuals who have knowledge of an infectious disease and also perceive the risks associated with such infectious disease tend to engage more in precautionary behaviour; however, little is known about this association as it relates to the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). There is possibility of moderated mediation effect in the association between these variables. Objectives: To examine whether risk perception determines the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behaviour among Nigerians, taking into consideration the gender differentials that may exist in the process. Design: A web-based cross-sectional study. Setting: Participants were recruited via social media platform, WhatsApp using google form from March 28 to April 4, 2020. Participants: 1500-Nigerian (mean age =27.43, SD=9.75 with 42.7% females and 57.3% males) were recruited from 180 cities in Nigeria using snowball sampling technique. They responded to an online survey form comprising demographic questions and adapted versions of the Ebola knowledge scale, SARS risk perception scale and a precautionary behavior scale. Result: Moderated mediation analysis showed that risk perception mediated the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior and this indirect effect was moderated by gender. Having correct knowledge of COVID-19 was linked to higher involvement in precautionary behavior through risk perception for females but not for males. COVID-19 awareness campaigns may target raising more awareness of the risks associated with the infection in order to make individuals engage more in precautionary behaviors. Conclusion: Awareness campaigns and psychological intervention strategies may be particularly important at the moment, for males more than females.

This review focuses on relevant scientific information regarding the current knowledge of the yellow head complex viruses, yellow head virus and gill‚Äêassociated virus. The yellow head complex viruses have been problematic within the aquaculture industry for over 10 years and still retain their research topicality. Presently, there are numerous research papers from different journals covering the identification, disease expression and spread, pathogenesis, detection, morphology, genomic sequence and protein profiles of the yellow head complex viruses. Indeed, there has been no extensive review to compare these studies, and as a corollary, to assess flaws in contemporary research and knowledge. Additionally, the yellow head complex viruses rank within the top four prawn viruses with respect to disease impact and economic loss. This review collectively reports on all the findings and current methods of research and aims to identify weak areas of research where conclusions have been unjustifiably drawn and furthermore to elucidate areas that have a gap of knowledge.

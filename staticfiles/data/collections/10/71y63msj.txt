BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers. Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals. However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 × 10(9)/L and 1.04 × 10(9)/L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized. Both conditions require effective prompt actions, especially COVID-19.

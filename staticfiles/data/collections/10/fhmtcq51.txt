Abstract An animal laboratory in a teaching hospital is a possible cause of cross infection. We aimed to assess the infection control in our animal laboratory and evaluate the disinfectant effects of a portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) machine. Samples were taken from the surface of research tables, other high touch places, such as doorknobs, weighing scales, and handles of trolleys, and from air in the barrier system pre- and post-manual cleaning and post-PX-UV disinfection. The bacteria types were identified. We found that routine manual cleaning significantly reduced bacterial colony form unit (CFU)/cm2 (P = .02), and the median of CFU/cm2 reduced from 0.5 pre-cleaning to zero post-cleaning. PX-UV disinfection also significantly reduced residual bacterial counts (P = .002), with the highest counts 10 pre-PX-UV disinfection and 1 afterwards. Without manual cleaning, PX-UV disinfected surfaces significantly (P < .001), median count 6 pre-PX-UV disinfection and zero afterwards. PX-UV significantly reduced bacterial colony counts in the air with the median count falling from 6 to zero (P < .001). Some of the 21 species of pathogens we identified in the current study are pathogenic, resistant to antibiotics, and able to cause nosocomial infections and zoonosis. PX-UV reduced counts of most of the pathogens. PX-UV is an effective agent against these pathogens.

Abstract In the present study, we performed to selectively deplete glycyrrhizin from Si-Ni-San, a traditional Chinese prescription that consists of 4 Chinese herbs including Radix Glycyrrhizae Uralensis, and examined its influence on the suppressing activity of Si-Ni-San against contact sensitivity in mice. An immunoaffinity column was made by covalently coupling the polyclonal antibody, obtained by the immunization with glycyrrhizin–BSA conjugate, to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. By using this column, glycyrrhizin in Si-Ni-San was selectively and almost completely depleted from the whole extract, which was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both 200 mg/kg of Si-Ni-San and 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, the dose corresponding to its proportion contained in Si-Ni-San, significantly reduced the ear swelling of picryl chloride (PCl)-induced ear contact sensitivity in mice and the inhibition by Si-Ni-San was stronger than that by glycyrrhizin. The adhesion activity to type IV collagen of the isolated spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice was significantly decreased by both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin. However, the glycyrrhizin-depleted sample of Si-Ni-San (Si-Ni-SanGL−) only showed a slight inhibition on the cell adhesion. Furthermore, the spleen cells from PCl-sensitized mice produced more matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 than naive spleen cells did, and both Si-Ni-San and glycyrrhizin remarkably reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 production. In contrast, Si-Ni-SanGL− only showed a slight inhibition. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may act as one of the active constituents of Si-Ni-San in inhibiting delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction via down-regulating the MMP production and the cell adhesion to extracellular matrix. The present study also provides a new approach to recognize and validate an active constituent in traditional prescription through a selective depletion.

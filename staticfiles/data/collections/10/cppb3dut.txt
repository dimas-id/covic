PURPOSE The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of incisional ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction following laparoscopic and open colorectal resection. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of a large database comprising 13 hospitals, serving 3.6 million patients in Southern California. Patients 18 years and older undergoing elective colorectal resection over a 3-year period were included. The crude incidence rates were calculated, and relative risks of ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction were determined using multivariable proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred and thirteen patients underwent 4765 colorectal resections between August 2008 and August 2011. Fifty-nine percent of the cases were performed laparoscopically; the median age was 63 years, and 49% were males. Colorectal carcinoma (45%) and diverticulitis (18%) were the most common indications for surgery. The median follow-up was 2.4 years. Kaplan-Meier estimates of ventral hernia at 1, 2, and 3 years among the open cohort were significantly higher at 10.1, 17.0, and 20.5%, compared to 5.7, 8.7, and 10.8% in the laparoscopic cohort (p < 0.001). Similarly, small bowel obstruction was higher in the open compared to the laparoscopic group (open 10.4, 15.0, and 18.3% vs. laparoscopic 2.7, 4.4, and 5.5%, p < 0.001). Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal resection were less likely to develop ventral hernia [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.64 (95% CI 0.52, 0.80); p < 0.0001] and small bowel obstruction [AHR 0.41 (95% CI 0.31, 0.54); p < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of incisional ventral hernia and small bowel obstruction is significantly reduced in patients who undergo laparoscopic compared to open colorectal resection.

PURPOSE The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device (PED Flex) is a new updated version of the PED classic which incorporates a new delivery system to allow facilitation of stent deployment, re-sheathing and removal of the capture coil. This study evaluated the PED Flex in terms of the technical aspects of the procedure and the first-year follow-up results. METHODS This retrospective study involved prospectively collected data from May 2015 to August 2017. The primary endpoint was the technical aspects of the procedure, and the secondary endpoint was the first-year follow-up results. RESULTS Forty-nine patients with 59 target intracranial aneurysms were enrolled. Patients? mean age was 52 years (range, 21 - 71 years), and 31 (63%) were female. All aneurysms except for three were unruptured. The mean aneurysm diameter was 8 mm. Forty-seven patients with 56 aneurysms were successfully treated. Due to advancement, repositioning, and migration problems, 8 (13.1%) stents were not deployed and discharged. The total aneurysm occlusion rate was 77%. The mortality rate was 4.3%. CONCLUSION Our experience shows that the applicability and safety of the renewed delivery system provided by the PED Flex for improving device apposition and opening has been proven with one-year angiographic and clinical follow-up results.

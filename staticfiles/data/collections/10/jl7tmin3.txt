BACKGROUND Little is known about patient satisfaction with single-port access (SPA) surgery for gynaecologic disease related to body image and cosmesis. AIMS This study aimed to determine cosmetic satisfaction with SPA surgery. METHODS Postal questionnaires, including the Body Image Questionnaire, were sent to 159 women who had undergone SPA surgery between May 2008 and April 2010. RESULTS Hundred and forty-six women participated in this study. Most of the women reported a relatively high body image and cosmetic score. The mean scores were 19.6 ± 1.1 and 21.9 ± 2.5, respectively. More than 67% of the women (N = 98) reported that the scar was invisible, and 97.3% of the women said that they would recommend SPA surgery to others. CONCLUSION Single-port access surgery is a good option for the management of gynaecologic disease with respect to patient satisfaction.

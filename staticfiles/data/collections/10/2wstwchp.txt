Coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 emerged in China in December 2019 and then rapidly spread worldwide. Why COVID‐19 patients with the same clinical condition have different outcomes remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the differences in the phenotype and functions of major populations of immune cells between COVID‐19 patients with same severity but different outcomes. Four common type adult inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 from Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not COVID‐19 PCR‐negative conversion occurred within three weeks. Peripheral blood samples were collected to compare the differences in the phenotype and functions of major populations of immune cells between the two groups of patients. The result shows that the proportions of CD3(+)CD8(+)CD38(+)HLA‐DR(+)CD27(‐) effector T killer cells generally declined, whereas that of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(+) double‐positive T cells (DPTs) increased in the persistently PCR‐positive patients. In summary, considering the imbalance between effector T killer cells/ CD3+CD4+CD8+ DPTs was a possible key factor for PCR‐negative conversion in COVID‐19 patients.

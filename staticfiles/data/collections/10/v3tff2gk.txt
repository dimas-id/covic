Four transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) strains (Purdue-115, D-52, 188-SG and Gep-II) and two cell lines (swine testis-ST and pig kidney-RPD) were used to study virus attachment and cell susceptibility. Virus attachment was partially thermodependent and the rate varied, depending on the strain. Identical TGEV inocula produced a higher plaque number by plaque assay in the swine testis cell line (ST) than in the pig kidney cell line (RPD) but [(3)H]uridine-labèlled virus was found associated equally well with both cell lines. A field TGEV strain (Gep-II), which was unable to multiply in cell cultures, appeared able to inhibit the attachment of radiolabelled cell-passaged virus. Therefore, the susceptibility to TGEV infection was apparently not determined at the virus-to-cell attachment stage. The attachment sites on the cell surface were specific, however, differences in TGEV attachment determinant between strains were not observed. Attachment of all the virus strains tested was enhanced by DEAE-dextran and inhibited by dextran sulfate, poly-L-lysine (PLL), poly-L-α-ornithine (PLO) and protamine sulfate.

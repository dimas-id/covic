In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, images of a potential new banknote that may be introduced in Argentina have circulated, which depict Ramón Carrillo (the country's first Minister of Public Health) and Cecilia Grierson (the country's first female physician). In response, the Embassies of world powers such as the United Kingdom and Israel have released statements defaming Ramón Carrillo. The National University of Lanús expresses its support for the public health expert who taught us the importance of training physicians in public health, and that the true problem is not disease at an individual level, but rather that health must be addressed in collective terms.

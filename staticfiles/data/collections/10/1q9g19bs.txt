Avida(1) is a software platform for experiments with self-replicating and evolving computer programs. It provides detailed control over experimental settings and protocols, a large array of measurement tools, and sophisticated methods to analyze and post-process experimental data. This chapter explains the general principles on which Avida is built, its main components and their interactions, and gives an overview of some prior research.

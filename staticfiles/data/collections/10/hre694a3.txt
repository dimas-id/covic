Abstract Background Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly infectious and requires early detection, isolation, and treatment. We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice. Method We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis. Result COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P < 0.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P < 0.05). Conclusion The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19. When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined. Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection. The COVID-19 can cause some hematological indices changes.

This chapter starts the discussion about size effect in physical and other (except electrochemical and mechanical) properties of nanocoatings and its real usage through different examples. It starts from the usage of nanostructured materials in microelectronics and goes through different reported papers in this field. Size effect in nanometric scale has been compared with larger scales by some examples. Detailed discussions about some methods with enough examples were presented in this chapter. Different parts of this chapter include discussions about microelectronics, silicides specifications, size effect in sensing characterization, size effect in optical properties of nanostructured films, self-cleaning glasses, using nanocomposite coating for food packaging and using polarizer nano-layers to produce LCD monitors.

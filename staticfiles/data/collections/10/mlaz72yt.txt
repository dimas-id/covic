During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline healthcare workers (HCW) are working tirelessly for long hours to provide patient care. Although COVID is not dermatotropic, prolonged contact with personal protective equipment (PPE i.e. goggles, face-shield/visor, N 95 respirator, double layered gloves, coverall/gowns, head cover and shoe cover) may cause various dermatoses. Several dermatoses have been reported due to PPE, such as pressure injury, contact dermatitis, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic approach is the gold standard for surgical treatment of morbid obesity. The single-port (SP) approach has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective technique for the treatment of morbid obesity in several case control studies. OBJECTIVES Compare conventional multiport laparoscopy (LAP) with an SP approach for the treatment of morbid obesity using sleeve gastrectomy in terms of postoperative pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) 0-100, surgical outcome, weight loss, and aesthetical satisfaction at 6 months after surgery. SETTING University Hospital, Spain. METHODS Randomized, controlled pilot study. The trial enrolled patients suitable for bariatric surgery, with a body mass index lower than 50 kg/m2 and xiphoumbilical distance lower than 25 cm. Patients were randomly assigned to receive LAP or SP sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS A total of 30 patients were enrolled; 15 were assigned to LAP group and 15 to SP group. No patients were lost during follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. A significantly higher level of pain during movement was noted for the patients in the LAP group on the first (mean VAS 49.3±12.2 versus 34.1±8.9, P = .046) and second days (mean VAS 35.9±10.2 versus 22.1±7.9, P = .044) but not the third day (mean VAS 20.1±5.2 versus 34.12.9 ±4.3, P = .620). No differences regarding pain at rest, operative time, complications, or weight loss at 6 months were observed. Higher aesthetical satisfaction was noticed in SP group. CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, SP surgery presented less postoperative pain in sleeve gastrectomy compared with the conventional laparoscopic approach with similar surgical results.

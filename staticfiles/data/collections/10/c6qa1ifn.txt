INTRODUCTION Cathepsins play an important role in protein degradation and processing. Aberrant cathepsin B or L is closely associated with many serious diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis and autoimmune disorders. Therefore, development of potent and selective cathepsin B and L inhibitors has aroused much attention in recent years. Although several classes of cathepsin inhibitors are presently available, there are still some problems to solve, such as broad-spectrum inhibition to protease, specially cysteine proteases, which lead to unpredictable side effects in clinical trials. Therefore, it is very necessary to discovery new scaffolds and new application of cathepsin B and L inhibitors for developing therapeutic agents for treating diseases mediated by cathepsin B or L. Areas covered: This updated review summarizes new patents on cathepsin B and L inhibitors from 2010 to present. Expert opinion: The review gives the latest development in the area of inhibitors of cathepsin B and L, which have been considered key therapeutic targets for the development of drugs treating related diseases. This review puts emphasis on the discovery of novel small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin B and L, as well as their new application as new therapeutic agents.

Plastic bronchitis is potentially a life-threatening complication of long-standing surgically palliated single ventricle congenital heart disease. Patients can present with hypoxia requiring urgent bronchoscopy for removal of bronchial casts. Perioperative care for these patients is challenging and anesthesia is associated with significant cardiac risk. As more surgically corrected single ventricle patients survive to adulthood, these patients are expected to present more frequently. This report details the perioperative management of 2 Fontan patients with hypoxia and significant plastic bronchitis disease burden.

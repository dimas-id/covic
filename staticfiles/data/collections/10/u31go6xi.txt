The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of cerebrovascular CO(2) reactivity (CO(2) R) in the course and outcome of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Sixty-eight patients with inflammatory CNS diseases and 30 healthy volunteers were included in this prospective observational cohort study. The observational period was between January 2005 and May 2009. The CO(2) R was measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound using the breath-holding method. We compared patients with normal CO(2) R (breath-holding index [BHI(m)] ≥ 1.18 = BHI(N) group) with patients who showed impaired CO(2) R (BHI(m) < 1.18 = BHI(R) group). We also analyzed the association of impaired CO(2) R with the etiology, severity, and outcome of disease. When compared to the BHI(N) group, the patients from the BHI(R) group were older, had a heavier consciousness disturbance, experienced more frequent respiratory failure, and, subsequently, had worse outcomes. There were no fatalities among the 28 patients in the BHI(N) group. The comparison of subjects with bacterial and non-bacterial meningitis revealed no significant differences. The unfavorable outcome of disease (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score 1–3) was significantly more common in subjects with impaired CO(2) R (62.5% vs. 10.7%). Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to establish the prognostic value of BHI(m). The outcome variable was unfavorable outcome (GOS 1–3), while the independent variables were age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and BHI(m). The age and BHI(m) showed the strongest influence on disease outcome. A decrease of BHI(m) for each 0.1 unit increased the risk of unfavorable outcome by 17%. Our study emphasizes the importance of CO(2) R assessment in patients with inflammatory CNS diseases.

Allergic rhinitis is now recognized as a major cause of morbidity that significantly impairs function and quality of life. Moreover, it is now widely held that the pathophysiologic mechanisms causing nasal allergy contribute, or predispose many individuals, to the development of other airway diseases, including asthma. Allergic rhinitis may well be a factor in 24% of children with otitis media with effusion (OME), and perhaps 28% of cases of chronic sinusitis. As many as 78% of persons with asthma aged 15 to 30 years have elevated serum IgE antibodies to five common aeroallergens. In many instances, nasal allergy signals the presence of more severe disease. Considerable evidence now suggests that early and appropriate intervention can improve the quality of life and productivity of patients with allergic rhinitis, enhance the academic performance of children, and reduce the prevalence of airway complications. The goal of treatment has shifted from mere symptom alleviation to blocking the pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause chronic allergic inflammation and leave patients vulnerable to airway infections. The earlier in a patient's life that this can be accomplished, the better the anticipated consequences. A panel of experts was convened in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, on 2 September 1996, to explore these issues and their impact on allergy prevention and treatment in primary care. Their undertaking was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Schering‚ÄêPlough Pharmaceuticals.

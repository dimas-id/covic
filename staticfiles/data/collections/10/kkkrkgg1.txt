Adenoviruses are common pathogens that are responsible for a wide variety of infectious syndromes. The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize members of different adenovirus species at the molecular level and to describe the correlation between viruses and clinical syndromes during a period of 4 years. Between 2002 and 2006, 45 of 512 respiratory specimens (8%) from patients with acute respiratory tract infection tested positive for adenovirus. Four adenovirus isolates from samples sent for enterovirus isolation were also analyzed. This research identified 49 confirmed cases of human adenovirus infection by PCR and/or viral culture. The most common diagnosis was upper respiratory infection (44%). Human adenovirus D was the major species found (59%), followed by Human adenovirus C (36%) and Human adenovirus B (4%). Human adenovirus 5 was the major serotype found producing bronchiolitis, followed by human adenovirus 6. In patients with upper respiratory infection, the major serotype found was human adenovirus 17. Viruses of the species Human adenovirus D were identified in seven (77%) cases of acute febrile syndrome. Four isolates from clinical materials obtained from patients with encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis and meningoencephalitis were identified as belonging to the species Human adenovirus D. Our data demonstrate a surprising result about the identification of an unusual association of viruses of the species Human adenovirus D with different clinical syndromes. This observation could be evaluated as a possible indicator of the emergence of a novel strain but further studies are required.

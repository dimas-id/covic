PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review covers the outpatient management of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), discussing the changing microbiology of CAP since the introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2010, and providing an overview of national guideline recommendations for diagnostic evaluation and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS Rates of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal antibiotic resistance have plummeted since widespread 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunization. Viruses remain the most common cause of CAP in young children; children over age 5 years have increased rates of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A recent national guideline offers recommendations for office-based diagnostic evaluation and treatment of pediatric CAP. SUMMARY This review offers a discussion of the above findings with practical recommendations for the office-based practitioner in the evaluation and treatment of an infant (>3 months) or child with suspected CAP.

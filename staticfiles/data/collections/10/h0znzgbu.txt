OBJECTIVE This article reviews current neuroimaging techniques used for screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of patients with intracranial aneurysms as well as neuroendovascular therapeutic options available to patients. CONCLUSION The diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms have evolved dramatically in the past 20 years. MR angiography and CT angiography allow radiologists to reliably and noninvasively diagnose most intracranial aneurysms. Nonoperative endovascular techniques for treating intracranial aneurysms are now making treatment increasingly safer and more effective.

Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic examinations may be required in COVID-19 patients, resulting in direct contact with the patient and a risk of infection transmission from patients to personnel. Therefore, we recommend to perform problem-oriented, time-limited transthoracic studies. Whenever possible studies should be analyzed off-line outside isolation zones. Transesophageal echocardiography is considered an aerosol-generating procedure and should be performed only in lifesaving indications. Personnel should use appropriate personal protection equipment in the immediate vicinity of the patients, according to the relevant guidelines.

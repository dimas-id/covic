BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopy is an emerging technique that brings new challenges to laparoscopy and introduces new skills that a surgeon must learn. The learning needs for single-incision skills acquisition are unknown and no current guidelines exist for training or for its safe adoption. METHODS We developed an approach to adoption of new surgical techniques and applied it to single-incision laparoscopy. It is based on the following principles: a defined training algorithm, dry and wet-laboratory practice, a graded clinical introduction, and careful review of early outcomes. We analyzed its impact in our initial 40 patients. RESULTS Our training paradigm consisted of the following: attending a formal course, developing a simulation model, and animal laboratory training, followed by graduated clinical adoption. A 20% conversion rate to standard laparoscopy or open surgery occurred. CONCLUSION Introducing a new surgical technique may not only offer potential advantages but also present significant risks. We developed a thoughtful approach to adoption that includes simulation-based training, progressive clinical adoption, and early review of outcomes. This approach may be applied to various new clinical applications.

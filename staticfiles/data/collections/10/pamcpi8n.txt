OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ventilator-related fluctuations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) are associated with cerebral pressure passivity. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective study of newborns undergoing positive-pressure ventilation, we calculated coherence between continuous mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy hemoglobin difference (HbD). Significant HbD–MAP coherence indicated cerebral pressure passivity. CBV changes were measured as the spectral power of total hemoglobin (S(HbT)) at the ventilator frequency. A regression model tested whether S(HbT) predicts cerebral pressure passivity and/or death/brain injury, controlling for birth gestational age and other factors. RESULTS: We studied 68 subjects with prematurity (n = 19), congenital heart disease (n = 11), and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (n = 38). S(HbT), sedative use, and pCO(2) were positively associated, and circulating hemoglobin negatively associated, with cerebral pressure passivity (p < 0.001), which was positively associated with brain injury (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In sick newborns, ventilator-related CBV fluctuations may predispose to cerebral pressure passivity, which may predispose to an adverse neonatal outcome.

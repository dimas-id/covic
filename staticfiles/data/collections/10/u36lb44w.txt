Members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of guanine-nucleotide-binding (G) proteins, including the ARF-like (ARL) proteins and SAR1, regulate membrane traffic and organelle structure by recruiting cargo-sorting coat proteins, modulating membrane lipid composition, and interacting with regulators of other G proteins. New roles of ARF and ARL proteins are emerging, including novel functions at the Golgi complex and in cilia formation. Their function is under tight spatial control, which is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that catalyse GTP exchange and hydrolysis, respectively. Important advances are being gained in our understanding of the functional networks that are formed not only by the GEFs and GAPs themselves but also by the inactive forms of the ARF proteins.

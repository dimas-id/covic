Generally, definitive treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM) presenting with hemorrhage is recommended to prevent recurrent hemorrhage. The risk of craniotomy and resection of BAVM has been well described using the Spetzler-Martin grading scale; however, the optimal timing for the definitive treatment of ruptured BAVM remains unclear. We report an interesting case of spontaneous BAVM thrombosis in which the patient presented with right occipital intracerebral hemorrhage caused by ruptured right occipital micro-BAVM. A preoperative angiogram 4 months later demonstrated spontaneous thrombosis of the AVM. Despite the risk of re-bleeding, the decision to defer treatment in the acute stage of illness in this case was based on the absence of high-risk angioarchitectural features in the arteriovenous malformations (AVM). It is important to emphasize the potential benefits of early conservative management, particularly in patients with low-risk angiographic features. We also review the literature of spontaneous BAVM thrombosis and discuss the potential benefit of early conservative management.

In recent years, the incidence and mortality of infectious diseases in China are increasing. Infectious diseases, especially new infectious diseases, seriously threaten people's lives. Recent works found that most of the emerging infectious diseases come from wild life. At the same time, the impact of human activities on the environment has further deteriorated the living environment of wildlife. However, with the conducted in-depth research on virus, human beings increase the risk of getting infected. Taking Beta Coronavirus as the example, we analyzed the transmission risks of coronavirus in the prevention and control of the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and recommend the prevention and control strategies before, during and after the viral outbreak. Additional works are urgently needed to better define the biological and epidemiological characteristics of these viruses.

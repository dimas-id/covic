Laparoscopic techniques are now well pervading in the treatment of inguinal hernia. This study aims to investigate the laparoscopic strategy for recurrent inguinal hernia repair. Laparoscopic technique was retrospectively applied to 330 patients with 352 recurrent inguinal hernias in the past 14 years. The surgical strategies were further evaluated. There were 22 cases with bilateral recurrent hernias, whereas the rest 308 cases with unilateral disorders. Patients were further categorized by previous repair approaches as high ligation, sclerotherapy, conventional suture repair, Lichtenstein repair, plug and patch repair, and preperitoneal repair. All cases were successfully repaired by laparoscopic approaches including transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) (288 cases), totally extraperitoneal (50 cases), and intraperitoneal onlay mesh (14 cases). The median operation duration was 39.5 ± 13.4 minutes. The average Visual Analog Scales score on postoperative day 1 was 2.4 ± 1.1. The median follow-up time was 36 (14-61) months. There was one case of recurrence during the follow-ups. One severe complication, i.e., bowel injury, was observed and cured, whereas other complications were as follows: 22 seroma, 8 urinary retention, 3 transient paresthesia, and 1 ileus. Laparoscopic procedures for recurrence inguinal hernia are safe and applicable. A surgeon can choose to reinforce the myopectineal orifice or only fix the hernia defect accordingly. The strategy of choosing TAPP and/or totally extraperitoneal depends on the type of previous repair, the exact anatomical position of the previous implanted mesh, and more importantly, the surgeon's experience. Moreover, the intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique can be regarded as a backup option for TAPP in certain cases.

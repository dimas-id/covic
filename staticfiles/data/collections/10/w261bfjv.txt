The study aims to identify health care workers’ risk of COVID-19 and to determine employees’ views on working conditions and the fight against COVID-19 in general, and to present their concerns. The study utilized a survey form developed by researchers as a data collection tool. The research was conducted on 736 health workers in the Turkish population using the online survey method. Descriptive statistical methods, chi-square analysis, and correlation analysis were used in the analysis of the data. The data was carried out in a 95% confidence range. According to the study’s findings, 31.7% of the health care workers involved in the study had contact with 19 cases of COVID-19; 27.3% provided services to patients diagnosed with COVID-19. There is a relationship between the professional groups of health care workers who have been contacted by COVID-19 cases and the professional groups of those who provide services. Among the participants, only 35 people had a diagnostic test, 15 of which were positive for COVID-19 results. Although health care workers find working conditions and authorities to be moderate in tackling COVID-19, their anxiety levels are high. Although health care workers provide services to COVID-19 diagnosed patients, they are not protected against the risk of infection by adequate testing. The risk of transmission threatens more groups of nurses. Considering that COVID-19 is a global threat, measures should be taken to protect health care workers and their families and professional support should be given to address their concerns.

PURPOSE The vascular cannulation is associated with a number of complications. The aim of this work was to study the composition and distribution of the film covering the surfaces of Mahurkar Maxid and Palindrome catheters, which were removed from the body of long-term hemodialysis patients. Moreover, the roughness and contact angle of the catheters were evaluated. METHODS Two brand new (as a reference) and thirty used catheters were the subject of the study. Their implantation period lasted from 4 months to a year and the reason for removal was the production of another vascular access or obstruction. Surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope and goniometer. RESULTS The inner surfaces of the used catheters were covered with a film of various complexity which includes a plurality of protein, blood cell counts and the crystals. The closer to the distal part the film becomes more complex and multi-layered. Even the surfaces of brand new catheter were not completely smooth. The only significant difference between analyzed models was the presence of thrombus in the distal part of Mahurkar Maxid catheters, not in the Palindrome. CONCLUSIONS The distal part of the catheters is the place most exposed to obstruction and infection, which may be due to not reaching the anticoagulant agent into this part. Not only the occurrence of side holes affects the formation of thrombus, but also their quantity, geometry and distribution which effect on fluid mechanics. The surface of the catheters needs to improvement to minimize the occurrence of defects and cracks.

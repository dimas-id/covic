BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis (HD) patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Although all dialysis patients meet government criteria for shielding, only those on home treatment can comply. Patients attending incentre HD units represent a large and vulnerable group, who are unable to rigorously adhere to this advice. The need to adopt strategies to protect these patients is of great importance. We report our experience of delivering dialysis during the COVID-19 outbreak, describing the interventions taken to try to protect patients from virus transmission whilst maintaining optimal treatment. METHODS: We implemented measures, including use of; a system of active triage and isolation of suspected cases, separate transportation, a dedicated COVID-19 HD unit, personal protective equipment, active repatriation of patients back to base units. We collected data from all COVID-19 positive HD patients in our cohort, between 14/03/2020 - 20/04/2020. Data were compared to national reports of other units, and values obtained from a dialysis-specific Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model which predicted the impact of COVID-19 on our cohort. RESULTS: Results showed 76/670 (11.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. The majority were male (61.8%) and from a minority background (61.8%). 7/76 (9.2%) patients died following infection. The model projections overestimated the incidence of COVID-19, 221 vs 76 total number of infections by 20/4/20. Our incidence of COVID-19 and mortality are lower compared to other units across London. CONCLUSION: Implementation of measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, and optimise dialysis, could account for the low infection and mortality rates observed in our cohort of patients.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on inhibiting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus replication, and to lay bases for the future clinical application of siRNA for the treatment of viral infectious diseases. METHODS Vero-E6 cells was transfected with siRNA before SARS virus infection, and the effectiveness of siRNA interference was evaluated by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE) on Vero-E6 cells. RESULTS Five pairs of siRNA showed ability to reduce CPE dose dependently, and two of them had the best effect. CONCLUSION siRNA may be effective in inhibiting SARS-associated coronavirus replication.

The Precision Medicine Era has helped to better manage patients with immunological and oncological disease, improving the quality of life of this class of patients. Regarding the management of these patients and positivity to SARS‐Cov2, currently, limited data is available and information is evolving. In this quick review we have analyzed the mechanisms of action and related infective risk of drugs used for the treatment of immune‐mediated and oncologic skin conditions during the daily clinical practice. In general immunosuppressant and antineoplastic agents for dermatologic treatments do not require suspension and do not require special measures, if not those commonly observed. In the case of a COVID19 patient with complication (such as pneumonia, respiratory failure), treatment suspension should always be considered after taking into account the general condition of the patient, the risk‐benefit ratio and the pathophysiology of COVID19 infection. The COVID19 emergency pandemic does not imply an under‐treatment of existing skin conditions, which together with the SARS‐Cov2 infection may jeopardize the patient's life.

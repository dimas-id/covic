This document, written by the French Association for the Study of the Liver (AFEF) board, aims to provide information to physicians involved in the care of patients with liver disease during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. These are not based on a systematic review of the literature and a rigorous evaluation using the GRADE method. These are recommendations based on feedback from China available in the form of original articles or letters – for which the scientific evidence is often modest – and the rules put forward by American (1) and European (Boettler et al, 2020) hepatology societies, the French National Digestive Cancer Thesaurus (Di Fiore et al., 2020) and the Francophone Transplantation Society (4). These suggestions require adjustment according to the geographical particularities of the epidemic, available standard procedures and access to local resources. This document will be updated as regularly as possible according to the evolution of our knowledge and characteristics on the epidemic.

Two small plaque mutants designated as 1a and 2c were isolated from DBT cells persistently infected with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Unlike the wild type JHM, these two mutant viruses grew more slowly with no prominent cell fusion. The buoyant densities of the mutants were slightly lower and 2c was revealed to have fewer peplomers than JHM by electron microscopy. The purified JHM contained five polypeptides with molecular weights (M.W.) of 260,000, 105,000 (GP105), 65,000, 60,000 (P60), and 23,000 (GP23). In addition to two polypeptides, P60 and GP23, which were common to JHM and the mutants, 1a was found to contain three other specific polypeptides with M.W. of 180,000 (GP160), 110,000, and 95,000 (GP95), while 2c had GP180, GP105, GP95, and one with a M.W. of 175,000. All of these polypeptides were shown to be glycosylated except for P60. After bromelain treatment, all these viruses lost the peplomers and contained P60 and another new 18,000 dalton polypeptide.

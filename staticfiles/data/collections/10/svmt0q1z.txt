BACKGROUND/AIMS Pediatric aneurysms are rare, accounting for 0.5-4.6% of all intracranial aneurysms. Dissecting vertebrobasilar aneurysms (DVBA) are more frequently observed among children than adults. Cases acutely presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage need a prompt treatment because of the higher mortality related to untreated cases. Options for an active DVBA management depend on the features of the malformation and include endovascular and surgical approaches. METHODS We refer to an 8-year-old healthy female, who presented with a sudden severe headache and vomit, followed by a half-hour loss of consciousness. A CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and brain MR angiography showed a lesion with mass effect on bulbar structures, suggestive of an aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar junction. The intracranial angiography confirmed this diagnosis and showed a relevant revascularization coming from the anterior cerebral circulation. RESULTS Endovascular treatment was considered as a suitable option and occlusion of both vertebral arteries, saving the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery, was performed. No neurological deficits appeared after embolization, and the patient was clinically stable at 18 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION In the 'stent era', parent vessel deconstruction throughout endovascular balloon or coil occlusion could be considered in patients with a sound collateral circulation and when cerebellar hemisphere and encephalic trunk feeding is not compromised.

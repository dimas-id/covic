BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Barrel vascular reconstruction device (Barrel VRD) is a novel stent with design features that allow endovascular coiling of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms while preserving adjacent branches, without necessitating dual stent implantation. This study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Barrel VRD at 12-month follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Barrel VRD trial is a prospective, multicenter, observational post-marketing registry evaluating the use of the Barrel VRD for treatment of wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms. The primary effectiveness endpoint was successful aneurysm treatment measured by digital subtraction angiography with a Raymond-Roy occlusion grade of 1 or 2 in the absence of retreatment, parent artery stenosis (>50%), or target aneurysm rupture at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint was the absence of neurological death or major stroke at 12 months. RESULTS Twenty patients were enrolled from December 2013 to December 2014. The device was implanted in 19 patients with 19 aneurysms (8 middle cerebral artery, 4 anterior communicating artery, 1 internal carotid artery terminus, 4 basilar artery aneurysms; mean dome height 5.7±1.91 mm; mean neck length 4.8±1.35 mm, mean dome-to-neck ratio 1.6±2.0). Coiling was performed in all cases. The primary effectiveness endpoint was achieved in 78.9% of subjects (15/19; 12 complete occlusions, 3 neck remnants), and the primary safety endpoint was 5.3% (1/19). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study demonstrates that the Barrel VRD device resulted in ~80% occlusion rates and ~5% rates of neurological complications at 1 year after endovascular treatment of wide-necked bifurcation intracranial aneurysms.

An 18-month-old castrated male ferret (Mustela putorius furo) was presented to the veterinary hospital for acute collapse but died despite initiation of emergency treatment. The body was submitted for a complete postmortem examination. The pathologist determined the ferret was suffering from severe necrotizing encephalitis, necrogranulomatous mediastinal lymphadenitis, and ulcerative dermatitis attributable to systemic Candida parapsilosis. This is the first report of systemic Candida parapsilosis in a ferret.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder that results in aortic root widening and aneurysm if unmanaged. We have previously reported doxycycline, a nonselective matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibitor, to attenuate aortic root widening and improve aortic contractility and elasticity in MFS mice. We were also first to use multiphoton microscopy, a non-invasive and label-free imaging technique, to quantify and link the aortic ultrastructure to possible changes in the skin dermis. Here, we aimed to assess the effects of long-term doxycycline treatment on the aortic ultrastructure and skin dermis of MFS mice through immunohistochemical evaluation and quantification of elastic and collagen content and morphology using multiphoton microscopy. Our results demonstrate a rescue of aortic elastic fiber fragmentation and disorganization accompanied by a decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression within the aortic wall in doxycycline-treated MFS mice. At 12 months of age, reduced skin dermal thickness was observed in both MFS and control mice, but only dermal thinning in MFS mice was rescued by doxycycline treatment. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was reduced in the skin of doxycycline-treated MFS mice. A decrease in dermal thickness was found to be positively associated with increased aortic root elastin disorganization and wall thickness. Our findings confirm the beneficial effects of doxycycline on ultrastructural properties of aortic root as well as on skin elasticity and structural integrity in MFS mice.

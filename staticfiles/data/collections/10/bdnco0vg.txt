Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and up to 15-20% of ischemic strokes can be attributed to atherosclerotic internal carotid artery disease. The treatment of carotid artery disease has been the subject of a wealth of literature in the past twenty years since the publication of the landmark randomized controlled trials, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and the European Carotid Surgery Trial, in the early 1990s. Although these landmark trials have helped establish the current guidelines for treatment of patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, there have since been major advancements in the medical treatment of cardiovascular disease and there still remains a great deal of controversy regarding the timing and technical approach to carotid revascularization. In particular, there has been a wealth of literature to determine whether carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting should be used for revascularization and when this revascularization should occur following onset of symptoms. This update offers an overview of the standards for diagnosis and medical treatment of patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, the indications for surgical revascularization and a review of the most pertinent literature as it pertains to the more controversial issues of technical approach and timing of surgical revascularization following onset of symptoms in patients with carotid artery disease.

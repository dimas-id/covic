The molecular characterization of a strain of Canine minute virus (CnMV) associated with neonatal death is reported. Three newborn puppies of a litter of Jack Russell terrier dogs died after displaying systemic disease, whereas 2 surviving puppies showed no clinical signs with the exception of transient cardiac abnormalities that were evident by electrocardiography. Necropsy of 1 dead puppy revealed severe lesions in the internal organs. A strain of Canine minute virus was detected in tissue samples collected from the puppy, and virus circulation was demonstrated by molecular or serological testing in the dam, puppies of the same litter, and other puppies in the same kennel. By sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the gene encoding for the VP2 capsid protein, the strain circulating in the kennel was found to be related to recent Asian CnMV isolates. Continuous molecular surveillance for CnMV in kennels, shelters, and rescue centers would expand the knowledge base on the epidemiological and pathogenetic features of CnMV, which has been known for several decades but still poorly understood.

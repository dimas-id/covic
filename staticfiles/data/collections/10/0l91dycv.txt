Abstract Messenger RNA was prepared from a hybridoma cell line secreting a monoclonal antibody (53FC3) directed against a luminal epitope of a Golgi membrane protein (Mr = 135 kd) found in rodent cells. When this mRNA was microinjected into the cytoplasm of BHK cells, mouse IgG was seen to accumulate in the Golgi complex after 5â€“6 hr of incubation. No accumulation was seen in 3T3 cells which lack the epitope recognized by 53FC3. When microinjected BHK cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, surface expression of the viral G protein was considerably reduced when compared with neighboring noninjected cells.

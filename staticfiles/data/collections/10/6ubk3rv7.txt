The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic within a few months of onset motivates the development of a rapidly scalable vaccine. Here, we present a self-amplifying RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle as a vaccine and demonstrate induction of robust neutralization of a pseudo-virus, proportional to quantity of specific IgG and of higher quantities than recovered COVID-19 patients. These data provide insight into the vaccine design and evaluation of immunogenicity to enable rapid translation to the clinic.

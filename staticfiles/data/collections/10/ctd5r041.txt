PURPOSE To evaluate the usage of unidirectional barbed suture and its related implications in various surgeon-controlled robotic reconstructive urologic surgeries. METHODS From March 2010 to March 2011, all patients undergoing various surgeon-controlled robotic reconstructive urologic surgeries utilizing barbed sutures were prospectively enrolled in this study. Type and number of procedure performed were noted. Intraoperative and peri-operative outcomes potentially related to suture technique and material were recorded. RESULTS This study reports on 210 patients, in whom barbed suture was used during this period. These included partial nephrectomy (20), pyeloplasty (9), ureteric tailoring and reimplantation (1), closure of bladder after Nephroureterectomy with excision of bladder cuff (8), closure of vaginal cuff in female radical cystectomy (12), partial cystectomy (1), radical prostatectomy (152), simple prostatectomy (2), vesicovaginal fistula repair (3), sacrocolpopexy (1), and hernia repair (1). We encountered 5 instances (2.38%) of tissue cut through possibly attributable to the use of barbed suture and 4 instances of misplacement of suture occurred, of these two required a new suture, whereas retrograde pull back of suture and needle was performed in 2 cases. No instance of slip back/loosening of suture was noted once it was tightened. At mean follow-up of 6.8 (1-14 months) months, we did not encounter any complications of urinary leakage, stone formation or fistula or any clinical evidence of urinary tract obstruction due to the use of barbed suture. CONCLUSION Use of unidirectional barbed suture is safe, feasible, and efficient at short-term follow-up for reconstructive part of urological procedures.

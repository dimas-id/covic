Objectives: To investigate factors associated with the duration of viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha, China were included. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were retrieved. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to explore potential factors. Results: Totally 147 patients with COVID-19 were included. The median duration of viral shedding (the number of days from symptoms onset till the successive negative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA) was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR], 12 to 21). Multivariable Logistic regression analysis indicated that the highest temperature at admission (odds ratio [OR], 5.200; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.190-22.726; p = 0.028) and time from symptom onset to admission (OR, 1.740; 95% CI: 1.296-2.337; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (OR, 1.604; 95% CI: 1.262-2.040; p < 0.001) were risk factors for prolonged duration of viral shedding. Conclusions: This is the study with relatively large sample size that mainly focused on the duration of viral shedding and relevant factors in patients with COVID-19 outside of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors were identified and should be taken into consideration for the strategy of quarantine of infected patients.

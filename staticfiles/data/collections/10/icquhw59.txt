In recent years, alignment-free methods have been widely applied in comparing genome sequences, as these methods compute efficiently and provide desirable phylogenetic analysis results. These methods have been successfully combined with hierarchical clustering methods for finding phylogenetic trees. However, it may not be suitable to apply these alignment-free methods directly to existing statistical classification methods, because an appropriate statistical classification theory for integrating with the alignment-free representation methods is still lacking. In this article, we propose a discriminant analysis method which uses the discrete wavelet packet transform to classify whole genome sequences. The proposed alignment-free representation statistics of features follow a joint normal distribution asymptotically. The data analysis results indicate that the proposed method provides satisfactory classification results in real time.

Most percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices entail thrombolysis and/or thrombus fragmentation followed by subsequent aspiration, with the associated risks of bleeding and embolization. We describe the use of the AngioVac system (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY USA) for extraction of extensive iliocaval thrombus associated with an inferior vena cava filter followed by percutaneous inferior vena cava filter extraction in a patient with an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis. The AngioVac may be considered in this scenario as it does not require thrombolytics and can remove whole thrombus, thus overcoming some of the limitations of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices in the setting of subacute and early chronic thrombus.

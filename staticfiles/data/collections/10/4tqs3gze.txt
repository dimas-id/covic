OBJECTIVE To study thoracic high resolution CT findings of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in convalescent period and the relationship between the features with laboratory and pulmonary function results. METHODS All the 100 SARS patients who had been discharged from hospital for about 2 months underwent thoracic high resolution CT examinations. Among them, 65 also had laboratory results and 91 underwent examinations of pulmonary function. RESULTS Forty-nine SARS patients (49.0%, 49/100) in convalescent period still had abnormal findings in CT examination. And ground-glass opacification (95.9%, 47/49) and reticular opacification (59.2%, 29/49) were common. There was no significant difference in the level of lymphocytes and CD4 cells among groups divided according to severity of CT findings (P > 0.01). Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco%) of level 2 and 3 were statistically lower than that of level 0 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The features of CT findings of SARS patients in convalescent period are not the same as those of patients in period of apparent manifestation. The high resolution CT can reflect pulmonary diffusing function to some degree.

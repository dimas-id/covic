The emergence of COVID-19 as a viral pandemic in early 2020 resulted in notable changes to the daily practice, workflow, and education of orthopaedic residencies internationally. In particular, social distancing, residency restructuring, and redeployment to other services has increased heterogeneity in schedules and made the in-person gathering of trainees for education increasingly challenging. These changes may last until 2024 based on some mathematical models, resulting in notable disruptions to orthopaedic education, especially for junior residents. Therefore, in this study, we describe how we converted our in-person PGY-1 skills course into a "virtual" boot camp based on validated training modules and existing American Board of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines. Lessons learned from the experience and potential areas for improvement in the use of newer technology to teach cognitive knowledge and skills modules are highlighted with the hope that this can be useful to other orthopaedic residency programs, during the pandemic and also beyond.

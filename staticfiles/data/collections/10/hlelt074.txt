Summary Palivizumab is currently licensed for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children with chronic lung disease, with a history of preterm birth, or with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease, but its routine use during outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is not currently recommended. Here we report an outbreak in a NICU detected during a screening trial for RSV infection using a rapid antigen test (Respi-StripÂ®). Eleven preterm infants in our NICU tested positive for RSV during January 2009. Subsequent testing of the remaining infants in the NICU revealed two additional asymptomatic cases. In addition to precautions against cross-infection, palivizumab prophylaxis was administered to the remaining 37 premature infants. Two days after treatment, RSV was detected in two additional infants who had become symptomatic. To our knowledge this is the largest RSV outbreak in a NICU to be identified at an early stage by rapid testing and effectively controlled by infection control measures and palivizumab prophylaxis.

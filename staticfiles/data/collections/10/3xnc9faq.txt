Abstract Acute viral respiratory infections are among the most common causes of human disease. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is important for providing timely therapeutic interventions. This study evaluated a new multiplex PCR assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) for simultaneous detection and identification of 12 respiratory viruses using two primer mixes. The viruses included parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, and human rhinovirus A. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 10â€“100 copies per reaction for each type of virus. There was no cross-reactivity with common bacterial or viral pathogens. A comparison with conventional viral culture and immunofluorescence was carried out using 101 respiratory specimens from 92 patients. Using viral culture, 57 specimens (56.4%) were positive without co-infection. The same viruses were identified in all 57 specimens using the multiplex PCR. Seven of the 57 specimens (12.3%) were found to be co-infected with other respiratory viruses, and 19 of 44 (43.2%) specimens which were negative by culture were positive by the multiplex PCR. The Seeplex Respiratory Virus Detection assay represents a significant improvement over the conventional methods for the detection of a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses.

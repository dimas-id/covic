During the recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, there is rising concerns about neurological complications of COVID-19. Fever, headache and anosmia may occur early during the disease course. Other neurological sequalae such as encephalitis may occur in later phases. We report a case of acute myelitis in a 32 year old male Covid-19 positive patient who presented with a two-day history of flu-like symptoms then sudden onset paraplegia and urinary retention. The incidence is not known and the pathogenesis of the disease behind this manifestation is still not fully understood. Nevertheless considering the broad differential diagnosis of acute myelitis, prompt clinical and diagnostic work up was crucial to exclude other causes. Patients presenting with neurological symptoms such as loss of consciousness, ataxia, convulsions, status epilepticus, encephalitis, myelitis or neuritis should raise concerns for Covid-19 infection during this pandemic prompting early diagnosis and initiation of proper management.

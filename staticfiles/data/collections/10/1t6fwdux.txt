BACKGROUND Single anastomosis gastric bypass (SAGB) has been established as a safe and effective bariatric procedure. SAGB has also been suggested as a conversion option from other procedures, but so far not extensively explored in that direction. METHODS The study retrospectively reviewed and analyzed 154 consecutive SAGB procedures, including 48 conversional SAGB (cSAGB) and 106 primary SAGB (pSAGB). Preoperative physical dimensions and perioperative complications were obtained. Patients were followed 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, with weight measurements compared between groups. RESULTS Operative times were longer in the cSAGB group but length of hospital stay was the same for both groups. Sixty-five percent of the cSAGB group had adjustable banding as a primary operation, and 94 % opted for conversion due to insufficient weight loss or regain thereof. Follow-up data availability was 98, 82, and 79 % for the three checkpoints. Three and 6 months postoperatively, cSAGB had inferior mean excess weight loss (EWL) compared to pSAGB, though both groups were successful after 6 months (mean EWL >50 %). Body mass index loss was significantly higher for pSAGB for the first postoperative 3 months. Low complication rates in both groups precluded statistical comparison in that respect. DISCUSSION Initial weight loss after conversional SAGB is inferior to primary SAGB after 6 months. The observed safety of cSAGB is comparable to previous evidence for this procedure in the conversional settings. CONCLUSION SAGB may be considered as a safe and effective conversional procedure, but not as effective as pSAGB for initial weight loss.

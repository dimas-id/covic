Twenty-one cats presented with a history of slowly progressive neurological signs characterised by a stiff extended tail, behavioural changes, and spastic and ataxic gait. All cats had outdoor access and lived in the same geographical rural area in north-east Scotland. Histological findings were consistent with lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis. Immunohistochemistry ruled out 15 pathogens and showed a significant expression of the interferon-inducible Mx protein, suggesting an as yet unidentified infective or environmental immunogenic trigger as the possible causative agent. The late age at onset (mean 9 years), the very slow progression of clinical signs (mean 11 months) and the peculiar clinical presentation (particularly the posture of the tail) have not been reported previously in cats with lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis.

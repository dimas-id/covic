BACKGROUND AND AIMS 3D high-resolution anorectal manometry (3D HRAM) provides a 3D topographic image of pressure along the anal canal. The aim of the study was to determine normal values of 3D HRAM in children. METHODS Children without any symptoms arising from the lower gastrointestinal tract were prospectively enrolled in the study. Manometry procedures were performed using a rigid probe (Covidien/Medtronic, Ireland) without premedication. Pressure within the anal canal and 3D images of sphincters were measured. If possible, defecation dynamics and thresholds of sensation were evaluated. Data were expressed as the mean (±SD). RESULTS A total of 61 children (34 males; age: 2-17 years, mean: 8.28 years) were studied. The mean resting and squeeze sphincter pressures were 83.43 (±23.23) mmHg and 191 (±64.21) mmHg, respectively. The mean length of the anal canal was 2.62 (±0.68) cm and correlated with age (r = 0.49, p < 0.0001). The mean rectal balloon volume to elicit recto-anal inhibitory reflex was 15.66 (±10.9) cc. The first sensation, urge and discomfort were observed at 24.42 (±23.98) cc, 45.91 (±34.55) cc and 91.58 (±50.17) cc of the balloon volume, respectively. The mean resting pressure of the puborectalis muscle was 71.54 (±14.58) mmHg while the mean squeeze pressure was 134.10 (±35.2) mmHg. A positive correlation between age and balloon volume needed to elicit discomfort was determined (r = 0.49, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Normative data of 3D HRAM in children without symptoms arising from the lower gastrointestinal tract were established. There were no significant differences in pressure results between males and females.

We designed specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and synthesized oligo fragments, then siRNA was obtained by in vitro transcription and transfected into cultured human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29 with lipofectamine. We also analyzed the effect of the siRNA on proliferation of HT-29 cells by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and expression level of VEGF mRNA of transfected cells by RT-PCR as well as amounts of secreted VEGF protein in the supernatant by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two groups of siRNA targeting human VEGF effectively inhibited proliferation of HT-29 cells after transfection. The secretion of VEGF protein also notably decreased, but the control scramble siRNA showed no effect.

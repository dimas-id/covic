The significance of electricity for medicine in the modern industrial age should not be underestimated. Particularly in connection with neurasthenia, electrotherapeutic approaches also experienced a boom for domestic use. Thus, electrotherapy reached urology just as it was becoming established as a medical specialty. We analyzed urological manuals and textbooks and objects in the W. P. Didusch Center for Urologic History and the Museum zur Geschichte der Urologie in Berlin to present the wide range of indications for electrotherapy in the emerging field of urology from impotence to urethral strictures and try to highlight the variability of their importance over time.

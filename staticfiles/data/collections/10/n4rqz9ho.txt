INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and has become a global threat Comparison of hematological parameters between mild and severe cases of SARS-CoV 2 is so far limited, but significant differences in parameters such as interleukin-6, d-dimers, glucose, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein have been already reported PURPOSE: In this study we analyzed the changes observed in easily measured blood biomarkers in the patients and provided evidence of how these markers can be used as prognostic factors of the disease METHODS: Demographic characteristics, detailed medical history, and laboratory findings of all enrolled SARS-CoV 2 infection positive patients who were referred to Patras University Hospital from the period of March 4th 2020 (when first confirmed case in Greece appeared in our hospital) until April 4th 2020 were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed RESULTS: We provided evidence that some very common laboratory values can be used as independent predictive factors in SARS-CoV 2 infection Despite the retrospective nature of this study and the small number of subjects analyzed, we showed that NLR, LDH, d-dimers, CRP, fibrinogen and ferritin can be used early at the patient's first visit for SARS-CoV 2 infection symptoms and can predict the severity of infection CONCLUSION: More studies are warranted to further objectively confirm the clinical value of prognostic factors related to SARS-CoV 2 and establish an easy-to-get panel of laboratory findings for evaluating the disease severity

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a health emergency worldwide, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are increasingly reported in COVID‐19 patients. However, sample size was small and the incidence of GI symptoms in patients was variable across studies, and the correlation between these symptoms and clinical outcomes remains incompletely understood. The objective of this study is to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without GI symptoms admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan. METHODS: All patients admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital were evaluated. Data on epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment procedures, and clinical outcomes were retrieved from electronic medical records. RESULTS: This retrospective study recruited 1320 COVID‐19 patients admitted to hospital from February 5, 2020, to March 9, 2020. On the basis of the presence of GI symptoms, the sample was divided into a GI group (n=192) and a non‐GI group (n=1128). The most common GI symptoms were diarrhea (8.1%), anorexia (4.7%), and nausea and vomiting (4.3%). The risk of clinical deterioration was significantly higher in the GI group than in the non‐GI group (15.6% vs. 10.1%, p=0.032). GI symptoms (p=0.045), male gender (p<0.001), and increased C‐reactive protein (p=0.008) were independent risk factors for clinical worsening. CONCLUSION: The risk of clinical deterioration was significantly higher in the GI group. Furthermore, potential risk factors for developing GI symptoms, male gender, and increased C‐reactive protein can help clinicians predict clinical outcomes in COVID‐19 patients.

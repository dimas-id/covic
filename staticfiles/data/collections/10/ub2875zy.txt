Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an emerging arthropod-borne pathogen, has a broad host and cell tropism. Here we report that the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate, abundantly present on the surface of most animal cells, is required for efficient entry of RVFV. Entry was significantly reduced by preincubating the virus inoculum with highly sulfated heparin, by enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate from cells and in cells genetically deficient in heparan sulfate synthesis.

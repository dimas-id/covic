Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now widely spread globally. The main transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 comprise human-to-human droplet infection, including inhalation and contact infection of patientâ€™s saliva, blood and other body fluids through oral mucosa, nasal mucosa, and the eyes, and orofecal transmission. Dental treatment necessitates close-proximity, face-to-face practices and can generate droplets or aerosols containing water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris during the procedure. Therefore, dental professionals are at a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 spread during dental procedures, Taipei City Hospital established a dental patient triage and workflow algorithm for the provision of dental services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to institute an appropriate standard procedural policy for patient management and recommendation of dental treatment at hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

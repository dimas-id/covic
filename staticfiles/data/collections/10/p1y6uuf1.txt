Why do some countries more effectively respond to crises than others? This paper compares China’s relatively effective response to the 2002–3 SARS outbreak with Taiwan’s relatively ineffective response, focusing on three variables that constitute China’s ‘authoritarian advantage’ - centralized decision making powers; public support; and, relations with the mass media. The paper rejects a fourth explanatory variable specific to the Taiwan case – membership in international organizations. Drawing heavily on the Taiwan example, the paper concludes by suggesting options for overcoming the authoritarian advantage in pandemic response.

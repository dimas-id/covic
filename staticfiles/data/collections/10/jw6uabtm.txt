In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been concern regarding the use of ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents by COVID-19 infected patients. Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) are structurally similar and have anti-inflammatory functions that resemble those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Since 5-ASAs are a mainstay treatment for inflammatory bowel disease, the authors review the pharmacology of both classes of drugs and discuss the potential relevance of 5-ASAs in the ongoing discussion of medication use in patients infected with COVID-19.

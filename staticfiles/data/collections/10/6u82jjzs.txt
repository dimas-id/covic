Using ovalbumin as a model protein in pure solution it was found that affinity chromatography of antisera against either native ovalbumin (NOA) or heat‐denatured ovalbumin (HDOA) gave four different antibody populations AC(1 4) from each antiserum, with different binding properties to the related or unrelated antigen. Direct ELISA was shown to be useless for differentiating NOA from HDOA. Immunoprecipitation in solution is time consuming and, moreover, whereas NAC(1) was shown to be specific for NOA compared with HDOA, DAC(1), NAC(2) and DAC(2) were shown not to be fully specific for HDOA. In contrast, by using as capture antibodies either NAC(3) or DAC(4), a sandwich ELISA can be designed which is fully specific for NOA or HDOA, respectively. An approach to the identification of the temperature at which ovalbumin has been heated is described. This test will show whether ovalbumin has been heated to lower than 65°C or higher than 85°C. The test was applied to juices from canned mushrooms containing 2% ovalbumin.

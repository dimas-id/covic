Patients presenting with acutely symptomatic carotid stenosis (a "hot carotid") are known to be at a high up-front risk of recurrent strokes. Uncertainties remain regarding the appropriate management of such patients in the acute period, particularly with respect to anti-thrombotic treatment as they await revascularisation with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or angioplasty/stenting (CAS). Decision-making is further complicated when intraluminal thrombi are encountered on vessel imaging. Given these uncertainties, and the paucity of high-quality data in the literature, we sought expert opinion from around the globe on how to manage patients with a "hot carotid" as they await CEA/CAS, with a focus on anti-thrombotic treatment options. Similar questions were posed to the rest of our readership in an online survey, the results of which are also presented.

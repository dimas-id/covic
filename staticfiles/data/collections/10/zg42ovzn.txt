We were deeply saddened to learn that Kathryn Howell passed away on April 10, another casualty of the ongoing battle against SARS-CoV2. Throughout her career, she was a vibrant and enjoyable spirit, who was passionate about science and unfailingly kind and generous to all who were privileged to know her as a colleague and a friend.

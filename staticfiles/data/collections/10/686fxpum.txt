Viruses are intracellular parasites that use the host cell they infect to produce new infectious progeny. Distinct steps of the virus life cycle occur in association with the cytoskeleton or cytoplasmic membranes, which are often modified during infection. Plus-stranded RNA viruses induce membrane proliferations that support the replication of their genomes. Similarly, cytoplasmic replication of some DNA viruses occurs in association with modified cellular membranes. We describe how viruses modify intracellular membranes, highlight similarities between the structures that are induced by viruses of different families and discuss how these structures could be formed.

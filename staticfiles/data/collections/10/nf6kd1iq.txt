With biochemistry forced to transition to remote-teaching online, the cooperative active learning and problem-solving normally in labs have been limited. With little ability to perform experiments with laboratory equipment, determining how to mimic the qualities integral to these labs in an online environment is necessary. We propose one possible solution to provide online labs: short case-based learning activities.

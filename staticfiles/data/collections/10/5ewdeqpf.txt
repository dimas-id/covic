The proteins' ubiquitination and their further degradation by proteasomes are crucial for cell cycle regulation, transcription and DNA replication, inflammatory response, and apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitors have recently become considered as a promising method in cancer and inflammatory disease therapy. In this study, utilizing the rat model, we try to establish the influence of proteasome inhibitor MG-132: (1) on the basis of spontaneous and evoked locomotor activity and (2) on the condition of nigrostriatal projections eight weeks after MG-132 intraperitoneal administration. We also discuss the current status of knowledge about intraperitoneal administration of MG-132, a laboratory method that is being used more and more. Our results revealed a lack of motor abnormalities, but significant loss (20%) of substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons after systemic MG-132 administration. This loss was accompanied by a corresponding decrease (8%) of density of dopaminergic terminals in dorsolateral striatum. Moreover, evidence of very limited but ongoing fibre degeneration within the dorsal striatum suggests that MG-132 severely disturbed the nigrostriatal pathway. In summary, intraperitoneal application of proteasome inhibitor MG-132, despite the encouraging results of experimental treatment and prevention of many pathological processes, should be used with caution because of the potential adverse effects on the structure of the central nervous system, especially elements of the nigrostriatal pathway.

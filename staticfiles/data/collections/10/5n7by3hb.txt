L-type lectins possess a luminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that binds to high-mannose-type oligosaccharides in aCa(2+)-dependent manner. The L-type CRD is named after the lectins found in abundance in the seeds of leguminous plants, such as concanavalin A from jack beans. The history of L-type lectins is as old as discovery of plant lectins from seeds of leguminous plants in nineteenth century. The structural motifs of L-type lectins are now known to be present in a variety of glycan-binding proteins from other eukaryotic organisms. The domain is present in plant, fungal, and animal proteins, but plant and animal L-type lectins have divergent sequences and different molecular properties. While plant lectins are secreted-soluble proteins and found at high level in specialised tissues, animal L-type lectins are (often membrane-bound) luminal proteins that are found at low levels in many different cell types. This observation suggests that animal L-type lectins have different functions. The crystal structures of some of the legume seed lectins show structural similarities among these lectins and to some other lectins, including the galectins and a variety of other lectins. Therefore, the term “L-lectins” has been designated as a classification for all lectins with this legume seed lectin-like structure. The L-type lectin-like domain has an overall globular shape composed of a β-sandwich of two major twisted antiparallel β-sheets. The β-sandwich comprises a major concave β-sheet and a minor convex β-sheet, in a variation of the jelly roll fold (Velloso et al. 2002, 2003; Satoh et al. 2006, 2007).

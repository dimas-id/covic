Indigenous marine virus strains outnumber any form of life in the sea, usually occurring in billion amounts per liter (Danovaro et al., 2001; Fuhrman, 1999). However, although transspecific propagation of viruses may take place, the virusâ€”host relationship tends to be quite constrained, and consequently human viruses are the only viral agents of public health concern in the marine environment.

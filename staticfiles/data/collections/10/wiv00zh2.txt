INTRODUCTION Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies are enhancing studies of viral pathogenesis. Identification and quantification of host and viral proteins and modifications in cells and extracellular fluids during infection provides useful information about pathogenesis, and will be critical for directing clinical interventions and diagnostics. AREAS COVERED Herein we review and discuss a broad range of global proteomic studies conducted during viral infection, including those of cellular responses, protein modifications, virion packaging, and serum proteomics. We focus on viruses that impact human health and focus on experimental designs that reveal disease processes and surrogate markers. Expert commentary: Global proteomics is an important component of systems-level studies that aim to define how the interaction of humans and viruses leads to disease. Viral-community resource centers and strategies from other fields (e.g., cancer) will facilitate data sharing and platform-integration for systems-level analyses, and should provide recommended standards and assays for experimental designs and validation.

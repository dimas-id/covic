Recent advances in proteomics have been combined with traditional methods for isolation of nucleoli from mammalian and plant cells. This approach has confirmed the growing body of data showing a wide role for the nucleolus in eukaryotic cell biology beyond ribosome generation into many areas of cell function from regulation of the cell cycle, modulation of the cell stress response to innate immune responses. This has been reflected in the growing body of evidence that viruses specifically target the nucleolus by sequestering cellular nucleolar proteins or by targeting viral proteins to the nucleolus in order to maximise viral replication. This review covers those key areas and looks at the latest approaches using high‚Äêthroughput quantitative proteomics of the nucleolus in virus infected cells to gain an insight into the role of this fascinating compartment in viral infection.

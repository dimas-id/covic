Neurological dysfunction is an uncommon complication following extrahepatic portosystemic shunt ligation. Three dogs and one cat are described that developed neurological signs within 21 to 42 hours of attenuation of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. None of these cases had biochemical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy postoperatively. Two dogs died during management of status epilepticus following aspiration of food. One dog died six months postoperatively. The cat had persistent neurological dysfunction at discharge, but was alive and had recovered most of its neurological function at the time of writing, 37 months after surgery. This report demonstrates the potential for animals with intrahepatic portosystemic shunts to develop postoperative neurological signs and highlights the difficulty of managing such cases. Two dogs had both intrahepatic and extrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Large intestinal malrotation (partial situs inversus) may have been linked to the development of a portosystemic shunt in the remaining dog.

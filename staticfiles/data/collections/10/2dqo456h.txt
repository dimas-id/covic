BACKGROUND: Porcine astroviruses (PAstVs) are common in pigs worldwide. There are five distinct lineages with each lineage representing a different ancestral origin. Recently, multiple reports have demonstrated the evidence of extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs, but little is known about viremia. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 532 fecal samples and 120 serum samples from healthy pigs were collected and tested from 2013 to 2015 in Guangxi province, China; of these 300/532 (56.4%) and 7/120 (5.8%) of fecal samples tested positive for PAstVs, respectively. Our study revealed that there was wide genetic diversity and high prevalence of the virus in the pig population. All five of the known PAstVs genotypes (1â€“5) prevailed in the pig population of Guangxi province and were distributed in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to sows, with PAstV2 (47.7%), PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%) seen predominantly. Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1b and partial capsid sequences from fecal and serum samples revealed that they were divided into the five lineages. Among these genotypes, based on partial ORF2 genes sequencing 23 strains were grouped as PAstV1, including 6 serum-derived strains, and were regarded as the causative agents of viremia in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the information regarding the types of PAstV in blood is limit. This is the first report for the presence of PAstV1 in blood and PAstV3 in the feces of nursery pigs of China. This study provides a reference for understanding the prevalence and genetic evolution of PAstVs in pigs in Guangxi province, China. It also provides a new perspective for understanding of the extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs in pigs.

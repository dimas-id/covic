While the potential therapeutic utility of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is well established, the clinical development of ACE2 drugs has been limited, likely due in part to the short half-life of the protein. In contrast, Ig-like ACE2 fusion proteins have exhibited greatly extended plasma half-life in vivo, and they have been shown to have a potent neutralization effect against SARS-CoV-2. Clinical investigation of Ig-like ACE2 fusion proteins as COVID-19 interventions is thus warranted.

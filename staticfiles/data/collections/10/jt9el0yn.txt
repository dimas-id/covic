OBJECTIVE To determine the technical feasibility and clinical outcomes of laparoscopic anterior resection using combined single-port and endoluminal technique. METHODS A single port was placed at the umbilicus. Sigmoid colon was retracted using transabdominal sutures. After adequate mobilization, the colon was stapled distal to the lesion using noncutting endostapler, and the rectum was opened distal to the staple line. The transanal endoscopic operation device was placed transanally and the anvil of a circular stapler was then delivered through the device into the peritoneal cavity. The anvil was placed intraluminally through a colotomy made proximal to the lesion; after this, the colon was transected above the colotomy site. The specimen was next delivered transanally through the transanal endoscopic operation device. Finally, the rectum was closed with endostapler and intracorporeal side-to-end colorectal anastomosis was constructed using the circular stapler. RESULTS This technique was attempted in an 80-year-old woman with a 3 cm sessile polyp in the distal sigmoid. Laparoscopic anterior resection was arranged as the polyp was not amenable to endoscopic removal. The operative time was 150 minutes. There was no intraoperative complication. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 6, with a maximum pain score of 3. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic anterior resection using this combined single-port and endoluminal technique is feasible for small lesions in the sigmoid colon or upper rectum. The technique avoids multiple trocar incisions and a minilaparotomy for specimen retrieval.

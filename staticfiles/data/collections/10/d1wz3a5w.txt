The entrapment, fracture, and dislodgement of catheterization devices during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are rare complications, for which cardiac surgery is sometimes required. Here, we encountered a rare but instructive case of balloon catheter fracture during PCI. Although there have been some reports of guidewire fracture in PCI, reports on balloon catheter fracture are very rare to our knowledge. A simulation test to examine the mechanism of balloon catheter fracture revealed that overuse of the balloon catheter, both for kissing balloon inflation and balloon anchor, was highly likely to have been the cause of the fracture.

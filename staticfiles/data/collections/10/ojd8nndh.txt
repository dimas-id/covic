Inside-out nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a unique technique for investigating large in-situ objects outside of tools, to provide pore structure and pore-bearing fluids properties. However, in borehole, objects towards azimuthal orientations pose different properties, referred to as azimuthal spatial heterogeneity. This may lead to ambiguous evaluations by utilizing present inside-out NMR measurement, which hardly resolves azimuthal information and loses the location information of oil/gas. In this paper, we for the first time design and construct an innovative tool to investigate the heterogeneity of large in-situ samples. The most key component, array coil, which performs with azimuthal selection, measurement consistency and interactive isolation, configured in this novel tool to capture heterogeneity information. Whereas, strong coupling between neighboring coil elements largely decrease the coil sensitivity. Capacitive decoupling network is bridged into adjacent ports without segmenting coils to be decoupled and could be easily adjusted by electrical relays. The coil model and numerical simulation are firstly given to demonstrate the array coil configuration, B1 field map and mutual coupling effects on coil sensitivity. Capacitive network is then introduced to be theoretically and practically analyzed to minimize coupling effects. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that these coil elements have excellent consistency and independence to feasibly acquire the azimuthal NMR data.

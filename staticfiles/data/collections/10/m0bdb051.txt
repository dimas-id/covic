BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumours of the digestive tract. The most frequent site of occurrence is the stomach. Due to the high potential for malignancy of GIST, resection should be the first-line treatment. Minimally invasive surgery may be used for surgical resection of GISTs. METHODS We describe a case of laparoscopic and robotic distal gastrectomy in a patient with diagnosis of GIST in the gastric antrum. Laparoscopy was useful for dissection and a da Vinci robot was used for Roux-en-Y reconstruction. RESULTS The postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive surgery offers benefits compared to open surgery, and laparoscopic and robot-assisted gastrectomy for the treatment of GIST could be technically feasible and safe because of the advantageous movements provided by the robotic arms.

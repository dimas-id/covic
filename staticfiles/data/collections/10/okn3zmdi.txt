Human metapneumovirus was detected in 15 of 123 children (12%) younger than 3 years of age hospitalized for treatment of acute respiratory infection between July and November 2004. The virus was detected by RT-PCR directly from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or from supernatants after cell culture. Children infected with hMPV were mostly younger than one year of age (67%), all presenting with fever and cough. The main cause for hospitalization was the need for oxygen therapy (73%). Four hMPV positive children had an identifiable co-morbid condition but had a similar clinical evolution when compared to previously healthy infants. Chest radiography showed an increase in interstitial infiltrates with focal consolidation in 6 children. Obstructive bronchial syndrome and bronchiolitis, with or without pneumonia, were the most frequent diagnosis associated with hMPV positivity. A rapid and sensitive diagnostic method is required to improve diagnosis and treatment of these patients.

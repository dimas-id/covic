RATIONALE Obtaining venous access in a patient with extensive postburn scar contractures is a challenge. PATIENT CONCERNS A 39-year-old woman suffered a burn 2 years previously with a total body surface area burn of 93%, and a burn index of 85. Reconstructive surgery was previously performed 39 times. Split-thickness skin grafting to the neck was planned. She had no accessible peripheral veins. DIAGNOSIS Difficult venous access due to excessive burn scar contractures. INTERVENTIONS Central venous catheterization was considered impossible even with ultrasound guidance. We placed a midline catheter for intraoperative venous access in a patient with extensive burn scar contractures. The midline catheter is a peripheral venous catheter placed in an arm vein. OUTCOMES We successfully placed a midline catheter in the right brachial vein. This catheter was used for 24 days without difficulty. LESSONS The midline catheter is a viable choice in patients with difficult vascular access due to extensive postburn scar contractures.

Abstract New examples of high-level ribosomal frameshift and readthrough events have been described over the past year and a half. These include âˆ’1 frameshifiting at tandem codons and + 1 frameshifiting at neighboring slow codons. Several bizarre examples of ribosome jumping and multiple stop-codon readthrough continue to perplex investigators in this field.

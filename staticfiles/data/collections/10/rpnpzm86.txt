Herein, we report that a recombinant fusion protein, containing a 457 amino acid SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD, residues 319-541) and a mouse IgG1 Fc domain, could induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and stimulate humoral and cellular immunity in mice. The antibodies also effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to soluble ACE2, indicating that RBD-mFc may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

BACKGROUND Even in a large volume bariatric centre, bariatric surgeons are sometimes confronted with intraoperative anatomical challenges which force even the most experienced surgeon into a pioneering position. In this video we present how a large gap of approximately 8 cm is bridged by applying several techniques that are not part of our standardized surgical procedure. CASE PRESENTATION After creation of a 20 mL gastric pouch we discovered that the alimentary limb could not be advanced further cranially due to a very short a thick jejunal mesentery in a 49 year old male patient during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery. By dissecting the gastro-oesophageal junction form the crus, stretching the gastric pouch, transecting the jejunal mesentery, using a retrocolic/retrogastric route, and creating a fully hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy we were able to safely complete the LRYGB. Drains were left near the gastrojejunostomy and the patient was kept nil by mouth for 5 days. On the 5th postoperative day radiographic swallow series were obtained which revealed no sign of leakage. The patient was discharged in good clinical condition on the 6th postoperative day. To date, no complications have occurred. Weight loss results are -31.5 % of the preoperative total body weight. CONCLUSIONS When confronted with a large distance between the gastric pouch and the alimentary limb, several techniques presented in this video may be of aid to the bariatric surgeon. We stress that only experienced bariatric surgeon should embark on these techniques. Inspecting the alimentary limb before the creation of the gastric pouch may prevent the need for such complex techniques.

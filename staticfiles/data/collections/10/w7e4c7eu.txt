Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery has gained increased acceptance among surgeons in various specialties. The universal nature of port placement in the umbilicus during LESS surgery may enable concomitant procedures to be performed in these surgical specialties via this single incision. This case report presents a 37-year-old woman who underwent concomitant LESS cholecystectomy and hysterectomy to treat a symptomatic fibroid uterus and symptoms of cholelithiasis. The surgical procedure was performed in approximately 3 hours without any complications, and the patient was discharge to home 18 hours after the procedure. This case demonstrates that increasingly complex concomitant procedures can be performed using a LESS surgical approach.

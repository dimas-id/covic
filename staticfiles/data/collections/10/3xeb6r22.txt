METHODS: A telephone survey was administered to a random sample of adults (n=1650) living in the L6L and L6K Forward Sortation Areas of Oakville, Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: While close to 100% of survey respondents were aware of WNv and approximately 80% recalled receiving information from the public health department regarding the virus, levels of reported personal protective behaviours were relatively low. Through a multivariable modeling process, a range of determinants emerged to explain outcome levels. DISCUSSION: The message about public education in the face of emerging health threats is clear; that is, that public education is key. But we cannot end the public health presence there - public health researchers must evaluate the uptake of the message.

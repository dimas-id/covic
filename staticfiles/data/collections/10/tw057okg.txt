Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has raised global public health concerns. The recent outbreak of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection has led to 1 338 laboratory-confirmed cases in 26 countries worldwide as reported till 19 June, 2015. MERS-CoV may be considered a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barrier to humans, but the pathogenesis and the routes of transmission are not completely understood. Most MERS-CoV cases reported thus far have a history of residence in or travel to the Middle East. Human-to-human transmission though was observed on some occasions in Korea, it is documented as non-sustainable event. The envelope spike glycoprotein on the surface of MERS-CoV which mediates receptor binding, membrane fusion and viral entry is thought to be involved in the mechanism of MERS-CoV.No specific and effective treatment for MERS-CoV is currently recommended, although supportive treatment has played an important role. Prophylactic strategies are necessary to prevent MERS-CoV infection.

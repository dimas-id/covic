OBJECTIVE In order to understand the epidemiological and virologic characteristics of coronavirus HKU1 infection in hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in Changsha. METHODS 1165 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) specimens were collected from hospitalized children with ARTI between September 2007 and August 2008 in Changsha. Specimens were screened for pol gene of coronavirus HKU1 by polymerase chain reaction. All positive amplification products were confirmed by sequencing and compared with those in GenBank. RESULTS Coronavirus HKU1 were detected in 12 patients (1.03%) out of the 1165 children. The patients were from 8 days to 3 years. The most common clinical diagnosis was bronchopneumonia(83.33%). Similarity of coronavirus HKU1 with those published in the GenBank at nucleotide levels was 98.18% - 100%. CONCLUSION Coronavirus HKU1 may be important pathogens in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection. Coronavirus HKU1 infections are common in children under 3 years old. There is no significant difference in the infectious rate between the boys and the girls. The peak of its prevalence is in spring and winter. A single genetic lineage of Coronavirus HKU1 was revealed in human subjects in Changsha.

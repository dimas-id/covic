Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belongs to the beta coronavirus subfamily and causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans especially when infected patients have underlying diseases such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Previously, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV-encoded ORF8b strongly inhibits MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of the interferon beta (IFN-Î²) promoter activities. Here, we report that ORF8b seem to regulate MDA5 or RIG-I differentially as protein levels of MDA5 were significantly down-regulated while those of RIG-I were largely unperturbed. In addition, ORF8b seemed to efficiently suppress phosphorylation of IRF3 at the residues of 386 and 396 in cells transfected with RIG-I while total endogenous levels of IRF3 remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, ORF8b was able to inhibit all forms of RIG-I; full-length, RIG-I-1-734, and RIG-I-1-228, last of which contains only the CARD domains. Taken together, it is tempting to postulate that ORF8b may interfere with the CARD-CARD interactions between RIG-I and MAVS. Further detailed analysis is required to delineate the mechanisms of how ORF8b inhibits the MDA5/RIG-I receptor signaling pathway.

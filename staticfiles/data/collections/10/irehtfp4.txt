It is well-known that more than 350 drugs can cause unwanted effects in the lungs, bronchi, and neighboring structures of the thorax with a corresponding spectrum of pathological changes. Cardinal symptoms are often new onset of dyspnea on exertion and a cough that is usually dry. Further diagnostic work-up includes comprehensive pulmonary function testing with determination of diffusing capacity, high-resolution computed tomography, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. There is no specific pathological alteration for a defined drug. In case of doubt the potentially pneumotoxic drug should be discontinued. An attempt should be made to treat severely compromised lung function with systemic corticosteroids.

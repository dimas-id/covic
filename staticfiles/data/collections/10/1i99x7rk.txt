The threat of bioterrorism and the potential use of biological weapons against both military and civilian populations has become a major concern for governments around the world. For example, in 2001 anthrax-tainted letters resulted in several deaths, caused widespread public panic and exerted a heavy economic toll.

This review covers recent progress in developing therapeutic countermeasures against, and diagnostics for, such agents.

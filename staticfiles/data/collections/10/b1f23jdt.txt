Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), has led to tremendous economic losses in the global swine industry. Although the phylogeny of PEDV has been investigated extensively at the molecular level, there was no time-calibrated phylogenomic study on the virus. To improve insight into this topic, we analyzed 138 published genome sequences using the Bayesian coalescent analyses as well as Bayesian inferences and maximum likelihood methods. All of the global PEDV isolates were divided into six groups, except for one unclassified isolate. Of the six groups, Groups 1–5 comprised pandemic viruses while the remaining Group 6 contained classical isolates. Interestingly, the two clades, both pandemic and classical, consisted of clade-specific amino acid sequences in five genes: ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, and N. Within the pandemic clade, Group 1 and Group 2 originated from North America, whereas Group 3–Group 5 were derived from Asia. In Group 2, there was a common origin of S INDEL isolates. Within each group, there was no apparent association between temporal or geographic origin and heterogeneity of PEDVs. Our findings also showed that the PEDV virus evolved at a rate of 3.38 × 10(−4) substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus emerged 75.9 years ago. Our Bayesian skyline plot analysis indicated that the PEDV had maintained constant effective population size excluding only a short period, around 2012, when a valley shaped decline in the effective number of infections occurred.

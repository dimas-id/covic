Introduction: Clinical management and identification of respiratory diseases has become more rapid and increasingly specific due to widespread use of PCR(polymerase chain reaction) multiplex technologies. Although significantly improving clinical diagnosis, multiplexed PCR assays could have a greater impact on local and global disease surveillance. The authors wish to propose methods of evaluating respiratory multiplex assays to maximize diagnostic yields specifically for surveillance efforts. Areas covered: The authors review multiplexed assays and critically assess what barriers have limited these assays for disease surveillance and how these barriers might be addressed. The manuscript focuses specifically on the case study of using multiplexed assays for surveillance of respiratory pathogens. The authors also provide a method of validation of specific surveillance measures. Expert commentary: Current commercially available respiratory multiplex PCR assays are widely used for clinical diagnosis; however, specific barriers have limited their use for surveillance. Key barriers include differences in testing phase requirements and diagnostic performance evaluation. In this work the authors clarify phase testing requirements and introduce unique diagnostic performance measures that simplify the use of these assays on a per target basis for disease surveillance.

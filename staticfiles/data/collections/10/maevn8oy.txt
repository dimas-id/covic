The human antibody response has special significance in the ongoing efforts to develop a protective HIV vaccine. The observation that a subset of HIV infected individuals, who do not develop AIDS, have a broadly neutralizing antibody response has drawn attention to deciphering the nature of this response. It is hoped that an understanding of these protective antibodies, developed over time in response to the ongoing accumulation of mutations in the infecting virus, will facilitate the development of a vaccine that can elicit a similar response. This strategy will be greatly aided by the identification of broadly neutralizing monoclonal HIV antibodies from infected individuals. Several methods have been utilized to isolate and characterize individual antibodies from the human repertoire and each of these methods has been applied to the generation of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies, albeit with differing rates of success. This review describes several of these methods including human hybridoma; EBV transformation; non-immortalized B cell culture; clonal sorting; and combinatorial display. Key considerations used in the comparison of different methods includes: efficiency of interrogation of an individual's entire repertoire; assay formats that can be used to screen for antibodies of interest (i.e., binding versus biological assays); and the ability to recover native antibody heavy and light chain pairs.

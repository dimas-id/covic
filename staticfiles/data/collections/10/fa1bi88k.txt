BACKGROUND Extra-levator abdominoperineal excision of the rectum (ELAPER) for low rectal cancer is used to avoid the adverse oncological outcomes of inadvertent perforation and a positive circumferential resection margin associated with the conventional APER technique. This wider excision creates a large defect requiring pelvic floor reconstruction, and there is still controversy regarding the best method of closure. The aim of this study is to present outcomes of biological mesh pelvic floor reconstruction following ELAPER. METHODS Prospective data on consecutive patients having ELAPER for low rectal cancer at a single UK institution between October 2008 and March 2013 were collected. The perineum was reconstructed using a biological mesh and the short-term outcomes were evaluated, focusing particularly on perineal wound complications and perineal hernias. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were included [median age 62 years, range 40-72 years, 27 males (79 %)]. The median operative time was 248 min (range 120-340 min). The median length of hospital stay was 9 days (range 4-20 days). There were three perineal complications (9 %) requiring surgical intervention, but no meshes were removed. There were no perineal hernias. The median length of follow-up was 21 months (range 1-54 months). The overall mortality was 9 % from distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS Our series adds to the increasing evidence that good outcomes can be achieved for pelvic floor reconstruction with biological mesh following ELAPER without the additional use of myocutaneous flaps. The low serious complication rate, good outcomes in perineal wound healing and the absence of perineal hernias demonstrates that this is a safe and feasible procedure.

This chapter provides a summary of the global response to the AIDS pandemic and offers seven valuable lessons that can be learned from its history, which will hopefully be of value to the global community when confronted with future pandemics. These lessons relate to the behavior of donors, the importance of accountability, the need to understand the reality of the UN system, the advantage of a balanced and comprehensive approach to global challenges, and the importance of engaging civil society. The future of the World Health Organization, and its ability to provide leadership in addressing global pandemics and restore its credibility and legitimacy as the worldâ€™s leader in global health, is unclear. Hopefully, reforms now underway and the election of a new Director General, Tedros Ghebreyesus will enable this transformation.

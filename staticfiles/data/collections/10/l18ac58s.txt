Repair for an umbilical or epigastric hernia is one of the most frequently conducted gastrointestinal surgical procedures. Al-though it is a minor procedure, there is no consensus on the optimal repair technique. The readmission rate is surprisingly high due to postoperative pain, wound-related complications, and long-term results in terms of recurrence and chronic pain is not well investigated. The overall objective of this thesis was to improve early and long-term postoperative outcomes after repair for umbilical or epigastric hernias. The present thesis consisted of one RCT, one protocol article for a running RCT, and two register-based cohort studies. An abdominal binder had no analgesic effects or impact on seroma formation. We await early and late post-operative outcomes from a running RCT studying clinical effect of closing the hernia defect (inclusion is expected to end in October 2015). The two cohort studies included in the present theses found that mesh repair halved the long-term risk of recurrence compared with sutured repair. Mesh repair did not increase the risk of chronic pain or rate of reoperation for complications.

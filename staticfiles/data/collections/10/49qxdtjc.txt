COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent measures to mitigate it have presented the world with certain unprecedented situations. Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis, prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers. Within its limitations related to the quality and quantity of information sought, this comes as a viable method of patient -physician interfacing during the phase of lockdown.

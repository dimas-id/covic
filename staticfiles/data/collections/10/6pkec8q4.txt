INTRODUCTION Deteriorated alveolar structure at the base of blebs and bullae is known as the reticulated trabecula-like structure. Its clinical significance in primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the structure on recurrence of PSP after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) bullectomy. METHODS Between April 2010 and March 2014, 80 cases of PSP in 76 patients who underwent VATS bullectomy using endoscopic staplers were included. The staple line was covered with polyglycolic acid sheets and fibrin glue. Cases were assigned to a normal alveolar structure (NAS) group (n = 54) and a reticulated trabecula-like structure (RT) group (n = 26) based on the histological analysis. Factors associated with recurrence were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS The reticulated trabecula-like structure was significantly related to apical lung blebs. The recurrence rate of PSP was significantly higher in the RT group than in the NAS group (38.5% vs. 3.7%; P <0.001). On multivariate analysis, the reticulated trabecula-like structure was an independent factor for recurrence of PSP after VATS bullectomy. CONCLUSION The change of alveolar structure at the base of apical lung blebs would increase the risk for recurrence of PSP after VATS bullectomy.

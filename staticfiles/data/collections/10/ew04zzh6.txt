The CRISPR‐Cas system is a key technology for genome editing and regulation in a wide range of organisms and cell types. Recently, CRISPR‐Cas–based diagnostic platform has shown idealistic properties for pathogen detection. Integrating the CRISPR‐Cas platform along with lateral flow system allows rapid, sensitive, specific, cheap, and reliable diagnostic. It has the potential to be in frontline for not only pathogen detection during the epidemic outbreak, but also cancer, and genetic diseases.

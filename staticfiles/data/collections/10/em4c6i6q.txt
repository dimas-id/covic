A pandemic is a disease that spreads across a large area like multiple continents or worldwide. More than 211 nations are already affected by Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 declared Covid19 a pandemic. There are more than 1,282,931 cases of the coronavirus illness over 211 countries and territories around the world. Currently coronavirus has no proper treatment in Medical Science, increasing the number of affected people day by day with the number of cases worldwide of novel coronavirus surpassing 1,282,931, with some 72,616 deaths approximately. That is why the main objective of the present investigation is to identify the significant risk factor. Also, in this study we are continuously monitoring the spread of coronavirus. In this study we use a new TOPSIS MCDM approach and GMDH apply to select the significant risk factor and continuous monitoring of death due to Covid-19. Result indicates that “contamination due to contact with the infected person” is the main responsible factor behind the pandemic COVID-19. Also, in this investigation we get an optimal model by which we can monitor the death from Coronavirus within the affected person continuously.

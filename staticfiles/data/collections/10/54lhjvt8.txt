Twelve cattle with body wts ranging from 100 to 250 kg were treated using various doses and routes for four days with an E. coli derived alpha-hybrid interferon. The lowest parenteral doses (10(4) units per kg body wt) and the orally administered interferon did not lead to any disturbances, whereas the higher dosages led to marked changes in body temperature, pulse and respiration rates. Animals with the highest dose (10(8) units per kg body wt) became extremely distressed. The blood picture showed distinct changes, with very low leukocyte counts during treatment, which took weeks to recover. It is suggested that the dosages that did not lead to clinical symptoms are best suited for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes.

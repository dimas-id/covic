Background We evaluated the endotracheal tube cuff pressure (Pcuff) changes during pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the correlations between body mass index (BMI), pneumoperitoneum time, and Pcuff changes. Methods Total 60 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were allocated to either a study group (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) or a control group (BMI < 25 kg/m2). The endotracheal intubation was performed with a high-volume low-pressure cuffed oral endotracheal tube. A manometer was connected to the pilot balloon using a 3-way stopcock and the cuff was inflated. The change in Pcuff was defined as the difference between the pressure just before intra-abdominal CO2 insufflation and the pressure before CO2 desufflation. Results Pcuff increased to 5.3 ± 3.6 cmH2O in the study group and 5.7 ± 5.4 cmH2O in the control group. There was no significant difference between two groups. While BMI was not correlated with change in Pcuff (r = 0.022, p = 0.867), there was a significant correlation between change in Pcuff and the duration of pneumoperitoneum (r = 0.309, p = 0.016). Conclusion The change in Pcuff was not affected by BMI and was significantly correlated with pneumoperitoneum time. We recommend regular measurement and adjustment of Pcuff during laparoscopic surgery.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most critical risk factors for complications and death in COVID-19 patients. The present study aims to highlight challenges in the management of diabetic patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in developing countries. METHODS: We reviewed the literature to obtain information about diabetic care during the Covid-19 crisis. We also seek opinions of clinicians working in undeveloped countries. RESULTS: Current challenges faced by clinicians in the management of diabetic patients in developing countries are as follows: lack of preventive measures, inadequate number of visits, loss of the traditional method of communication with the patient, shortage of medications, impaired routine diabetic care, and absence of telehealth services. CONCLUSIONS: Developing countries are faced with many challenges in diabetes management due to a lack of resources.

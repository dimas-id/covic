Analysis of hospital admissions for 20 years suggests that there has been an increase in childhood asthma in Brisbane. The characteristic seasonal pattern of asthma with waves in autumn and spring is evident from the second year of age and continues into adult life. It has not been explained, although respiratory infections, allergens and cold changes probably contribute to it. Unlike adults, children shown an increase in asthma in February‐March, ascribed to infections spread at school. Maximal asthma is associated with a mean temperature of 20–21°C. This may be optimal for the production of allergens. Further viral studies of asthmatic attacks are desirable.

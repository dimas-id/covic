The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread disruption to routine surgical services across the globe. As the peak of the initial pandemic passes, surgeons will increasingly resume elective work to address the backlog. Whilst urgent cases such as cancer work will be prioritized, the safe resumption of facial plastic surgery will remain an ongoing challenge; particularly if there are secondary waves of infection. Rhinoplasty and nasal reconstructive surgery in particular poses a unique challenge to address due to the due to the potential for aerosolizing the virus. A task force of facial plastic surgeons from the European Academy of Facial Plastic Surgery has collaborated to create this document detailing recommendations for resuming a safe facial plastic surgery practice. These include the need to embrace telemedicine, advice on surgical prioritization, planning of clinical area flow plans, advice on pre-/peri- and postoperative care as well as recommendations on training for residents and well-being for surgeons. The recommendations have been made in line with the best available evidence in the literature and are applicable to facial plastic surgery colleagues from around the world in order to resume a safe practice.

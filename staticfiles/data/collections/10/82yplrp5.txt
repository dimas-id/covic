Nanometric hybrid gadolinium oxide particles (Gado-6Si-NP) for diagnostic and therapeutic applications (mean diameter 3-4 nm) were obtained by encapsulating Gd(2)O(3) cores within a polysiloxane shell, which carries organic fluorophore (Cy 5) and is derivatized by a hydrophilic carboxylic layer. As residency time in the living body and methods of waste elimination are crucial to defining a good nanoparticle candidate and moving forward with steps for validation, this study was aimed at evaluating the biodistribution of these multimodal Gado-6Si-NP in rodents. Gado-6Si-NP were imaged following intravenous injection in control Wistar rats and mice using MRI (7 T), optical fluorescent imaging, and SPECT. A clear correlation was observed among MRI, optical imaging, and SPECT regarding the renal elimination. Quantitative biodistribution using gamma-counting of each sampled organ confirmed that these nanoparticles circulated freely in the blood pool and were rapidly cleared by renal excretion without accumulation in liver and RES uptake. These results demonstrate that Gado-6Si-NP display optimal biodistribution properties, enabling them to be developed as multimodal agents for in vivo imaging and theragnostics, especially in oncological applications.

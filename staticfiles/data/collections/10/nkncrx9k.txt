INTRODUCTION A Bochdalek hernia (BH) is a type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. We herein describe an adult woman with a BH triggered by pregnancy and treated by laparoscopic surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 26-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of abdominal pain and dyspnea resulting from a left diaphragmatic hernia. She was diagnosed with a BH and underwent laparoscopic surgery. Her postoperative progress was satisfactory, and no recurrence was found at follow-up approximately 1 year later. DISCUSSION A recently published study reviewing detailed cases of laparoscopic and/or thoracoscopic repair of adult BH from 1999 to 2016 identified 30 cases. A laparoscopic approach for treatment of BH has recently attracted increasing interest. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery can be safely performed on adults with BH without complications.

The clinical, laboratory, and radiological features at presentation of 16 children (<12 years) with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pneumonia were compared with 32 age matched patients with community acquired pneumonia for determination of predictive factors that could allow early differentiation of the two conditions. A definitive contact history was the most important predictor for SARS. Raised serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration in the presence of low neutrophil count and serum creatine phosphokinase level at presentation also indicated an increased likelihood of SARS-coronavirus infection in young children.

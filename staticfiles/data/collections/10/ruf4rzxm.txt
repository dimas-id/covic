Summary Objective This survey was performed to assess the level of influenza vaccine coverage, to understand the driving forces and barriers to vaccination and determine vaccination interventions for the following year in Korean population. Methods A national sample of 1720 community dwelling adults of age 18 and older were surveyed by individual visits during April 2005. Demographics, state of influenza vaccination, reasons for vaccination or non-vaccination and perceptions on vaccinations were asked by questionnaire. Results Influenza vaccination coverage in general population and high risk group was 34.3% and 61.3%, respectively. Predictors for vaccination were â‰¥65 of age, performance of regular exercise, vaccination in the previous season, experience of influenza-like illness, belief that vaccine can prevent common cold and opinion that vaccine must be taken annually. The most common reason for vaccination for both whole population and high risk groups was to prevent both influenza and common cold, while the most common reason for non-vaccination was the thought that he/she was healthy enough not to be in need for vaccination. Having more information on influenza and vaccination as well as doctor's recommendation for vaccination appeared to be the most important modus operandi to encourage influenza vaccination among non-vaccinees. Conclusions Doctor's recommendation was the most important factor in encouraging people to be vaccinated against influenza. Doctors should be geared up with precise information and actively encourage high risk population in order to increase vaccination coverage.

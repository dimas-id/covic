Transgenics are powerful mouse models to understand the biological functions of genes. This chapter gives a short overview of the requirements and considerations in designing a transgene. In addition, potential important choices that have to be made in advance for the successful designing and generating a transgenic mouse model are discussed. Methods for DNA purification for microinjection are also provided in this chapter.

Discrete spatial heterogenity is introduced into disease transmission models, resulting in large systems of ordinary differential equations. Such metapopulation models describe disease spread on a number of spatial patches. In the first model considered, there is no explicit movement of individuals; rather infectives can pass the disease to susceptibles in other patches. The second type of model explicitly includes rates of travel between patches and also takes account of the resident patch as well as the current patch of individuals. A formula for and useful bounds on the basic reproduction number of the system are determined. Brief descriptions of application of this type of metapopulation model are given to investigate the spread of bovine tuberculosis and the effect of quarantine on the spread of influenza.

This chapter reviews the evidence that shows that arenaviruses and members of one genus of the Bunyaviridae (phleboviruses) have some proteins coded in subgenomic, viral-sense mRNA species and other proteins coded in subgenomic, viral-complementary mRNA sequences. This unique feature is discussed in relation to the implications it has on the intracellular infection process and how such a coding arrangement may have evolved. The chapter presents a list of the known members of the arenaviridae, their origins, and the vertebrate hosts from which isolates have been reported. It discusses the structural components, the infection cycle, and genetic attributes of arenaviruses. In order to determine how arenaviruses code for gene products, the S RNA species of Pichinde virus and that of a viscerotropic strain of LCM virus (LCM-WE) have been cloned into DNA and sequenced. The arenavirus S RNA is described as having an ambisense strategy, to denote the fact that both viral and viral-complementary sequences are used to make gene products. The chapter discusses the infection cycle, the structural and genetic properties of bunyaviridae member.

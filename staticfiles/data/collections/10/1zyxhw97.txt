In this study, we synthesized a novel kind of cellulose-based microfibers for efficient adsorption of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), the leading causative agent of life-threatening hand, foot and mouth disease. The initial cellulose microfibers (CEL) were activated by (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), and then covalently modified by polyglutamic acid (PGA) and mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), obtaining the microfibers CEL-PGA-MSN. Owing to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged components (i.e., PGA and MSN) and positively charged amino acids of the epitope of EV71 capsid protein VP2 (VP2-ep), the obtained microfibers strongly adsorbed the epitope, and exhibited high EV71-adsorption capacity. This study sheds a novel light on development of cellulose-based materials for application in virus-capturing equipment.

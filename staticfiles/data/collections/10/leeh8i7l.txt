Over the past decade, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that homogeneity in electrochemical performance of lithium-ion cells plays a major role in determining the life and safety of lithium-ion battery modules or packs. Generally, the homogeneity of a battery pack is evaluated by characterizing the cells individually in terms of capacity, mass, impedance. Particularly, high quality electrochemical data heavily relies on the availability of high precision current source to minimize the discrepancy induced by the channel-to-channel variation. Here, a facile and precise measurement method is reported for screening cell-to-cell variations, in which voltage is the only indicator parameter independent of high precision current source. In detail, by connecting the cells in series (CiS), the measurement error of electrochemical data caused by stability and discrepancy of current sources among different charge/discharge equipment can be effectively avoided. The findings of this work showed that the cell-to-cell variations can be simply and sensitively detected with CiS configuration. For example, the relative standard deviation, which is the evaluation criterion of battery homogeneity, was 2.14% based on CiS while it was 0.43% based on individual measurements. The simple and precise CiS measurement is promising for evaluation of cell quality or module integration quality. In addition, this work can also provide a solid foundation for the development of detection algorithms for battery management systems to rapidly monitor battery homogeneity.

Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed in two Asiatic black bears ( Ursus thibetanus ). Bears were placed in a 20° Trendelenburg position on a surgical table. A three-portal technique was used. A camera port was established 10 cm caudal to the umbilicus with a 5-mm cannula. Two instrument ports were made 1 cm caudal to the umbilicus with a 5-mm cannula and 8 cm caudal to the camera port with a 12-mm cannula, respectively. The suspensory ligament, ovarian vasculature, and uterine horn tip were progressively dissected following coagulation with the Sonicision™ cordless ultrasonic dissection device. The resected ovary was exteriorized through the 12-mm instrument portal site but enlarged to a 2-cm incision length. The abdominal musculature, subcutaneous tissue, and skin of the portal sites were closed separately. Total surgical time was 113 min (Bear A) and 49 min (Bear B), and no postoperative complications were encountered. This is the first report of laparoscopic ovariectomy in the Asiatic black bear.

Utilizing a scientometric review of global trends and structure from 388 bibliographic records over two decades (1999â€“2018), this study seeks to advance the building of comprehensive knowledge maps that draw upon global travel demand studies. The study, using the techniques of co-citation analysis, collaboration network and emerging trends analysis, identified major disciplines that provide knowledge and theories for tourism demand forecasting, many trending research topics, the most critical countries, institutions, publications, and articles, and the most influential researchers. The increasing interest and output for big data and machine learning techniques in the field were visualized via comprehensive knowledge maps. This research provides meaningful guidance for researchers, operators and decision makers who wish to improve the accuracy of tourism demand forecasting.

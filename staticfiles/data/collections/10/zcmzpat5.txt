To develop diagnostics and detection methods, current research is focussed on targeting the detection of coronavirus based on its RNA. Besides the RNA target, research reports are coming to develop diagnostics by targeting structure and other parts of coronavirus. PCR based detection system is widely used and various improvements in the PCR based detection system can be seen in the recent research reports. This review will discuss multiple detection methods for coronavirus for developing appropriate, reliable, and fast alternative detection methods. Considering the current scenario of COVID-19 diagnostics around the world and an urgent need for the development of reliable and cheap diagnostic, various techniques based on CRISPR technology, antibody, MIP, LAMP, microarray, etc. should be discussed and tried.

Fever with renal syndrome is currently endemic in Eurasia, where the main etiological agents are the Hantaan and Seoul viruses in Asia (China, South Korea, and the Far East of Russia), in addition to the Seoul, Puumala, and Dobrava viruses in Europe (central, northern, Alpine Massif, Balkans, and western Russia). Lethality rates are higher with Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections (5–10%) when compared to the Puumala and Seoul viruses (1%). With the expansion and geographical migration of the urban rodent (Rattus norvegicus) from the “Old World,” the Seoul virus was introduced into the Americas and is now considered a virus with a cosmopolitan distribution. On the American continent, the presence of the Seoul virus has been confirmed in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States. The hantavirus transmission to humans occurs by inhalation of aerosol-dispersed viral particles present in rodent droppings and saliva. This disease should be clinically differentiated from leptospirosis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers that occur in the same areas of occurrence of hantavirus infections. There is no treatment with antiviral drugs specific for hantavirus. Faced to a suspected hantavirus case, it should be communicated to the local health authorities and provide an eventually intensive care unit support.

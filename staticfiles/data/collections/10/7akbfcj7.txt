Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (IαI) family members are ancient and unique molecules that have evolved over several hundred million years of vertebrate evolution. IαI is a complex containing the proteoglycan bikunin to which heavy chain proteins are covalently attached to the chondroitin sulfate chain. Besides its matrix protective activity through protease inhibitory action, IαI family members interact with extracellular matrix molecules and most notably hyaluronan, inhibit complement, and provide cell regulatory functions. Recent evidence for the diverse roles of the IαI family in both biology and pathology is reviewed and gives insight into their pivotal roles in tissue homeostasis. In addition, the clinical uses of these molecules are explored, such as in the treatment of inflammatory conditions including sepsis and Kawasaki disease, which has recently been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children.

To date, no therapy has demonstrated definite efficacy for patients with COVID‐19. Antiviral, as well as, anti‐inflammatory approaches, as these represented by remdesivir (RDV) and tocilizumab (TCZ) use, have been recently put forward. However, data upon optimal choice of one over the other, or potential need for regimen combination, remains an open question. We hereby report two well‐matched cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 (+) patients, developing respiratory failure, both receiving TCZ following severe inflammatory response, with or without RDV. We argue that, RDV administration is pivotal early in the course of the disease, since TCZ use alone cannot ensure inflammation control. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Abstract In this paper, the molecular connectivity indices were applied to theoretically predict the direct chemiluminescence (CL) behavior of chrysin and baicalein with our recently proposed discriminant function. Then, combined with flow-injection analysis, a new CL system for determination of chrysin and baicalein was proposed. The method was based on the oxidation of chrysin and baicalein by acidic KMnO4 in the presence of formaldehyde to produce strong CL emission. The present paper suggested a new model to discover new CL analytical system: first, to theoretical predict the CL behavior, and the second, to suggest analytical system.

Kapusinszky et al. (J Virol 89:8152-8161, 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00671-15) report that host population bottlenecks may result in pathogen extinction, which provides a compelling argument for an alternative approach to vaccination for the control of virus spread. By comparing the prevalence levels of three viral pathogens in two populations of African green monkeys (AGMs) (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from Africa and two Caribbean Islands, they convincingly show that a major host bottleneck resulted in the eradication of select pathogens from a given host.

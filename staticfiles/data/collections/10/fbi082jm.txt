Abstract The operating environment of an airport is affecting its financial performance. This will be worked out for different regions and size brackets, based on empirical airport data provided by ACI’s economic surveys. This chapter will also investigate influencing factors such as major traffic flows and their consequences for airport demand as well as site-specific circumstances, including aviation policy. Due to their importance for the economic development of a region, airports have frequently been subject to political activities. This chapter’s feature is on potential effects of aviation policy on regional airports. It is focusing on the European Commission’s 2014 guidelines on state aid and their amendment as of May 2017.

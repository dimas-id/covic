The use of multiphase flows in microfluidics to carry dispersed phase material (droplets, particles, bubbles, or fibers) has many applications. In this review paper, we focus on such flows on centrifugal microfluidic platforms and present different methods of dispersed phase material generation. These methods are classified into three specific categories, i.e., step emulsification, crossflow, and dispenser nozzle. Previous works on these topics are discussed and related parameters and specifications, including the size, material, production rate, and rotational speed are explicitly mentioned. In addition, the associated theories and important dimensionless numbers are presented. Finally, we discuss the commercialization of these devices and show a comparison to unveil the pros and cons of the different methods so that researchers can select the centrifugal droplet/particle generation method which better suits their needs.

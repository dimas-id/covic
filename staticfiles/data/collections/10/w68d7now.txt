A molecular beacon (MB) is a hairpin-structured oligonucleotide probe containing a photoluminescent species (PLS) and a quencher at different ends of the strand. In a recognition and detection process, the hybridization of MBs with target DNA sequences restores the strong photoluminescence, which is quenched before hybridization. Making better MBs involves reducing the background photoluminescence and increasing the brightness of the PLS, which therefore involves the development of new PLS and quenchers, as well as innovative PLS-quencher systems. Heavy-metal complexes, nanocrystals, pyrene compounds, and other materials with excellent photophysical properties have been applied as PLS of MBs. Nanoparticles, nanowires, graphene, metal films, and many other media have also been introduced to quench photoluminescence. On the basis of their high specificity, selectivity, and sensitivity, MBs are developed as a general platform for sensing, producing, and carrying molecules other than oligonucleotides.

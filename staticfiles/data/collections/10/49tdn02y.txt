We have performed retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy for living kidney donor surgery since 2000. Recently, we introduced single-site retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (RDN) as a less invasive donor surgery. The procedure was performed in 7 donors (5 women and 2 men) by a single surgeon. The mean age and body mass index of the donors were 62.6 years (range, 53-74 years) and 24.3 kg/m(2) (range, 22.3-29.0 kg/m(2)), respectively. Left-sided nephrectomy was performed in all the donors. The donors were positioned in the right lateral position, and a 7-cm-long incision was made in the left flank. The incision was extended to the retroperitoneal space using the muscle-splitting technique. The retroperitoneal space was then expanded using an inflation balloon. A GelPOINT Advanced Access Platform (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif, United States) was placed in the incision. The subsequent technique and equipment were the same as those used in conventional 3-port RDN. The renal artery and vein were dissected using a vascular stapler, and the kidney graft was directly extracted through the incision. The mean operative time was 197 ± 28 minutes, warm ischemic time was 4.1 ± 1.2 minutes, and blood loss was 75 ± 113 mL. No statistical differences were found between the present method and conventional 3-port RDN. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were not observed in any of the donors. Graft function after transplantation was good, and delayed graft function was not observed in any of the recipients. This technique can be easily introduced in the clinical setting by surgeons experienced in RDN.

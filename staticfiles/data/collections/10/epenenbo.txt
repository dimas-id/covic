The present study examines the implementation of social robots in real settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we analyze the areas in which social robots are being adopted, the roles and tasks being fulfilled, and the robot models being implemented. For that, we traced back and analyzed 195 experiences with 66 different social robots worldwide that have been adopted during the coronavirus outbreak. We identified a clear resurgence and expansion of social robots during the crisis. The social robots' capacity to perform the roles of liaison in tasks that require human-human interaction, to act as a safeguard to ensure contagion risk-free environments, and to act as well-being coaches by providing therapeutic and entertaining functions for quarantined patients, which are directly associated with the needs of facilitating physical distance and palliate the effects of isolation, have been key to the renaissance of these robots during the pandemic.

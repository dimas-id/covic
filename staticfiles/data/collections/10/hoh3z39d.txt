An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for detecting antibody rises to human coronavirus strain 229E and related strains in paired sera from infected volunteers. There was a close correlation between development of colds infected volunteers. There was a close correlation between development of colds and significant antibody rises detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, the assay was more sensitive than a neutralization assay. This enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an easy, accurate, and sensitive assay for measuring significant antibody rises to human coronavirus strain 229E group viruses, and it could be useful in the clinical diagnosis of these infections.

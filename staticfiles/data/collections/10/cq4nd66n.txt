Abstract Phototherapies, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), have been widely used in the treatment of various diseases, especially for cancer. However, there is still a lack of effective, safe photosensitizers that would be well tolerated by patients. The combination of several methods (like phototherapy and hyperthermia) constitutes a modern therapeutic approach, which demands new materials based on components that are non-toxic without irradiation. Therefore, this study presents the synthesis and properties of novel, advanced nanomaterials in which the advantage features of the magnetic nanoparticles and photoactive compounds were combined. The primary purpose of this work was the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles coated with biocompatible and antitumor polysaccharide - levan, previously unknown from scientific literature, and the deposition of potent photosensitizer – zinc(II) phthalocyanine on their surface. In order to better characterize the nature of the coating covering the magnetic core, the atomic force microscope analysis, a contact angle measurement, and the mechanical properties of pure levan and its blend with zinc(II) phthalocyanine films were investigated. This magnetic nanomaterial revealed the ability to generate singlet oxygen upon exposure to light. Finally, preliminary toxicity of obtained nanoparticles was tested using the Microtox® test – with and without irradiation.

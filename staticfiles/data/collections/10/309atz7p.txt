Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of advanced NSCLC. With the intention of generating an anti-tumor immune response, ICIs can also lead to inflammatory side effects involving a wide variety of organs in the body, termed immune-related adverse events. Although no prospective clinical trial exists to guide recommendations for optimal and more specific immunosuppressive treatments rather than corticosteroids, further studies may lead to a more mechanistic-based approach towards these toxicities in the future. In relation to current practice, we recommend adherence to the recent published guidelines which emphasize the importance of early recognition and administration of temporary immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids in most cases, depending on the organ system involved, and the severity of toxicity. Recognition of these toxicities is increasingly important as the use of these agents expand within different indications for patients with lung cancers, and to other tumor types.

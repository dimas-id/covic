This article presents conceptual and methodological frameworks to prioritise interventions on the Colombian P\'aramo. The mode of analysis that our work takes up is that of questioning value and related categories as definite empirically perceived phenomena. We contend that the valuation of ecosystem services -- even in its post-normal forms -- and the ecosystem services framework not only fail to examine value-based categories, but reproduce the problematic aspects of value-based social relations, which ultimately bear on the ecological issues affecting the P\'aramo. Upon this premise we set out to formalise a (computational) dialogical scenario where arguments stating distinct, and often contradictory, actions delineate possible forms of appropriating the P\'aramo, while motivating the examination of their defining sociality.

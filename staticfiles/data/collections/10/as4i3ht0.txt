BACKGROUND To present our initial experience with electrothermal bipolar vessel device and only 2 expandable ports for laparoscopic Palomo varicocele procedure in pediatric and adolescent population. METHODS In a 3-year period between 2006 and 2009, sixty-three boys and adolescents diagnosed in our institution as having varicocele underwent Palomo laparoscopic surgery with a two 5-mm expandable-trocar laparoscopic approach using the LigaSure technology (Valleylab Inc., Covidien, Boulder, CO) for spermatic vessels sealing. The outcome variables recorded for analysis were age at presentation, symptoms, varicocele grade based on Dubin and Amelar Classification, testicular atrophy, operative time, complications, recurrence, and reactive hydrocele formation. Mean follow-up was 1.8 years (range, 6 mo to 3 y). RESULTS Children's age at diagnosis ranged between 9 and 19 years. Mean age at operation was 14.8 ± 1.2 years. All cases were left side varicoceles and 70% had grade III varicocele. Testicular atrophy was noticed in 39.8% of cases. All boys underwent Palomo laparoscopic sealing of the spermatic vessels using bipolar vascular electrothermal device Ligasure with a 2-trocar approach. Mean operative surgery time was 21 minutes. Median hospital stay was 21 ± 8 hours. No conversion cases were registered. Nine patients developed hydrocele after laparoscopic procedure (14.2%). Three patients of these cases underwent Winkelman-Lord's hydrocelectomy (4.7% of total). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic Palomo varicocele surgery for pediatric patients using Ligasure as spermatic vessels sealant and only 2 radially expandable 5-mm trocars is a safe, feasible, and time-effective technical improvement.

Alveolar epithelial type I cells cover most of the internal surface area of the lungs. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate that alveolar epithelial type I cell damage is frequently observed in acute and chronic lung diseases. This article discusses the use of cell-selective proteins as markers for the investigation of injury and repair of the alveolar epithelium. The utility of proteins specific to alveolar epithelial type I cells as diagnostic markers of alveolar epithelial injury in acute lung injury is considered, and expression of proteins selective for alveolar epithelial type I cells in lungs following injury and in fibrosis are discussed.

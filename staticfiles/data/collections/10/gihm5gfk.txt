AIM To identify and describe published, nursing-led and midwifery-led, clinical research that has been conducted in Latin America and the Caribbean. BACKGROUND Peer-reviewed published research may correspond to and elucidate country's realities, priorities, and needs. DESIGN A 6-stage scoping review methodology was used to search scientific databases using an applied search strategy. DATA SOURCES Five databases were searched for articles published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese conducted in a Latin American or Caribbean country between January 1, 2006 and June 14, 2016. REVIEW METHODS Articles were independently considered for inclusion by 2 researchers, data extracted, and study characteristics described. RESULTS Of 6922 articles identified, 404 were included. The majority were conducted in Brazil (90.6%) followed by Chile (2.5%). Most were nurse-led (95.8%) and were implemented in hospitals (48.6%). Studies frequently explored patient knowledge or characterized patient populations (61.3%) and commonly assessed chronic disease (19.3%) or maternity/child health outcomes (15.9%). CONCLUSION Findings revealed a large number of publications but an uneven geographical distribution of nurse-led clinical research and an evident gap of midwifery-related research in Latin America and the Caribbean. Results may be used to build research agendas to promote nursing and midwifery research capacity and further establish evidence-based practice.

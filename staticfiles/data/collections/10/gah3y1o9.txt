Herein we report the case of a 68-year-old woman who had rectal bleeding 13 days after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. Clinical examination and rectoscopy revealed rectal exposure of the posterior polyester mesh placed during the surgery. Endorectal surgery was performed to remove the exposed mesh and repair the rectal erosion. No further complications occurred during follow-up. Although vaginal erosions are a well-known complication of synthetic implants after surgery to repair pelvic organ prolapse, one must keep in mind the possibility of more uncommon types of mesh exposure.

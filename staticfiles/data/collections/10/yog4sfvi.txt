Infectious diseases are a group of diseases which have complex transmission ways and various influencing factors. Clarifying the correlation between ambient temperature and major infectious diseases in China is a crucial step toward the successful control of infectious diseases including vector-borne diseases, water-borne diseases, food-borne diseases, respiratory infectious diseases, etc. and the implementations of climate change adaption strategy and measures in China. However, no study has systematically reviewed the available evidences on the impact of ambient temperature on the incidence of major infectious diseases, and such information is essential for policymakers and stakeholders to take specific actions to control infectious diseases and protect the vulnerable population in the future. In order to fill this gap, we systematically review the current evidence for the effect of ambient temperature on major infectious diseases in China. The findings could provide explicit information for the scientific prevention and control of infectious diseases in China.

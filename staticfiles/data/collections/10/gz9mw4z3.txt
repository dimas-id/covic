Management of a difficult airway caused by pathology below the glottis is high-risk and requires a shared approach to airway planning and surgical treatment. Access to the trachea requires a careful assessment of the airway since the end-point of laryngoscopy for infraglottic airway management is not visualization of the larynx for tube placement, but access to the laryngotracheal complex in cases where intubation may not be feasible or may preclude surgical access. This work 23 provides a common framework for creating multidisciplinary shared-airway management plans and presents devices and strategies that have in recent years improved airway management safety in this difficult patient group and may prove useful in the settings of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

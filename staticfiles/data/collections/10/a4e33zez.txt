INTRODUCTION The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used to treat various rheumatic diseases. Many autoimmune diseases occur in women of child-bearing age who may become pregnant while on therapy, which raises concerns regarding the teratogenicity of HCQ and its effect on the outcome of the pregnancy. There is a lack of data regarding the safety of HCQ during pregnancy. AREAS COVERED In this review, the authors attempt to identify relevant publications by searching MEDLINE, Cochrane database, Ovid-Currents Clinical Medicine, Ovid-Embase:Drugs and Pharmacology, EBSCO, Web of Science and SCOPUS using the search terms HCQ and/or pregnancy. A basis for the mechanism of action of HCQ is provided. EXPERT OPINION HCQ has been shown by numerous studies over the past 15 years to be efficacious in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, discoid lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. HCQ does not appear to be associated with any increased risk of congenital defects, spontaneous abortions, fetal death, prematurity or decreased numbers of live births in patients with autoimmune diseases. Therefore, in the author's opinion, HCQ is safe for the treatment of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy.

Isodeoxyelephantopin (IDET) has been identified as an anti-tumor natural constituent whose anti-tumor activity and mechanism have been widely investigated. Since the occurrence and development of cancer usually accompany with inflammation, and tumor signaling shares many components with inflammation signaling, the agents with anti-tumor activity are likely to possess anti-inflammation potential. Thus, the current study aims to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity along with the underlying mechanism of IDET in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages. By using Griess method and ELISA, we found that in both bone marrow derived macrophages and alveolar macrophage cell line, IDET, at relatively low concentrations (0.75, 1.5 and 3 µM), could inhibit LPS-induced expression of various pro-inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO) generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-1ß. Meanwhile, in activated MH-S cells, the inhibitory action of IDET on mRNA expression levels of these cytokines was also detected using qPCR. Mechanistically, the effects of IDET on two key inflammatory signalings, nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) pathways, were determined in LPS-activated MH-S cells by reporter gene along with western blot assays. On the one hand, IDET suppressed NF-&#954;B signaling via down-regulating phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of NF-&#954;B (I&#954;B)-&#945; and the subsequent p65 translocation. On the other hand, IDET dampened AP-1 signaling through attenuating phosphorylation of both c-jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Our study indicates that IDET might be a promising constituent from the anti-inflammatory herb Elephantopus scaber Linn. in mitigating inflammatory conditions, especially respiratory inflammation.

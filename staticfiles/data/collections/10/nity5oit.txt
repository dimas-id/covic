In reconstructive surgery, transfer of patients' tissue (autologous flaps) is routinely used to repair large soft tissue defects caused by surgery, trauma, chronic diseases, or malformations; unfortunately, this strategy is not always possible and often creates a secondary defect in the donor site of the tissue. Tissue-engineered synthetic flaps are currently unable to repair clinically-relevant, large-volume defects; allogenic flaps from cadaveric donors could provide a ready-to-use biological alternative if treated with methods to avoid the immune-rejection of the donor's cells. Here, we describe the successful decellularization of a large (> 800 cc) human-derived adipose flap through a perfusion apparatus; we demonstrate the complete removal of the immunogenic cellular components of the flap with the retention of its structural components and vascular network. Our aim is to obtain a universally compatible, off-the-shelf acellular allogenic flap that could be recellularized with cells from recipient patients to provide a tissue-engineered allogenic/autologous alternative for reconstruction of large-volume soft-tissue defects.

BACKGROUND The majority of pancreases, offered in allocation, are not transplanted. This pancreas under-utilisation is a phenomenon observed in all transplant systems in North-America and Europe. It was the aim of this study to analyse factors predictive of pancreas non-transplantation in Germany. METHODS Routine Eurotransplant data of 3,666 deceased German donors (from 2002-2011) were used for multivariate modelling. Socio-demographic and medical factors were considered as independent variables in logistic regression models with non-transplantation as dependent variable. RESULTS Male gender, advanced age, overweight/obesity, long ICU stay, a history of smoking, non-traumatic brain death, elevated levels of sodium, serum glucose, lipase/amylase and the liver not being considered for procurement were significant independent predictors of non-transplantation. CONCLUSION In line with previous research, advanced age, high BMI, long ICU stay and the liver not being considered for procurement were the strongest predictors of pancreas non-transplantation in Germany. About three quarters of the variance remained unexplained, suggesting that factors not assessed or unknown may play a decisive role.

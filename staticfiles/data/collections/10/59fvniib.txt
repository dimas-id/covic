Video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) is a common technique for thoracic operations. Surgery with access via a single port has gradually become popular. We herein report the unusual case of a 53-year-old Japanese male patient whose chest X-rays revealed an abnormal shadow, which continued to increase in size. The tumor was excised by single-port access surgery. The resected tumor was a pedunculated pleural mass, yellowish in color, and pathological diagnosis confirmed a lipoma. We describe the first known successful treatment by single-port VATS.

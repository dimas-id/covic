Mesenteric lymphangiomas, which involve near total mesentery, are extremely rare. A mesenteric lymphangioma should be treated through excision because they can cause invasion of vital structures, bleeding, or infection. After excision of a huge mesenteric lymphangioma, internal herniation may occur through a large mesenteric defect leading to intestinal volvulus, obstruction, and other life-threatening circumstances. We report a case in which a biologic collagen implant (Permacol) was used for mesenteric defect repair after excision of a huge mesenteric lymphangioma. The implant did not cause any symptoms or complications during follow-up for 4 years. When encountering large defects of mesentery, closure with implant can be a feasible choice, and Permacol could be a possible implant for closing the defect.

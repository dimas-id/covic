Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in China on December 2019. Almost 5 months into the pandemic, little is still known about cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19. In fact, the prevalence of cutaneous signs varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 0.2% to 20.4%. Given their potential association with COVID-19, acral lesions have received special attention worldwide, both in the medical literature and the media. Our aim is to share our experience regarding acral manifestations during this pandemic.

Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density. The peak bone mass (PBM) is a significant determinant of osteoporosis. To gain insights into the indicating effect of PBM to osteoporosis, this study focused on characterizing the PBM networks and identifying key genes. One biological data set with 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples was derived to construct protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs). Based on clique-merging, module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. The systematic calculation and comparison were performed to test whether the network entropy can discriminate the low PBM network from high PBM network. We constructed 32 destination networks with 66 modules divided from monocyte low and high PBM networks. Among them, network 11 was the only significantly differential one (P<0.05) with 8 nodes and 28 edges. All genes belonged to precursors of osteoclasts, which were related to calcium transport as well as blood monocytes. In conclusion, based on the entropy in PBM PPINs, the differential network appears to be a novel therapeutic indicator for osteoporosis during the bone monocyte progression; these findings are helpful in disclosing the pathogenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis.

PURPOSE The management of esophageal atresia is established, but the rate of postoperative complications remains high. We focused on a new, recently reported method of esophageal elongation using botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and evaluated the efficacy of BTX-A injection around esophageal anastomoses with tension in a rabbit model. METHODS Twenty rabbits aged 8-10 weeks and weighing 1.27-1.72 kg underwent resections of the esophagus measuring 1.5 cm long using an anterior cervical approach. Esophagoesophagostomies were performed after intramural administration of Xeominâ„¢ (3 U/body) in the BTX-A group and saline in the control group. Morphological and histological evaluations were examined on postoperative day 14. RESULTS Six rabbits in each group survived. The BTX-A group showed significantly less postoperative anastomotic stricture and less fibrosis than the control group. Changes in wall thickness on both sides of the anastomotic areas were equivalent between the two groups, and no muscle fracturing was observed. CONCLUSION Local administration of BTX-A for esophagoesophagostomy significantly reduced postoperative anastomotic stricture with less fibrosis than that observed in the control group. Reduced anastomotic tension with BTX-A presumably contributed to better anastomotic healing. Determining the optimum dose of BTX-A is necessary for clinical application.

Five recombinant porcine adenoviruses of serotype 5 (PAdV-5) carrying the full-length or the 5' 2.2 kb half of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spike (S) gene were generated by homologous recombination in E. coli strain BJ5183 cells and subsequent transfection of swine testicle cells. The foreign genes were inserted into the E3 region of PAdV-5. One recombinant virus had no deletion in the E3 region, whereas a 1.2 kb fragment was removed from the E3 region in the remainder of the recombinant viruses. One stable construct with a 4.4 kb insertion had a genome size of 109.6% of the wild-type genome, the largest reported for any recombinant adenovirus. Only those viruses that carried the S gene in the left to right orientation expressed the S gene. Three recombinant viruses were tested by oral immunization of pigs and both antibody response and virus shedding were monitored. None of the pigs showed clinical signs and the virus was recovered from rectal swabs until 6-7 days post-infection. Viruses expressing the S gene induced TGEV- and PAdV-5-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, TGEV-specific secretory IgA was detected in the small intestine and in the lungs of the immunized animals.

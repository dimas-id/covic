One health is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working together to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. One health is thus at the intersection of human, animal, and environment health, and in the one health paradigm, these three different domains merge into one superposed and universal goal. The number of outbreaks around the world is increasing, in terms of total number and diversity of outbreaks and the richness of pathological agents. Identifying the origin of these outbreaks is important to ensure appropriate capacity to respond to potentially pandemic threats. Many (re-)emerging pathogens come from animals, and there is a compelling need to understand the epidemiology of these diseases, including the role of animals as disease reservoirs. In parallel, the progressive phasing out of antibiotics in animal foods around the world has been achieved through active collaboration of physicians and veterinarians, and it is to be hoped that this continued interaction will help align human and veterinary medicine with the objectives of the one health paradigm. Indeed, a multi-sector cooperative approach between human and veterinarian health will contribute to improved preparedness and capacity for response to current and future health threats using the one health concept.

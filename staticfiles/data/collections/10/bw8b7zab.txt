Abstract Penguins are flightless seabirds with unique anatomy. Although susceptible to a wide range of diseases, aspergillosis and avian malaria dominate captive mortalities, whereas starvation impacts free-ranging colonies. Gastrointestinal foreign bodies, pododermatitis, drug and heavy metal toxicities are relevant in captivity; oil and algal biotoxicities in the wild. Arthropod-borne, pox-, and herpesviruses are significant for captive and free-ranging populations. Important bacterial diseases include salmonellosis, clostridiosis, and the polymicrobial contribution to penguin diphtheria. Free-ranging populations frequently harbor metazoan parasites but avian malaria is the most clinically important parasitic disease. Many Pelecaniformes, Gaviiformes, Podicipediformes, and Procellariiformes are pelagic species that congregate periodically in nesting colonies or during migration. For free-ranging pelagic species, information derives from infrequent opportunistic screening as sentinels of ocean health and pathogen circulation, and mass mortality events. Birds in captive populations, whose life history differs dramatically, are sparsely represented. Nutritional stress, infectious disease, and toxins contribute to morbidity in congregating birds. Adverse anthropogenic influences (population growth, climate change, environmental pollution, and intensive fishing) pose conservation threats.

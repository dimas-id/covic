We investigated the potential use of a spectral surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor in a high‐throughput analysis of mumps virus and a mumps virus‐specific mAb on the arrays of a cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA). The PDDA surface was constructed by electrostatic adsorption of the polyelectrolyte onto a monolayer of 11‐mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA). Poly‐l‐lysine was also adsorbed onto the MUA monolayer and compared with the PDDA surface in the capacity of mumps virus immobilization. The PDDA surface showed a higher adsorption of mumps virus than the poly‐l‐lysine surface. The SPR signal caused by the virus binding onto the PDDA surface was proportional to the concentration of mumps virus from 0.5 × 10(5) to 14 × 10(5) pfu/mL. The surface structure of the virus arrays was visualized by atomic force microscopy. Then, a dose‐dependent increase in the SPR signal was observed when various concentrations of the antimumps virus antibody in buffer or human serum were applied to the virus arrays, and their interaction was specific. Thus, it is likely that the spectral SPR biosensor based on the cationic polyelectrolyte surface may provide an efficient system for a high‐throughput analysis of intact virus and serodiagnosis of infectious diseases.

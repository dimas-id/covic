The Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) possesses a variety of unique features which make them desirable research models. Despite these features, experimental use of the hamster has declined over the past 20–30 years. The current chapter will focus on research and literature describing the experimental use of the hamster with a particular emphasis on research done since the previous edition of this text (1987–present).

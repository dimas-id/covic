Abstract The Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a substantial effect on the health care systems around the world. As the disease has spread, many developed and developing countries have been stretched on their resources such as personnel as well as adequate equipment. As a result of resource disparity, in a populous country like India, the elective orthopaedic surgeries stand cancelled whilst trauma and emergency services have been reorganised following Indian Orthopaedic Association and recent urgent British Orthopaedic association guidelines. Though these guidelines provide strategies to deal with trauma and orthopaedic surgery management in the present scenario, once the COVID-19 pandemic stabilizes, restarting elective orthopaedic surgery and managing delayed trauma conditions in evolving health care systems is going to be a profound task. We look at the future challenges and considerations of re-establishing trauma and orthopaedic flow during the post-COVID-19 phase and suggest an algorithm to follow (Fig. 1).

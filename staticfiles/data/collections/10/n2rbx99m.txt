In response to the report of Carreras‐Presas et al. (2020) in which they present 3 cases with vesico‐bullous oral lesions associated with SARS‐Cov‐2 infection and with very interesting findings, however we cannot consider the possibility that findings be intrinsic related to COVID‐19 disease. The first two cases presented did not have laboratory confirmation of COVID‐19 infection, but the authors reported that these patients had compatible signs and symptoms.

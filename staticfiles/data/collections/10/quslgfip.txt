Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a zoonotic disease that causes severe haemorrhagic fever, with high fatality rates of up to 90% in humans. Today, there is no effective treatment available. Person‐to‐person transmission occurs through exposure to blood or body fluids, which can threaten other household members and first‐line healthcare workers. The first cases of EVD in Guinea were identified on 22 March 2014. It was initially believed that this like previous outbreaks would be self‐limiting. However, lack of public health infrastructure, delays in virus detection and late implementation of control interventions contributed to widespread transmission of EVD in a region inexperienced in dealing with the disease. Socio‐cultural and economic factors probably also played a key role in the spread of the disease, resulting in the current large‐scale outbreak. Some promising candidate treatments for this disease are now being developed.

Abstract Objectives This study investigates current policies, key issues, and needs for pandemic planning in pediatrics in Canada. Methods Online pandemic plans from national, provincial and territorial government websites were reviewed to identify: plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. A survey was administered to gather participants’ perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations’ and regions’ pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. Results The majority of existing plans did not adequately address the unique needs of pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified parallel gaps, in their organization's or region's plans. Conclusions Although many plans provide guidelines for medical and policy issues in pediatrics, much more work remains in psychosocial and ethical planning. A focus on children and families is needed for pandemic planning in pediatrics to ensure best outcomes for children and families.

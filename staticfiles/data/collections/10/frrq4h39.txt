The outbreak of COVID‐19 in China has led to massive lockdowns in order to reduce the spread of the epidemic and control human‐to‐human transmission. Subsequent reductions in various anthropogenic activities have led to improved air quality during the lockdown. In this study, we apply a widely used exposure‐response function to estimate the short‐term health impacts associated with PM(2.5) changes over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region due to COVID‐19 lockdown. Concentrations of PM(2.5) during lockdown period reduced by 22.9% to 54.0% compared to pre‐lockdown level. Estimated PM(2.5)‐related daily premature mortality during lockdown period is 895 (95% confidential interval: 637‐1081), which is 43.3% lower than pre‐lockdown period and 46.5% lower compared with averages of 2017‐2019. According to our calculation, total number of avoided premature death associated PM(2.5) reduction during the lockdown is estimated to be 42.4 thousand over the YRD region, with Shanghai, Wenzhou, Suzhou (Jiangsu province), Nanjing, and Nantong being the top five cities with largest health benefits. Avoided premature mortality is mostly contributed by reduced death associated with stroke (16.9 thousand, accounting for 40.0%), ischemic heart disease (14.0 thousand, 33.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.6 thousand, 18.0%). Our calculations do not support or advocate any idea that pandemics produce a positive note to community health. We simply present health benefits from air pollution improvement due to large emission reductions from lowered human and industrial activities. Our results show that continuous efforts to improve air quality are essential to protect public health, especially over city‐clusters with dense population.

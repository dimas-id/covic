Abstract This article presents a novel single-feed circularly polarized patch antenna for dual-band (2.6 and 3.4 GHz) applications. Details of the design procedure and design considerations of the proposed antenna are described. The novelties of the proposed antenna are counted by (i) a meaningful Jia-shaped patch used as the primary radiator; (ii) a 3D L-shaped feeding probe used to excite the stacked patches so that the near degenerate-modes are excited at the desired dual band; (iii) down-tilt beams achieved that are particularly suitable for wall-mount base-stations. The measured 3-dB axial-ratio bandwidths are 2.41-2.61 GHz and 3.25-3.42 GHz, where the maximum gains are recorded as 7.3 and 6.3 dBic, respectively. Methods for the adjustment of band ratio down to 1.18 are discussed. The overall antenna size is 100×100×12.8 mm3.

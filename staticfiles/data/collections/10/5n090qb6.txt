Despite a plethora of publications on the art and science of respiratory care, a number of basic issues remain unanswered. These clinical controversies are often settled by expert opinion and personal bias. By definition, a controversy has compelling arguments for each side of the issue. This Respiratory Care Journal Conference addressed 12 clinical controversies, ranging from spirometry screening for chronic lung disease to the timing of tracheostomy. This paper is a concise synopsis of the salient points of each side of each argument and provides the points of consensus and points of contention. When appropriate, further research is suggested to address still unanswered questions.

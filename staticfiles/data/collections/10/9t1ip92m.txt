The most basic task in proteomics remains the detection and identification of proteins from a biological sample, and the most traditional way to achieve this goal consists in protein separations performed by two‐dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2‐D PAGE). Yet the 2‐D PAGE‐mass spectrometry (MS) approach has its drawbacks with regard to automation, sensitivity, and throughput. Consequently, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of non‐gel‐based proteome separation technologies in an effort to alleviate the shortcomings of 2‐D PAGE. In addition, traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), due to their long period of clinical testing and reliable therapeutic efficacy, are attracting increased global attention. However, hundreds or even thousands of components are usually present in TCMs, which results in great difficulties of separation. As a mainstream separation tool, multidimensional liquid separation systems have shown powerful separation ability, high peak capacity, and excellent detectability in the analysis of complex samples including biological samples and TCMs, etc. Therefore, this review emphasizes the most recent advances in multidimensional liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis‐based separation techniques, and the corresponding applications in proteomics and TCMs. In view of the significant contributions from Chinese scientists, this review focuses mainly on the work of Chinese scientists in the above fields.

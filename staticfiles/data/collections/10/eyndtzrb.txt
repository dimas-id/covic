In a 19-year-old male with interrupted aortic arch and complex congenital heart disease, we report percutaneous repair of a compromised aortic conduit. The patient had aortic arch repair in childhood utilizing a 12 mm Hemashield Dacron conduit. CT angiography showed multiple segments of this conduit were dilated to 16 mm suggesting conduit degeneration and failure with pseudoaneurysm formation. We utilized a self-expanding aortic endograft supported by internal placement of bare metal stents to repair the conduit. Our repair was guided by 3D rotational angiography. This adult patient with complex congenital heart disease and interrupted aortic arch is an example of patients in whom endograft repair of compromised aortic conduits presents a much lower risk alternative than surgical revision.

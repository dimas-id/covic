Postoperative anastomotic leaks and subsequent mediastinal abscess are serious complications. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage after thoracic esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction using a posterior mediastinal route. About 50 of 365 patients (13.7%) with esophageal cancer and postoperative anastomotic leak after curative esophagectomy was investigated. Beginning in June 2009, naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage by inserting a naso-esophageal aspiration tube into the abscess cavity when percutaneous abscess drainage was introduced which was ineffective or technically impossible. Twenty-five patients underwent naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage concomitantly with enteral nutrition. Twenty-one (84%) patients had major leaks, one (4%) minor leak and three (12%) had endoscopically proven conduit necrosis. None of the naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage cases (100%) required reintervention or reoperation and all experienced complete cure (100%) during hospitalization. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed for four patients after discharge because of anastomotic stricture. Patients with leaks were divided into two groups: current group (n = 32), treated after June 2009, and preceding group (n = 18), treated prior to the introduction of naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage. Significantly more patients in the preceding group suffered respiratory failure (28% vs. 61%, p = 0.024), and higher reoperation rate (0% vs. 17%, p = 0.042) and hospital mortality (0% vs. 22%, p = 0.013). In the current group, 31 (97%) patients experienced complete cure during hospitalization. Naso-esophageal extraluminal drainage and concomitant enteral nutritional support are less invasive, and effective and powerful methods to treat even major leakage after esophagectomy. These methods may be an alternative management to improve mortality for patients with esophageal cancer.

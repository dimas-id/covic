PURPOSE To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of primary stenting of the common (CIA) or external iliac artery (EIA) using the Visi-Pro Balloon-Expandable Peripheral Stent System for treatment of stenotic, restenotic, or occluded lesions. METHODS Between 2011 and 2012, 75 patients (mean age 64.2±8.9 years; 46 men) with Rutherford category 2-4 ischemia and atherosclerotic lesions ≤10 cm in length underwent iliac artery stenting at 17 centers in the United States and Europe. The primary outcome of the study was the major adverse event (MAE) rate at 9 months postprocedure [composite of periprocedural death, in-hospital myocardial infarction, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), and amputation of the treated limb]. Secondary outcomes included 30-day MAE rate, 9-month primary patency, changes in ankle-brachial index (ABI) and the Walking Impairment Questionnaire at 30 days and 9 months postprocedure, device success, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization (CD-TVR) at 30 days and 9 months. Outcomes in specific patient cohorts (ie, gender, stent location, calcification severity, and lesion grade) were analyzed. RESULTS Eighty-one stents were implanted in 61 CIA and 15 EIA lesions (41 with moderate/severe calcification). The mean lesion treated length was 29.3±13.9 mm. All devices were successfully deployed. MAE occurred in 3 (4.0%) of 75 subjects at 9 months. Primary patency and freedom from CD-TVR at 9 months were both 95.8%. ABI improved from 0.67±0.14 at baseline to 0.94±0.14 and 0.96±0.16 at 30 days and 9-month follow-up, respectively (p<0.001 for both). There were no differences with respect to any of the analyzed patient characteristics, including gender. CONCLUSION Nine-month results of the VISIBILITY Iliac stent study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01402700) demonstrated safety and effectiveness for the treatment of atherosclerotic CIA and EIA lesions with the Visi-Pro stent across all treated cohorts.

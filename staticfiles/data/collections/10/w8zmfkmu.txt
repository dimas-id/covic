Medical schools around the world have been grappling with how to adapt undergraduate medical curricula in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our institution made the decision to suspend all clinical clerkships the day before the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) recommended to US medical schools a similar suspension of “medical student participation in any activities that involved patient contact.” This manuscript describes the rapid evolution in our decision-making as we weighed various information, values, and priorities in the face of the emerging public health crisis. We discuss how a compromised learning environment and concerns about student, patient, and the public health led to the suspension. We also consider next steps as we move forward in this uncertain time.

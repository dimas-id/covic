BACKGROUND There is a paucity of literature comparing laparoscopic to robotic inguinal hernia repair. We present a single surgeon's transition from laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (L-TEP) to robotic transabdominal preperitoneal (R-TAPP) inguinal hernia repair and compare outcomes from the two approaches. METHODS This retrospective review and analysis of prospectively collected data compare outcomes during the transition from L-TEP to R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon at one institution. Operating times and surgical outcomes and complications are analyzed. All consecutive L-TEP cases from November 2012 to August 2014 and all consecutive R-TAPP cases from March 2013 to October 2015 were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 157 and 118 patients underwent L-TEP and R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair, respectively. The groups were similar regarding demographics and ASA class. A significantly higher number of complex cases were performed in the R-TAPP group compared to L-TEP group (n = 11 vs. n = 1, p = 0.0001). Mean surgical times were nearly identical (69.12 ± 35.13 min, R-TAPP; 69.05 ± 26.31, L-TEP) as were intraoperative and postoperative complication rates-despite the significantly higher number of complex cases in the R-TAPP group. CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study in the literature comparing a single surgeon's experience transitioning from L-TEP to R-TAPP inguinal hernia repair. Results from the R-TAPP cases were similar to those achieved from laparoscopic cases. The robotic platform may have facilitated the execution of complex hernia cases during the proficiency phase.

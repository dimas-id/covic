Half a century has passed since the first orthotopic heart transplant took place. Surgical innovations allowed for heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation to save lives of patients with incurable chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. The complexity of the surgical interventions, chronic host health conditions, and antirejection immunosuppressive medications makes infectious complications common. Infections have remained one of the main barriers for successful transplantation and a source of significant morbidity and mortality. Recognition of infections and its management in this setting require outstanding clinical skills since transplant recipients may not exhibit classic signs or symptoms of disease, and laboratory work has some pitfalls. The prevention, identification, and management of infectious diseases complications in this population are a priority to undertake to improve the medical outcomes of transplantation. Herein, we reviewed the historical aspects, epidemiology, and prophylaxis of infections in heart, lung, and heart-lung transplantation. We also discuss the most prevalent organisms affecting the host and the organ systems involved.

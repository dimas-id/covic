Current literature has documented numerous different presentations of SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19). Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, however, lack of these symptoms does not exclude COVID-19. Given the incomplete understanding of the virus at this time, healthcare professionals must continue to remain informed of the vast number of clinical presentations of the virus to ensure early supportive treatment, ideally leading to improved outcomes.

We identified the binding site of monoclonal antibody 19.2, which cross-neutralizes several mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains, inhibits fusion of MHV-infected cells, and protects against lethal infection (P. J. Talbot and M. J. Buchmeier, Virus Res. 2:317-328, 1985). We used fusion proteins, generated by expression of fragments of the MHV A59 E2 gene in pEX plasmids, and synthetic peptides in a PEPSCAN.

Brazil represents the new epicenter of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), surpassing the mark of more than one million cases and 50,000 deaths. Despite these terrible numbers, experts estimate that the real size of the epidemic may be up to seven times higher (Hallal et al., 2020). Also, Brazilian people with mild symptoms rarely get tested. While the country and world engage in the fight against the pandemic of COVID-19, it remains vital for our health care system to continue caring for all patients.

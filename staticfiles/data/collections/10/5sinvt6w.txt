Blastomycosis is a serious fungal disease of dogs, humans, and occasionally other mammals caused by geographically restricted, thermally dimorphic Blastomyces species. Blastomycosis is primarily a canine disease, with approximately ten dogs diagnosed for every human case. Dogs also develop disease more rapidly, thus becoming sentinels for possible human disease. Human and canine blastomycosis may differ according to epidemiology/epizoology, clinical features, performance and use of diagnostics, and management.

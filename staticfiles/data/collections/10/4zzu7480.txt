Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the infections caused by DNA viruses and also RNA viruses. The chapter focuses on the detection, diagnosis, risk assessment, and decision-making regarding viral infections. Several infections caused by DNA viruses are parvoviruses, rat cytomegalovirus, poxviruses, adenovirus, and papovavirus. Several RNA viruses and infections caused by these viruses are coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, rotavirus and reovirus, and picornaviruses. Monitoring for viral infections should cover at least three venues: animals in established breeding and experimental colonies, animals held in entry quarantine, and animal tissues and products destined for in vivo use. For established colonies, monitoring should be tailored to local conditions. Effective monitoring should encompass sampling on a pre-arranged schedule, which can be intensified if evidence or suspicion of viral infection emerges. Because viral infections of rats can spread insidiously, early detection and epidemiologic “staging” should employ a detection matrix that includes clinical observation, appropriate sampling, and sensitive and specific diagnostic testing.

Abstract Objective The non-translation RNA-microRNA (miRNA) has been demonstrated to correlate to various disease occurrence in body. Serum miRNA was gradually considered as molecular markers for disease diagnosis. This study was designed to analyze differential serum miRNAs level in hormone-induced non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (hormone-NOFH) patients. Methods We selected 30 patients with hormone-NOFH as case group, and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited as control group. miRCURYTM LNA miRNA chip and quantitative RT-PCR were used to examine differential miRNAs expression. Correlation assay was performed between miRNAs and NOFH trait. Results We found that 9 miRNAs were upregulated while 3 miRNAs were downregulated in hormone-TOFH patient serum by result of miRNA chip. QRT-PCR assay revealed that the level of miR-423-5p was significantly increased and miR-10a-5p was significantly decreased. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we observed that miR-423-5p serum level is positive association to FHC levels whereas miR-10a-5p has no association with FHC levels. Furthermore, miR-423-5p is negatively correlated to its downstream molecule-adiponectin. Conclusion We report a miRNA profile of hormone-NOFH and provide a new perspective to understand this intricate disease. This novel information suggests the potential roles of miR-423-5p in the diagnosis, prognosis biomarkers, or therapy targets of hormone-NOFH.

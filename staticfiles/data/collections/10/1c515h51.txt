Glyco3D is a portal for structural glycobiology of several interlinked databases that is covering the three-dimensional features of monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycosyltransferases, lectins, monoclonal antibodies, and glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins. Collection of annotated NMR data of bioactive oligosaccharides is also available. A common nomenclature has been adopted for the structural encoding of the carbohydrates. Each individual database stands by itself as it covers a particular family of either complex carbohydrates or carbohydrate-binding proteins. A unique search engine is available that scans the full content of all the databases for queries related to sequential information of the carbohydrates. The interconnection of these databases provides a unique opportunity to characterize the three-dimensional features that a given oligosaccharide molecule can take in different environments, i.e., vacuum, crystalline state, or interacting with different proteins having different biological function. The databases, which have been manually curated, were developed with nonproprietary software. They are web-based platform and are freely available to the scientific community at http://glyco3d.cermav.cnrs.fr.

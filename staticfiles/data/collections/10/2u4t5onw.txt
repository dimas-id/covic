Last year we started this series of end of year summaries of papers published in the 2014 issues of the Journal Of Clinical Monitoring And Computing with a review on near infrared spectroscopy (Scheeren et al. in J Clin Monit Comput 29(2):217-220, 2015). This year we will broaden the scope and include papers published in the field of tissue oxygenation and microcirculation, or a combination of both entities. We present some promising new technologies that might enable a deeper insight into the (patho)physiology of certain diseases such as sepsis, but also in healthy volunteers. These may help researchers and clinicians to evaluate both tissue oxygenation and microcirculation beyond macro-hemodynamic measurements usually available at the bedside.

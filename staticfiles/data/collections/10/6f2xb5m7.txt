Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education: The pathogenetic mechanism of renal involvement in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is still unclear. It is supposed to result from a combination of several contributing factors, such as state of dehydration, leading to pre-renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, toxic tubular damage, induced by cytokine storm or rhabdomyolysis, cytopathic action induced by the virus that invades ACE2- expressing kidney cells and drug-induced nephrotoxicity.

In this issue, Joensen and colleagues present the first data we have seen on the impact and experience of diabetes through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was completed in Denmark in March 2020, in the context of a marked shutdown of economic and social activities across the country, but without the devastating death tolls experienced by other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. There are several notable findings, which have global relevance, and we should take the time to reflect on these for our own localized contexts.

OBJECTIVE Absorbable staples facilitate detubularization and reconfiguration of the bowel when performing augmentation colocystoplasty. We compared the outcomes of stapled sigmoid augmentation with standard sutured colocystoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2011, 108 children underwent bladder augmentation at our institution. Colocystoplasty was used in 30 patients (27.8%). Medical charts of children who underwent stapled (n = 8) or sutured (n = 22) sigmoid augmentation were compared with regard to patient demographics and surgical complications, including anastomotic leak and urolithiasis. RESULTS Eight children with underwent stapled sigmoid colocystoplasty. Average age at surgery was 8 years (range 4-17 years). Time to detubularize and refashion the bowel segment prior to augmentation was consistently under 5 min. Average length of follow-up was 44 months (range 12-80 months). One patient experienced anastomotic leak. Two of eight children (25%) in the stapled anastomosis cohort developed bladder stones. Twenty-two patients underwent standard sigmoid augmentation during the same time period (average age 8.2 years; range 4-16 years). One of 22 (4.5%) experienced anastomotic leak. Seven of 22 (31.8%) developed cystolithiasis. CONCLUSIONS Complications from stapled sigmoid anastomosis are similar to those from standard colocystoplasty. Use of absorbable staples decreases operating time by avoiding bowel spatulation and suturing, and should be considered in pediatric patients undergoing colocystoplasty.

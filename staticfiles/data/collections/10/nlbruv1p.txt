Given the COVID-19 outbreak, these unprecedented times pose many urgent dilemmas about how to support the mental health of communities. The goal of this research is to summarize existing literature on the mental health impact of the recent Flint Water Crisis. In March 2020, we searched five databases for literature exploring the psychological consequences of the crisis. Main findings were extracted. 132 citations were screened and eleven included in the review. Results suggest a negative psychological effect caused by the water crisis, including anxiety and health worries, exacerbated by lowered trust in public health officials, uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the crisis, financial hardships, stigma, and difficulties seeking help. There was evidence that concerns about tap water continued even after the state of emergency was lifted. With a possible compounded effect to residents of Flint with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the results highlight the need for more resources for psychological health interventions in Flint as well as a need for local governments and health authorities to regain the trust of those affected by the Flint Water Crisis.

The COVID-19 pandemic has foisted unprecedented changes upon graduate medical education ranging from adjustments to patient care practices to adaptive modifications to educational activities. To comply with social distancing guidelines, in-person conferences and didactics have been suspended in most, if not all residency programs throughout the country. Many programs, however, have transitioned to live virtual platforms such as Zoom to continue educational activities. While live virtual learning has allowed for continued education, it presents its unique challenges. The impersonal nature of the virtual learning environment creates a propensity for detachment and disengagement. While the video function is turned off and the microphone is muted, a participant can completely disengage from virtual learning while still appearing to be present.

In the absence of any proper clinical solution, human civilization is only left with sophisticated intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. However, the existing models to estimate the intervention does not take into account the realistic connectivity of the epicentres of the pandemic. We generalise our earlier model of interacting hotspots to test various possibilities of intervention in a model state consisting of multiple epicentres. We also analyse situations when the hotspots are spatially correlated and the interaction is limited to population exchanges with the nearest neighbours. We show that the heterogeneity in the infection propagation is solely dependent on the protocol of the containment and its strength. We explore many such situations and discuss possibilities.

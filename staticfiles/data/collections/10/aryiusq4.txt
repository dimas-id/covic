We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as $50\times$, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate $R(t)$ is $0.20$. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing.

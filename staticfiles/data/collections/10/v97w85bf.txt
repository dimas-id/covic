The results of the in vitro studies on the efficacy of medical nonspecific protective agents from various pharmacological groups showed that some drugs, such as velferon, alferon, betaferon, ribavirin and lopinavir were active against TOPC virus, that permitted to recommend them for estimation of their activity on laboratory animals. The data on the in vivo activity of pharmacological drugs with respect to TOPC virus are rather scanty and it is difficult to predetermine their efficacy. The danger of TOPC virus latent circulation among wild animals in China requires research of new efficient medical agents for protection of the people from the pathogen in the Russian Federation.

Both humans and chimpanzees have better performances when recognizing faces or bodies when the stimuli are upright compared to inverted. This is called the inversion effect. It suggests that these two species use a specific way to process faces and bodies. Previous research has suggested that humans also show the inversion effect to objects that they have expertise about, and this is called the expert effect. We investigated whether chimpanzees show the expert effect and how humans and chimpanzees differ by testing chimpanzees (human experts) with human body stimuli and testing humans (chimpanzee experts) with chimpanzee and human body stimuli in body recognition tasks. The main finding was that humans (chimpanzee experts) showed the expert effect to chimpanzee bodies, while chimpanzees partially showed it to human bodies. This suggests that compared with chimpanzees, the special processing in humans can be more flexibly tuned for other objects. We also tested humans that were not chimpanzee experts using chimpanzee body stimuli. Although they showed similar performances as the chimpanzee experts, the two groups had differences in some situations, indicating the effect of expertise. This study revealed the important role of experience in object processing in humans, and our evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees.

Human saliva is an inquisitively complex fluid and has an imperative role for prevention and protection from viral infection, particularly through innate immune system, which is a prominent first-line defense against viral infection (Malamud et al., 2011; Dawes et al., 2015). Despite the clear role of saliva in the continuous cleansing of oral cavity, we focus on proteins that illustrate antiviral activity, particularly against corona viruses.

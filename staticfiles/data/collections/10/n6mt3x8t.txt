Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is one of the great milestones in the field of gastroenterology. It is versatile in image acquisition, painless and can reach parts of the small bowel not amenable to conventional endoscopy. The commonest complication with WCE is retention of the capsule. We report a case of retained capsule in a child who was being investigated for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). Operative intervention was required for its retrieval after two weeks of expectant management.

In a survey which lasted one year and included data of 73 dairy cows with their calves, colostrum immunoglobulin G (IgG) of 22 primiparous cows and serum IgG of their calves were lower than the corresponding IgG levels of 51 multiparous cows and their calves. Serum IgG concentration was not correlated with diarrhoea incidence. Although there were no seasonal differences in the IgG concentration of colostrum and calf serum, neonatal diarrhoea incidence was higher in calves which were born in winter than in calves which were born in summer (P < 0.01). Thus the high diarrhoea incidence in winter was not a consequence of an insufficient IgG transfer to the calves. The 60 calves of the second study were fed colostrum on the first day of life. From the second to the tenth day 28 experimental calves received milk and 0.5 l of surplus colostrum of the first and second milking twice a day, whereas 32 control calves received milk only twice a day. Two of the 28 experimental and 11 of the 32 control calves suffered from diarrhoea during the first ten days of life (P < 0.05). These results show that the ingestion of surplus colostrum in addition to milk after the first day of life protects the new-born calf against infectious diarrhoea.

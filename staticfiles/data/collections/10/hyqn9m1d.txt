SIMPLE SUMMARY: The high adaptation and recombination abilities of infectious bronchitis virus (IB) have been proven. This study aims to verify the genetic and antigenic variation of eight field IB strains regarding the 4/91 strain vaccination in Chilean chickens. Phylogenetic, serologic and challenge studies were carried out to accomplish this goal. The genetic analyses indicate that all the viruses isolated prior to the 4/91 introduction belong to the genetic group GI-16 (three isolates from 2009). On the other hand, just one of the viruses isolated after the 4/91 strain vaccine introduction in Chile (in 2015) showed relationship with GI-16 lineage. The remaining four viruses (from 2017) belong to GI-13, the group where the strain 4/91 has been previously classified. Three viruses were chosen to perform antigenic and protective studies. Antigenically, the high relationship between the 4/91 vaccine with the isolate from 2017 is remarkable and could not be observed with isolates from 2009 and 2015. The 4/91 vaccine also showed better protection against the isolate from 2017 than isolates from 2009 and 2015. These results suggest that the introduction of the 4/91 vaccine in Chile could imply a change in some viruses, showing its ability to interact with field viruses, so it is important to monitor the circulating viruses and include these results in future governmental decisions. ABSTRACT: The introduction of the 4/91 vaccine against infectious bronchitis in Chile, a lineage not described until that time in the country, led to looking for changes induced by this action. This study considers eight isolates obtained from 2009, 2015 and 2017 and uses a maximum likelihood approach to classify the field isolates. Three isolates were selected to analyze antigenic relationships through a virus neutralization test and to perform protection tests measured trough an RT-qPCR. The isolates from 2009 and 2015 showed a relationship with GI-16 while those from 2017 were related to GI-13. Though the field isolates were classified in two different phylogenetic lineages, all of them showed only minor variations in subtype. The 13885R-17 isolate from 2017 exhibited high antigenic relatedness to the 4/91 vaccine. As expected, 4/91 and Massachusetts vaccines were not antigenically related. Vaccinated birds with the 4/91 vaccine showed less tracheal virus replication for the 13885R-17 from 2017 challenge than for the 12101SP-09 from 2009 and 13347SP-15 from 2015 isolates. The results indicated genetic and antigenic diversity in the most recent infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates in Chile. Moreover, the 4/91 vaccine would be involved in the generation of some current field viruses, which must be considered in vaccination programs and public policies.

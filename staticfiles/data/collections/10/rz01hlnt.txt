On 22 January, Dave O’Connor and Tom Friedrich invited several dozen colleagues around the United States to join a new workspace on the instant messaging platform Slack The scientists, both at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, had seen news about a new disease emerging in China and realized researchers would need a primate model if they were going to answer some important questions about its biology “We put out a call to a bunch of investigators and basically said: ‘Hey, let’s talk,’” O’Connor says The idea is to coordinate research and make sure results are comparable, Friedrich adds (They named the Slack workspace the Wu-han Clan, a play on the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan ) The Wu-han Clan is just one example of how the COVID-19 outbreak is transforming how scientists communicate about fast-moving health crises A torrent of data is being released daily by preprint servers that didn’t even exist a decade ago, then dissected on platforms such as Slack and Twitter, and in the media, before formal peer review begins Journal staffers are working overtime to get manuscripts reviewed, edited, and published at record speeds The venerable New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) posted one COVID-19 paper within 48 hours of submission Viral genomes posted on a platform named GISAID, more than 200 so far, are analyzed instantaneously by a phalanx of evolutionary biologists who share their phylogenetic trees in preprints and on social media

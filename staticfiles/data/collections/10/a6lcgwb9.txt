Even in ideal circumstances, the performance of safe and effective endoscopic transsphenoidal pituitary surgery requires complicated orchestration of care amongst multiple medical and surgical teams in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings. The current COVID-19 pandemic further complicates this highly orchestrated effort. Healthcare systems around the globe are working to adapt to the rapidly changing healthcare landscape as information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus is discovered and disseminated. The nature of the transsphenoidal corridor exposes the pituitary surgery team to increased risk of virus exposure.

This chapter considers the creation and growth of professional sport leagues throughout East Asia. In this, the different leagues and sport are examined, and noted for their hybrid use of both North American and European methods of business and regulation of sport leagues. Notably, prominent Japanese, Chinese, South Korean, and Taiwanese sport organizations are covered in their emergence as the top sport businesses within the region. The creation of these leagues varies from the old (Japanese baseball) to the new (Chinese football). As the dynamics of political and economic power has shifted in East Asia in the last several decades, so has the popularity and importance of many of the sport leagues in the region. At the same time, as these leagues have grown, many of the top stars have begun to leave for more popular and competitive leagues in North America and Europe. This chapter concludes in considering the future potential of sport leagues in Asia, and whether the teams and leagues will be able to continue to survive in their current formats.

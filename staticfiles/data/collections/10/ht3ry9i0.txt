Bioactive peptides cleaved from the egg-laying hormone precursor in the bag cell neurons of Aplysia are sorted into distinct dense core vesicle classes (DCVs). Bag cell prohormone processing can be divided into two stages, an initial cleavage occurring in a late Golgi compartment, which is not blocked by monensin, and later cleavages that occur within DCVs and are blocked by monensin. Prohormone intermediates are sorted in the trans-Golgi network. The large soma-specific DCVs turn over, while the small DCVs are transported to processes for regulated release. Thus, protein trafficking differentially regulates the levels and localization of multiple biologically active peptides derived from a common prohormone.

The vaccinia virus (VV) 39-kDa protein, the product of the A4L gene, is a highly antigenic protein of the viral core. Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that the 39-kDa protein interacts with p4a (encoded by the A10L gene), the precursor of the most abundant virion protein. This interaction is maintained with the processed 4a form that arises during virion maturation. The controlled disruption of mature viral particles showed that the 39-kDa and 4a proteins are tightly bound within the virion. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that both proteins first localize within the cytoplasm and later accumulate inside the viral factories, reaching these locations via a mechanism apparently unrelated to cellular membranes. Double labeling experiments showed a colocalization of both proteins in all virus-induced structures.

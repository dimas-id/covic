BACKGROUND: Although 0.8 mg/kg is considered a lethal dose of colchicine, fatal cases of patients who followed a critical disease course after an intake below this lethal dose have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old Japanese woman who had taken an overdose of prescription colchicine (15 mg; 0.2 mg/kg) was brought to our emergency out-patient department. Although her colchicine intake was below 0.8 mg/kg (considered the lethal dose), she reached a critical state and underwent three phases characterizing colchicine poisoning (gastrointestinal symptoms, multiple organ failure, and recovery). Her condition was critical, with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of a maximum of 14. CONCLUSIONS: Patients might reach a critical stage after colchicine ingestion at a non-lethal dose. Thus, it might be necessary to review which dose of colchicine should be considered lethal.

The objective of this investigation was to determine the distribution of Bredavirus in cattle herds in Lower Saxony and to evaluate its significance as potential cause of diarrhea in calves. Fecal samples and paired blood samples of 119 diarrheic and 46 healthy calves up to two months of age were collected from herds where diarrhea of calves was a problem. Fecal samples were examined for Breda-, rota- and coronavirus by solid phase immune electron microscopy and by ELISA, for K99-positive E. coli and salmonella by microbiological methods, and for cryptosporidia in smears. Antibody titers against Bredavirus, total serum protein and serum gamma globulin content were evaluated in the blood samples. Bredavirus was found in fecal samples from 5% (n = 6) of diarrheic calves which came from four different herds, but not in healthy calves. Rotavirus (31.9%), coronavirus (18.5%) and cryptosporidia (29.9%) were detected more frequently in fecal samples than Bredavirus. In this investigation rotavirus, coronavirus and cryptosporidia were present in addition in all herds where Bredavirus was found. In contrast to the low percentage of fecal samples containing Bredavirus, antibody titers in 75% of calves confirmed the high prevalence of Bredavirus infection in the cattle population of Lower Saxony.

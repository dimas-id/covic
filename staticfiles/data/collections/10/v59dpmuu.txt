SARS-CoV-2 is the agent responsible for COVID-19. The infection can be dived into three phases: mild infection, the pulmonary phase and the inflammatory phase. Treatment options for the pulmonary phase include: Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The inflammatory phase includes therapeutic options like Tocilizumab, Anakinra, Baricitinib, Eculizumab, Emapalumab and Heparin. Human clinical trials are starting to show some results, in some cases like that of Remdesivir these are controversial. Coagulopathy is a common complication in severe cases, inflammation and coagulation are intertwined and cross-talking between these two responses is known to happen. A possible amplification of this cross-talking is suggested to be implicated in the severe cases that show both a cytokine storm and coagulopathy.

Mycotic aneurysms, which may occur anywhere in the body, may be prone to spontaneous rupture. Antibiotic therapy combined with surgical debridement without or with revascularization has been described as potential treatment options. This report describes a combined balloon occlusion technique with the injection of ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer for the treatment of a mycotic aneurysm of the pulmonary artery secondary to infective endocarditis. Similar techniques have been described in the cerebral circulation and may obviate concerns for coil erosion, non-target embolization, or superinfection.

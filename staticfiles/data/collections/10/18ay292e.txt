Embolic protection devices were initially developed for use in the treatment of saphenous vein aortocoronary bypass graft stenosis as well as in carotid artery stenting because of the significant risk of atheroembolism and their use is well accepted. The use of these devices for lower-extremity arterial interventions is becoming well accepted because of the significant consequences of embolization in patients with limited circulatory runoff. This is especially true in the use of mechanical atherectomy devices for femoropopliteal arterial lesions.

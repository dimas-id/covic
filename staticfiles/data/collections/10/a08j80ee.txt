The two dimensional molecular tagging velocimetry (2D-MTV) has been used to measure velocity fields of the flow in a micro mixer. Instead of commonly used micro particles an optical tagging of the flow has been performed by using a caged dye. The pattern generation is done by imaging a mask for the first time. This allows to generate nearly any imaginable pattern. The flow induces a deformation of the optically written pattern that can be tracked by laser induced fluorescence. The series of raw images acquired in this way were analyzed quantitatively with a novel optical flow based technique. The reference measurements have been carried out allowing to draw conclusions about the accuracy of this procedure. A comparison to the standard technique of Î¼PIV has also been conducted. Apart from measuring flow velocities in microfluidic mixing processes, the spatial distribution of concentration fields for different species has also been measured. To this end, a new technique has been developed that allows spatial measurements from Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering (PSRS). The Raman stray light of the relevant species has been spectrally selected by a narrow bandpass filter and thus detected unaffectedly by the Raman stray light of other species. The successful operation of this measurement procedure in micro flows will be demonstrated exemplary for a mixing process of water and ethanol.

INTRODUCTION Traumatic intracranial aneurysms in children are rare and may occur as the result of closed or penetrating head trauma. Their natural history seems to be more aggressive. Most traumatic aneurysms have complex shape, tending to have a large neck or even a fusiform morphology. CASE REPORT We present a case of a traumatic carotid artery aneurysm in a 9-year-old girl that was successfully treated with pipeline embolization device. DISCUSSION Due to its dissecting nature, wall friability and lack of a substantial neck can make surgical clipping and selective coiling difficult and risky. Although endovascular parent artery occlusion is the best approach in the acute phase, in some situations it is not possible or very risky. In such scenario the use of flow diverter devices would be an alternative approach. Additionally, we discuss the potential advantages and risks of flow diverter deployment inside a developing vessel.

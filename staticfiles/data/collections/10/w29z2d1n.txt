Yang and colleagues published the relevance of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients and its association with mortality in this condition in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.1 The authors are to be applauded for the largest so-far analysis in the epidemiology of thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. In addition to the association with mortality, there may be several other findings in this interesting paper which deserves mention. First of all, the study confirms that COVID-19 is not associated with significant thrombocytopenia (only 20.7% had counts less than 125 x 109/L, the lower range in this study).2,3 The 'higher' platelet counts for an illness as severe as COVID-19 is unusual and likely points towards liver activation and thrombopoietin release.

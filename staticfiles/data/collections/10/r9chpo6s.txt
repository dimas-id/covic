OBJECTIVES To compare monopolar and bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (M-TURP and B-TURP, respectively) focusing on erectile and ejaculatory functions in a randomized trial. METHODS Between January 2013 and December 2014, all consecutive TURP candidates with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were prospectively randomized 1:1 into M-TURP/B-TURP arms and followed up at 2, and 4 weeks, 6 and 12 months after surgery. All patients were assessed using IIEF-15 (International index of erectile function-15) and Ej-MSHQ (ejaculatory domain-male sexual-health inventory). Changes in IIEF-15, its subdomains and Ej-MSHQ scores were compared between both intervention groups. RESULTS Following M.TURP and B.TURP; 122 and 124 patients were included respectively and were considered for analysis at 1 year. Sexual function did not differ significantly between arms during follow-up (erectile function, P = 0.82; orgasmic function, P = 0.46; sexual desire, P = 0.29; intercourse satisfaction, P = 0.18; overall satisfaction, P = 0.92). There were no differences between arms in the distribution of EF evolution at any time compared with base line (at 12 months: M-TURP vs. B-TURP = improved, 24.5 vs. 26.6%; stable, 66.4 vs. 64.5%; deteriorated, 9.1 vs. 8.9%; P = 0.41). Newly developed erectile dysfunction (ED) was present in 8.2 and 7.3% of patients following M.TURP and B.TURP respectively and was related to presence of DM and obesity. Orgasm perception significantly reduced following M.TURP and B.TURP (P < 0.001). Newly reported ejaculatory dysfunction (Ej-MSHQ < 22) was significantly associated with low orgasm perception. CONCLUSIONS There were no differences between M-TURP/B-TURP in any aspect of sexual function.

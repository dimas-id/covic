OBJECTIVES To describe our single-port experience in gynecologic oncology surgery, and emphasize the feasibility to use the single-port in this surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS It is a retrospective, feasibility study, monocentric. All patients who were operated by the single-port, between 1st January 2010 to 1st November 2011, were included. RESULTS We note that 107 patients were included. We made different interventions: uni- and bilateral salpingo-ovariectomy, hysterectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy in gynecologic malignancies. The median age of the population and the body mass index were respectively 52 and 22.6 kg/m(2). In total, six interventions will be converted. The median hospital stay of patients, all procedures combined, was 2 days. We find low rate of postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Gynecological cancer surgery appears feasible for single-port. However, we need other studies to confirm a benefit of using the single-port compared to conventional laparoscopy.

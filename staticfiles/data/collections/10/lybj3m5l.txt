Sweat accumulation underneath surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes is a common problem in workplace studies which compromises electrode adherence to the skin as well as signal fidelity. In this study, the effect of sweat accumulation on signal amplitude and mean frequency (MF) was examined to determine if the sEMG signal becomes altered through the sweat layer and whether this effect can be avoided by interrupting the pool of sweat using a thin strip of medical adhesive between the electrode snaps. Nine males performed a maximum, isometric contraction of their right quadriceps as sEMG was collected. Skin conditions under the electrode were dry and wet in incremental layers of 0.02 mm of artificial sweat. The results demonstrated that sweat accumulation under sEMG electrodes dampens the amplitude of the EMG signal in a predictable way (r = .88 and .97 for double and single snap electrodes, respectively) with almost 2% and 3% deterioration for every 0.02 mm of sweat depending on the type of electrode used. The medical adhesive proved to be highly effective at preventing amplitude deterioration indicating that signal shunting can be prevented. MF was not influenced by sweat accumulation even under the extreme wet condition.

In patients with history of coronary artery disease angina pectoris is usually attributed to the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. However, in patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG) using internal mammary artery grafts, great vessel disease should also be considered. Herein we present two patients with history of CABG whose symptoms were suspicious for coronary ischemia. During cardiac catheterization reverse blood flow was observed from the left artery disease to the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft in both cases. After angioplasty and stent implantation of the left subclavian artery antegrade flow was restored in the LIMA grafts and both patients had complete resolution of symptoms.

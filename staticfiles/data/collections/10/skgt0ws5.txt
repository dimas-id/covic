Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reminds us that sudden disease emergence is a permanent part of our world--and should be anticipated in our planning. Historically the emergence of new diseases has had little or no impact beyond a small, localized cluster of infections. However, given just the right conditions, a highly virulent pathogen can suddenly spread across time and space with massive consequences, as has occurred on several occasions in human history. In the wake of the SARS outbreak, we are now forced to confront the unpleasant fact that human activities are increasing the frequency and severity of these kinds of emergences. The idea of more frequent biological "invasions" with economic and societal impacts comparable to SARS, presents stakeholders in and the global economy with unprecedented new risks, challenges and even opportunities. As a major contributor to economic stability, the insurance industry must follow these trends very closely and develop scenarios to anticipate these events.

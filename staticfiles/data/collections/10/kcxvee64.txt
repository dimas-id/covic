Retrorectal tumors are an uncommon pathological entity. Their clinical importance arises from their occasional malignant nature or malignant transformation. The treatment of choice for most presacral tumors is surgical excision. The approach depends upon the upper limit of the lesion and the presumptive pathology. We reviewed the main features of these tumors with emphasis on transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) as a viable surgical approach for the treatment of the lesions, undertaken in our institution. We present our small case series, consisting of six patients with retrorectal lesions who underwent local excision via TEM. Early and late postoperative outcomes are presented. TEM for retrorectal lesions appears to be a feasible and safe approach. A remarkably low morbidity favors TEM in selected patients.

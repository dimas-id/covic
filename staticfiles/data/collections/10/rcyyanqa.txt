The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary strain on healthcare systems across North America. Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically-ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is well-suited to answer questions at bedside. A multi-disciplinary group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE representing intensive care, critical care cardiology and emergency medicine from the United States and Canada, convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aimed to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. Among other critical care applications, TEE can allow hemodynamic assessment of patients during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs during recruitment maneuvers, guide cardiac arrest resuscitation, and facilitate veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic, we describe a set of principles and practical aspects for performing examinations with a focus on the logistics, personnel, equipment required before, during, and after an examination. In the right clinical scenario, TEE is a tool that can provide the information needed to deliver the best and safest possible care for the critically ill patient.

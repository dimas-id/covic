Successful recovery of RNA viruses and functional RNA replicons from cDNA has greatly facilitated molecular genetic analyses of viral proteins and cis-regulatory elements. This technology allows the use of RNA virus replication machinery to express heterologous sequences. Both positive-strand and negative-strand animal RNA viruses have been engineered to produce chimeric viruses expressing protective epitopes from other pathogens and for transient expression of heterologous sequences.

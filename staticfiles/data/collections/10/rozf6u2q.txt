It also reviews the expected hematologic changes in a variety of species-specific disease processes as well as the correlation with other clinicopathologic parameters. The second part of this chapter pertains to the interpretation of serum biochemical data with respect to reference intervals and preanalytical, analytical, and biologic variables. Similarities and differences between species are elucidated. Brief discussions regarding methods of analysis for some analytes are included where methodology may impact test interpretation.

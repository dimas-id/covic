The HIV/AIDS-related policy framework in China has come a long way from initially attempting to prevent HIV from entering the country in the early stages of the epidemic to facilitating comprehensive national HIV response of today. Each step of the way, policymakers in China have strived to ensure that HIV-related policies were pragmatic, tailored to the Chinese context, aligned with international best practices, and based upon the best available information at the time. Although there have been a great many policy actions since HIV was first discovered on the mainland, a few key policies were foundational, had a major impact on the epidemic, and marked an important shift China’s HIV response, for example, the Blood Donation Law (1998), the first Five-Year Action Plan for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2001), and the “Four Frees and One Care” policy (2003). These and other key policies are highlighted here. Going forward, as China’s HIV epidemic increases in size and complexity, policymakers need to remain grounded in evidence but also be open to alternative and innovative approaches.

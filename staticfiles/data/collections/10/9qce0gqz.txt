Before Florence Nightingale, nurses lacked special skills and training. The nursing mainly relied on nurse's religious passion and feelings to carry out nursing activities, and some vulgar and ignorant women took care of the job. Nightingale, who well-educated, born in an aristocratic family, devoted herself to nursing career despite the opposition of her family. She travelled around the world to investigate the hospital and nursing status. Nightingale practiced her concept of nursing work in the Crimean war. After the investigation of the wounded soldiers, she pointed out that the high mortality rate of British soldiers was related to poor nursing. She put forward suggestions to strengthen military nursing education; then she established modern nursing education institutions and created a new nursing education model, which was the beginning of modern nursing career.

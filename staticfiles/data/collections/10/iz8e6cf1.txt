COVID-19 cases are alarmingly increasing in Pakistan since May 2020. Laboratory based surveillance system has been in place since the start of the pandemic. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated locally has been conducted based on partial ORF1b. The sequences were classified to show the phylogenetic correlation and showed 100% homology with those detected in neighboring countries India and China. The rapid increase in cases has led to development of robust strategies to enhance the laboratory testing capacity. We are currently meeting the country requirement to diagnose the virus in the community. Nonetheless, factors like recent ease in lockdown measures has led to massive rise in number of cases in few weeks time.

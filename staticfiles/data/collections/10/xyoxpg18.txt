A new oxygen-scavenging additive masterbatch has been added to Clariant's Mevopur range of medical-grade materials for pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices. According to the company, Mevopur ProTect provides effective protection against oxygen (O2) degradation for drugs and nutraceuticals stored in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, even in a transparent monolayer construction, thereby ensuring the requisite shelf-life for such products. The new masterbatch concentrate was introduced at the Paris Pharmapack Europe event in February.

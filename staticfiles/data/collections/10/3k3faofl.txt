OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of abnormal findings on evaluation of neonates with congenital CMV infection who have a normal physical examination STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, 2-center study (1996–2017) that reviewed results of complete blood cell count and platelets, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin concentrations, eye examination, cranial ultrasonography or other neuroimaging, and brainstem evoked responses performed on neonates with congenital CMV infection and a normal physical examination RESULTS: Of 34 infants with congenital CMV infection and a normal physical examination, 56% (19/34) had ≥1 abnormality: 39%, elevated ALT concentration; 45%, abnormal neuroimaging (five, lenticulostriate vasculopathy; six, intraventricular hemorrhage; four, calcifications); 12%, anemia; 16%, thrombocytopenia; and 3%, chorioretinitis. Seven (21%) infants had sensorineural hearing loss, and 18 infants received antiviral therapy. CONCLUSION: Some infants with congenital CMV infection and a normal physical examination had abnormalities on laboratory or neuroimaging evaluation, which in some cases prompted antiviral treatment.

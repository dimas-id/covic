Little is known about viral and atypical bacteria pathogen spectra of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection in children in Tunisia. Thus, a prospective study was carried out between January 2009 and March 2010 in Sfax. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from 368 patients (78 with pneumonia and 290 with acute bronchiolitis) were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and PCR to detect influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, human enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, Mycoplasma pneumonia (Mpn) and Chlamydia pneumonia (Cpn). One or more etiology was documented in 319 cases (86.7%). The most detected viruses were RSV (42.7%), rhinovirus (32.9%) and adenovirus (28.5%). Co-detection of two or three pathogens was found in 40% of positive samples. This study highlights the importance of respiratory viruses in lower respiratory tract infection in children of Sfax region as well as the high rate of co-detection of multiple viruses, resulting in challenges in clinical interpretation.

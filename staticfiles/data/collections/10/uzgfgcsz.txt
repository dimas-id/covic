BACKGROUND The delta-shaped anastomotic technique (Delta-SA) has been accepted as a standard reconstruction method in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction (TLDG B-I). However, some anastomosis-related surgical complications have been reported. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of modified Delta-SA, called intracorporeal triangular anastomotic technique (INTACT), in this study. METHODS From January 2010 to May 2018, we identified patients who underwent TLDG B-I with INTACT (n = 289) and Delta-SA (n = 221). Using one-to-one propensity score matching, surgical outcomes and gastrointestinal function were compared between the two groups. RESULTS After one-to-one propensity score matching, 177 pairs of INTACT and Delta-SA patients were selected. Patient background was closely balanced between the two groups. Operative time (186 [159, 213] min vs. 237 [213, 264] min; P < 0.001), estimated blood loss (0 [0, 10] g vs. 20 [0, 50] g; P < 0.001), and postoperative hospital stay (7 [7, 9] days vs. 10 [9, 13] days; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the INTACT group than in Delta-SA group. There were no patients with postoperative leakage in the INTACT group and three patients in the Delta group (0.0% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.041). Endoscopic food residue grade â‰¥ 3 based on the Residue, Gastritis, Bile classification system at 1 year after surgery was observed in 14 patients in the INTACT group and 30 patients in the Delta group (9.6% vs. 17.0%; P = 0.052). CONCLUSION INTACT in TLDG B-I is safe and feasible for gastric cancer. Given its acceptable surgical outcomes, this alternative reconstruction method can be an option with TLDG B-I.

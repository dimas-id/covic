Virus-like particles (VLPs) can be spontaneously formed after expression of self-polymerising viral capsid proteins. VLPs structurally resemble their native source virus, maintaining immunological relevance by retaining formation of immunogenic motifs with natural conformation. The absence of the virus genome renders VLPs safe for administration as a subunit vaccine. VLPs can target both arms of the immune response, with some VLPs initiating production of specific antibodies and others activating cytotoxic T cells. VLPs are also exceptionally versatile, conferring protection against the host virus or acting as a scaffold for antigenic molecules. In addition, VLP can support intraparticulate encapsulation for immunomodulation and gene delivery. VLP vaccines have been developed for prophylactic protection against infectious organisms, and therapeutic treatment of conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, hypertension, and cancer. With an expanding list of vaccine candidates, VLP vaccines are a promising field with a wide range of applications.

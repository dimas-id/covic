BACKGROUND. The impaired balance of the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio obtained from spectral components of RR intervals can be a diagnostic test for sepsis. In addition, it is known that a reduction of heart rate variability (HRV) is useful in identifying septic patients at risk of the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). We have reported a non-contact method using a microwave radar to monitor the heart and respiratory rates of a healthy person placed inside an isolator or of experimental animals exposed to toxic materials. APPARATUS DESIGN AND TESTING. With the purpose of preventing secondary exposure of medical personnel to toxic materials under biochemical hazard conditions, we designed a novel apparatus for non-contact measurement of HRV using a 1215 MHz microwave radar, a high-pass filter, and a personal computer. The microwave radar monitors only the small reflected waves from the subject's chest wall, which are modulated by the cardiac and respiratory motion. The high-pass filter enhances the cardiac signal and attenuates the respiratory signal. In a human trial, RR intervals derived from the non-contact apparatus significantly correlated with those derived from ECG (r=0.98, P<0.0001). The non-contact apparatus showed a similar power spectrum of RR intervals to that of ECG. CONCLUSIONS. Our non-contact HRV measurement apparatus appears promising for future pre-hospital monitoring of septic patients or for predicting MODS patients, inside isolators or in the field for mass casualties under biochemical hazard circumstances.

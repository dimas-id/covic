We present a case of multiple interventions to treat symptomatic stenosis of the superior vena cava in a child, with end-stage renal disease and a history of long-term hemodialysis, who had required indwelling central venous catheters for several years. The stenosis was successfully treated with an Edwards Valeo Lifestent, but recurrent symptomatic superior vena caval stenosis developed within 5 months, requiring repeat catheterization and stent placement.

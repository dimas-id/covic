This paper describes the global distribution and temporal trend of Varroa spp. during 13 years (2005-2018) using the information retrieved from the OIE World Animal Health Information Database (WAHIS). During the period of study 53.4% of the countries reported the presence of the mite at least once. Countries were classified in five categories: 22% as Enzootic, 18% as Epizootic, 9% as Free, 12% and 26% respectively as disease Present or Absent at least once since 2005. Twelve percent of the countries were not able to provide any information on the presence of the disease. The average percentage of countries reporting the disease present was stable along the study, but it was observed a statistically significant increasing trend in the number of outbreaks reported per year. The number of outbreaks were different among the climate regions. Based on the seasonality analysis, the second semester of each year was the period characterized by the highest number of outbreaks reported.

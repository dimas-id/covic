Viridans streptococci (VGS) form a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of species belonging to the genus Streptococcus (1). However, they have some common phenotypic properties. They are alfa- or non-haemolytic. They can be differentiated from S. pneumoniae by resistance to optochin and the lack of bile solubility (2). They can be differentiated from the Enterococcus species by their inability to grow in a medium containing 6.5% sodium chloride (2). Earlier, so-called nutritionally variant streptococci were included in the VGS but based on the molecular data they have now been removed to a new genus Abiotrophia (3) and are not included in the discussion below. VGS belong to the normal microbiota of the oral cavities and upper respiratory tracts of humans and animals. They can also be isolated from the female genital tract and all regions of the gastrointestinal tract (2, 3). Several species are included in VGS and are listed elsewhere (2, 3). Clinically the most important species belonging to the VGS are S. mitis, S. sanguis and S. oralis.

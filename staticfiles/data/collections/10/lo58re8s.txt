The scale of the COVID‐19 pandemic is entirely unprecedented. However, as depicted in Fig. 1, evidence from previous large‐scale disasters indicates that following a first wave of admissions and deaths from COVID‐19, there are likely to be subsequent waves of people with acute care needs worsened by delayed hospital treatment, and people with long‐term conditions whose routine care has been disrupted [1]. People with diabetes are likely to constitute a large proportion of those with acute second‐ and third‐wave care needs, and in many cases, management of their condition may also have been negatively affected by lockdown.

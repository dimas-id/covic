The existence of a widely spread corona virus epidemic enabled us to associate this infection with necrotizing hemorrhagic enterocolitis in newborn infants. Virus is detected in the stools by direct electron microscopic examination. Virions are found agglutinated in the gut during convalescence, as they are by circulating antibodies. Arguments supporting a possible etiological role of this infection are given.

The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) spike glycoprotein S1 subunit is required to initiate infection and contains virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitope(s). Reported are the S1 gene nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for the Florida 18288 strain and isolates GA-92, CV-56b, CV-9437, CV-1686, and 1013. These sequences were compared with previously published gene sequences of IBV strains, and phylogenetic relationships are reported. The S1 amino acid sequence of Florida 18288 was 94.9% similar to the Connecticut strain, and GA-92 was 92.8% similar to the Arkansas 99 strain. S1 amino acid sequences of the California variants, CV-56b, CV-9437, and CV-1686, were 97.6–99.3% similar to one another and only 76.6%–76.8% similar to the Arkansas-type strains. Isolate 1013, also from California, was 84.0% similar to Ark DPI and 77.9% similar to CV-56b. When comparing 19 viruses isolated from the United States, sequence variations were observed between amino acids 55–96, 115–149, 255–309, and 378–395. Similar regions are reported to be involved in virus-neutralizing and/or serotype-specific epitopes. These data demonstrate that variant IBV strains continue to emerge, and unique variants may circulate among poultry in geographically isolated areas.

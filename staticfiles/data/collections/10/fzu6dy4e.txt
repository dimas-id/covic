Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% vs 54.2%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3% vs 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1{+/-}12.5 vs 11.5{+/-}10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.

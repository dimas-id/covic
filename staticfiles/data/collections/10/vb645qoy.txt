Participation in education is not an end in itself. What matters for people and for our economies are the skills acquired through education. It is the competence and character qualities that are developed through schooling, rather than the qualifications and credentials gained, that make people successful and resilient in their professional and private lives. They are also key in determining individual well-being and the prosperity of societies.

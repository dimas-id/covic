Lung transplantation has become a viable treatment option for end-stage lung disease. Common indications for lung transplantation are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Either single or bilateral lung transplantation can be performed, but bilateral lung recipients appear to have a better median survival than single lung recipients. Complications after lung transplantation are common and may have nonspecific clinical and radiologic manifestations. The time point at which these complications occur relative to the date of transplant is crucial in formulating a differential diagnosis and recognizing them accurately. Significant advances in imaging techniques and recognition of air trapping in exhalation images and other patterns /distribution of parenchymal abnormalities have led to routine use of HRCT for diagnostic evaluation in patients manifesting respiratory decline in the lung transplant recipient.

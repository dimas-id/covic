The effects of COVID-19 extend beyond the pandemic and are expected to transform healthcare in various ways, many of which remain unknown. With social distancing, telemedicine may become the preferred communication channel between caregivers and patients. Implications for cerebral palsy (CP) children are that this will pose a challenge within this transformation. CP, as a discreet entity, is not considered a risk factor. However, specific comorbidities in individuals with CP, such as chronic lung disease, are known as COVID-19 risk factors. The overall risk for the CP population is probably a factor of age and comorbidities. Staying at home for CP children is both a challenge and an opportunity. Escalation of behavioral conflicts or improved participation and equality within the household may emerge. Interestingly, restricted mobility for the general population narrows existing gaps of ambulation. Telemedicine is the primary way of providing services for chronic conditions during the pandemic and is expected to expand beyond pre-Coronavirus era use. The advantages of telemedicine vary, more so during pandemic times, according to severity, restrictions, and availably of telemedicine. A multidisciplinary therapeutic presence is more accessible with telemedicine, bringing together various specialties and approaches to the child's natural environment. Accessible, continuous care is expected to lower comorbidities, as demonstrated for other chronic conditions. Enhanced monitoring is crucial for younger children as devastating complications, such as hip dysplasia, could be minimized. Last but not least, we will discuss digital health care as an accelerator for participatory medicine, including networked patients and families, as responsible drivers of their health as full partners.

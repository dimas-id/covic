Objective: To analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Method: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients admitted from January 31st to February 5th at isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were divided into non-survival group and survival group according to the clinical outcomes 5 weeks after admission. Data including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results were obtained. Cardiac injury was defined as serum concentration of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) above 0.04 Î¼g/L. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to plotted survival curve and analyze the impact of myocardial injury on the survival outcome of COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 202 patients were included, the age was 63 (51, 70) years old, 88 (43.6%) of them were male, 85 (42.1%) of them had comorbidities, 125 (61.9%) of them were severely to critically ill. Till March 11, 33 patients died, all of them were critically ill patients. The age, proportion of males, comorbidities, respire rate, serum levels of hs-cTnI and incidence of heart failure in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P<0.05). The hospitalization time of non-survival group was significantly shorter than that of survival group (6(4, 9) vs. 32(23, 36), P<0.001). Myocardial injury was an important prognostic factor of COVID-19 (HR=5.382, 95%CI 2.404-12.05, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the presence of myocardial injury was significantly associated with the reduced survival rate among COVID-19 patients (P<0.001). Conclusion: Myocardial injury is an important prognostic factor of COVID-19, COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury face a significantly higher risk of death.

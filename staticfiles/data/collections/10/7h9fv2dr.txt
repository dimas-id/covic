OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence of fever among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 at a single centre. Temperature at time of testing and on repeat testing within 24 h were collected. RESULTS: At the time of testing, fever was detected (sensitivity) in 16 of 86 (19%; 95% CI: 11-28) episodes of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2. With repeat testing, fever was detected in 18 of 75 (24%; 95% CI: 15-35) episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In an Australian hospital, screening for fever lacked sensitivity for detection of people with SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

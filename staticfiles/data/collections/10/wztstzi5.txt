Monoclonal antibodies, engineered antibodies, and antibody fragments have become important biological therapeutic platforms. The IgG format with bivalent binding sites has a modular structure with different biological roles, i.e., effector and binding functions, in different domains. We demonstrated the reconstruction of an IgG-like domain structure in vitro by protein ligation using protein trans-splicing. We produced various binding domains to replace the binding domain of IgG from Escherichia coli and the Fc domain of human IgG from Brevibacillus choshinensis as split-intein fusions. We showed that in vitro protein ligation could produce various Fc-fusions at the N-terminus in vitro from the independently produced domains from different organisms. We thus propose an off-the-shelf approach for the combinatorial production of Fc fusions in vitro with several distinct binding domains, particularly from naturally occurring binding domains. Antiviral lectins from algae are known to inhibit virus entry of HIV and SARS coronavirus. We demonstrated that a lectin could be fused with the Fc-domain in vitro by protein ligation, producing an IgG-like molecule as a “lectibody”. Such an Fc-fusion could be produced in vitro by this approach, which could be an attractive method for developing potential therapeutic agents against rapidly emerging infectious diseases like SARS coronavirus without any genetic fusion and expression optimization.

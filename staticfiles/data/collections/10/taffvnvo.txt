PURPOSE Ovarian masses in the pediatric population are commonly resected with a three or four port laparoscopic approach. Single-incision laparoscopic (SIL) resection is an alternative approach. However, there is limited experience with this modality in ovarian mass resection. METHODS We reviewed SIL ovarian mass resections performed by our group from 2010 to 2012. We evaluated patient demographics, surgery statistics, and hospital course. RESULTS Six patients were identified with mean age of 14 years. Imaging studies showed cystic masses ranging 4-6 cm in five patients, and 20 cm in one patient. One patient presented with recurrent teratoma. Pathology revealed four benign teratomas, one benign cyst, and one serous cystadenoma. Average operating time was 75 min. All patients had an ovarian-preserving resection. Three patients had cyst spillage, including the one who presented with recurrence (this was the only patient with a subsequent recurrence). Hospital stay averaged 37 h. Narcotic use averaged 9.9 mg of morphine daily. All patients had excellent cosmetic results, and no postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Ovarian cystic mass excision using the SIL approach carries a higher risk of tumor spillage. Although the incidence of malignancy is low, they cannot be conclusively excluded with our current preoperative evaluations. At this time, we recommend SIL resection only for simple cysts with low malignant potential; however, further experience with this procedure will likely improve the risk of tumor spillage in the future.

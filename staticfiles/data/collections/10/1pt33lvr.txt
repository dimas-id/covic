Immune‚Äêmediated neutropenia, also termed autoimmune neutropenia (AIN), is an uncommon event, rarely documented within veterinary literature, although the clinical profile and probable pathogenesis have been outlined in detail within medical literature. In this paper, we review 2 different manifestations of this disorder. The 1st case primarily involved peripheral destruction of mature neutrophils, with little impact on marrow precursors, whereas the 2nd case resulted in suppression of neutrophilic granulopoiesis within marrow. In both cases, absolute neutrophil counts dropped below 200/mL.

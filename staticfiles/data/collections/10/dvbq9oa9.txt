OBJECTIVE To investigate the hematological changes and related gene mutation of post-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients with osteonecrosis so as to find the sensitive molecular symbols for early screening of the high risk populations. METHODS Fast peripheral venous blood samples were collected from 61 post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis, 25 males and 36 females, aged 30.4 (20 - 60), and 52 sex and age-matched healthy persons as controls. ELISA was used to detect the coagulation and fibrinolysis indicators: activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), protein C (PC), antithrombin III (AT-III), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), activated protein C resistance (APC-R), plasminogen (PLG), von Willebrand factor (VWF), D-dimer (D-D), and fibrinogen (Fib). Real-time PCR was used to detect the mutation of factor V G1601A (FV Leiden) and prothrombin G20210A. RESULTS The levels of PC, AT-III, and PLG of the osteonecrosis group were 85% +/- 34%, 84 +/- 29%, and 69 +/- 23%, significantly lower than that of the control group (109% +/- 20%, 104% +/- 14%, and 94% +/- 15% respectively, all P < 0.01). PAI of the osteonecrosis group was 16 U/ml +/- 14 U/ml, significantly higher than that of the control group (8.0 U/ml +/- 4.3 U/ml, P < 0.01). The percentage of patients with abnormal indicators was 99.5% (54/61) in the osteonecrosis group, significantly higher than that of the control group (36.5%, 19/52, P < 0.01). The percentage of patients with 3 or more abnormal indicators was 72.1% (44/61) in the osteonecrosis group, significantly higher than that of the control group (17.3%, 9/52, P < 0.01). No mutations of F V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A was found in both groups. CONCLUSION Trends of hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis exist in the post-SARS patients with osteonecrosis. APTT, PC, AT-III, and PLG can be used as sensitive indicator for screening high risk populations of osteonecrosis.

INTRODUCTION The treatment of incompetent truncal veins has been innovated by the introduction of minimally invasive non-thermal non-tumescent (NTNT) techniques. One of these consists of the use of cyanoacrylate glue to occlude the vein lumen by means of the VenaSeal device. Areas covered: This expert-review aims to evaluate NTNT ablation of incompetent saphenous trunks using the VenaSeal device. Expert commentary: Cyanoacrylate adhesive embolization of incompetent truncal veins using the VenaSeal device is a safe and efficacious innovative technique. Further studies are needed to evaluate anatomical and clinical outcomes at long term.

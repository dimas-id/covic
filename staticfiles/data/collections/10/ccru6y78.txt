The high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients is mainly caused by the progression from mild to critical illness. To identify the key laboratory indicators and stratify high-risk COVID-19 patients with progression to severe/critical illness, we compared 474 moderate patients and 74 severe/critical patients. The laboratory indicators, including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), monocytes percentage, etc. were significantly higher in the severe/critical patients (P <0.001) and showed a noticeable change at about a week before the diagnosis. Based on these indicators, we constructed a risk-stratification model, which can accurately grade the severity of patients with COVID-19 (accuracy = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94 - 0.989, sensitivity = 0.98, specificity = 0.84). Also, compared with non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, we found that COVID-19 had weaker dysfunction to the heart, liver, and kidney. The prognostic model based on laboratory indicators could help to diagnose, monitor, and predict severity at an early stage to those patients with COVID-19.

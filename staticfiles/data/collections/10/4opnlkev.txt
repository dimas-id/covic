We report the anharmonic effect of the Raman-scattering spectrum in the low-carrier density superconductor SrxBi2Se3, which is dominated by quartic term. Compared to the parent Bi2Se3, the superconducting SrxBi2Se3crystals show obvious phonon softening in the three optical phonon modes A1g1, Eg2, and A1g2. Based on the simulations by the Fano function, we present a compelling evidence of the enhanced electron-phonon coupling in SrxBi2Se3for its smaller asymmetric parameterq. Moreover, an anomalous broadening and intensity antiresonance in the characteristic Raman peaks were observed as the temperature decreased to around 160 K. Thus, the superconducting topological material SrxBi2Se3represents a counterintuitive example where the electron-phonon interaction is strengthened by the accumulation of electron carriers.

PURPOSE Patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are at risk of infection, including odontogenic infections, during induction chemotherapy. It is unknown whether clinical dental screening to diagnose and treat odontogenic disease in these patients can reduce the incidence of dental emergencies. METHODS Between November 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, we screened 147 patients with newly diagnosed AML before their admission for induction chemotherapy (n1 = 147, "screened" group). The patients not screened acted as controls (n2 = 190, "unscreened" group), as did patients diagnosed with AML in the 26 months before the initiation of the screening program (n3 = 304, "prescreening" group). The number of patients in each group who presented for emergency dental assessment during admission for induction chemotherapy was determined by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS Among the 147 patients in the screened group, only 1 patient presented with an infectious odontogenic emergency (0.68% [95% CI, -0.64% to 1.98%]). In the unscreened group, 8 developed an infectious odontogenic emergency during induction chemotherapy (4.21% [95% CI, 1.37% to 7.15%]), a statistically significant difference (P = .046, a = 0.05). A similar rate of infectious dental emergencies was observed in the prescreening group (4.28% [95% CI, 2.0% to 7.2%]). CONCLUSION Clinical dental screening before induction chemotherapy in patients with AML resulted in a 6-fold reduction in infectious dental emergencies during the induction period.

Abstract Efflux pumps play a major role in the increasing antimicrobial resistance rendering a large number of drugs of no use. Large numbers of pathogens are becoming multidrug resistant due to inadequate dosage and use of the existing antimicrobials. This leads to the need for identifying new efflux pump inhibitors. Design of novel targeted therapies using inherent complexity involved in the biological network modeling has gained increasing importance in recent times. The predictive approaches should be used to determine antimicrobial activities with high pathogen specificity and microbicidal potency. Antimicrobial peptides, which are part of our innate immune system, have the ability to respond to infections and have gained much attention in making resistant strain sensitive to existing drugs. In this review paper, we outline evidences linking host-directed therapy with the efflux pump activity to infectious disease.

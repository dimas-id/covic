This case report describes congestive heart failure with pleural effusion in two middle‐aged, pet house rabbits. Both had a history of acute onset dyspnoea, weakness and weight loss. Bi‐atrial enlargement was seen on echocardiography in both rabbits. One rabbit had atrial fibrillation and ventricular premature complexes identified on electrocardiography. There was a radiographically evident pleural effusion in both rabbits and thoracocentesis was undertaken in one rabbit. These findings were confirmed on post‐mortem examination. The aetiology for the underlying heart disease was not found, but the potential types of cardiomyopathies are discussed.

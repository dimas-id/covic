Objectives Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has many vital functions in human body and its endogenous level can be affected either by various diseases or by administrated drugs. This study reveals the effect of atorvastatin, amlodipine and ethoxidol on the endogenous CoQ10 plasma concentration. Methods It was determined the total plasma concentration of endogenous CoQ10 in the plasma of 54 healthy individuals and 62 patients with cardiovascular diseases during treatment with various drugs using high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS). Results It was found that CoQ10 plasma concentration in patients is statistically significantly lower (on average -49.0 &#916;%) than in practically healthy individuals. The total CoQ10 plasma level in patients receiving atorvastatin in the complex therapy is statistically significantly lower (-15.2 &#916;%), and in patients taking amlodipine or ethoxidol is statistically significantly higher (+18.2 and + 20.2 &#916;%, respectively) than in patients of control groups (a group of patients who receive the same drugs, except for the studied one). Conclusions The study showed that in patients with CVDs treated with various drugs the CoQ10 plasma level is statistically significantly lower than in practically healthy individuals. So, to avoid the adverse reactions connected with low CoQ10 plasma levels, it is recommended to adjust the therapy to maintain its constant level.

Objective; To explore the effects of acupuncture on the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP(1)) gene of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in obese rats.Methods: The expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT was determined with RT-PCR technique. The changes of body weight, Lee’s index, body fat, and the expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT in obese rats were observed before and after acupuncture.Results: The body weight, Lee’s index, body fat in obese rats were all markedly higher than those in normal rats, but the expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT in obese rats was all lower than that in normal rats. There were negative correlation between the obesity index and the expression of UCP(1) gene in BAT. After acupuncture the marked effect of weight loss was achieved while the expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT obviously increased in obese rats.Conclusion: The abnormal reduction for expression of UCP(1) gene of BAT might be an important cause for the obesity. To promote the expression of UCP(1) in obese organism might be an important cellular and molecular mechanism in anti-obesity effect by acupuncture.

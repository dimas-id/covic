Environmental monitoring is critical in a developing country like Egypt where there is an insufficient framework for recording and tracking outbreaks. In this study, the prevalence of human adenovirus (HAdV), rotavirus group A (RVA) was determined in urban sewage, activated sludge, drainage water, drainage sediment, Nile water, and Nile sediment, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. HAdV was detected in 50% of urban sewage with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 genome copies/liter (GC/L), 33% of activated sludge with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/kilogram (GC/kg), 95% of drainage water with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, 75% of drainage sediment with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, 50% of Nile water with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, and 45% of Nile sediment with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/kg. RVA was detected in 50% of urban sewage with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, 75% of activated sludge with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, 58% of drainage water with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, 50% of drainage sediment with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/L, and 45% of Nile water with viral concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 GC/kg. In conclusion, Abu-Rawash WWTP acts as a source of HAdV and RVA, releasing them into El-Rahawy drain then to the River Nile Rosetta branch.

Background Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis removes the diseased tissue in ulcerative colitis but also allows gastrointestinal continuity and stoma-free living. Pouch strictures are a complication with a reported incidence of 5-38%. The three areas where pouch strictures occur are in the pouch inlet, mid-pouch and pouch-anal anastomosis. Aim To undertake a systematic review of the literature and to identify management strategies available for pouch-anal, mid-pouch and pre-pouch ileal strictures and their outcomes. Methods A computer-assisted search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE limited to 1966 to February 2016 was performed. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, observational studies and case reports were considered. Those where data could not be extracted were excluded. Results Twenty-two articles were considered eligible. Pouch-anal strictures have been initially managed using predominately dilators which include bougie and Hegar dilators with various surgical procedures advocated when initial dilatation fails. Mid-pouch strictures are relatively unstudied with both medical, endoscopic and surgical management reported as successful. Pouch inlet strictures can be safely managed using a combined medical and endoscopic approach. Conclusion The limited evidence available suggests that pouch-anal strictures are best treated in a stepwise fashion with initial treatment to include digital or instrumental dilatation followed by surgical revision or resection. Management of mid-pouch strictures requires a combination of medical, endoscopic and surgical management. Pouch inlet strictures are best managed using a combined medical and endoscopic approach. Future studies should compare different treatment modalities on separate stricture locations to enable an evidenced-based treatment algorithm.

Teaching how to program in Primary Education has attracted a great deal of attention in the last years. However, it is still unclear the approach to achieve higher learning and satisfaction levels. In this paper, the proposal is focused on the use of an emotional learning companion called Alcody. To compare whether to insert emotional elements have an equal or more significant effect on students’ satisfaction and learning than personalization and execution, 137 children between 10–12 years were randomly split into four groups for three months. The higher learning and satisfaction levels are registered for the students in the group with execution, personalization and emotion management.

Abstract Due to the government’s early intervention such as mass lock-down and curtailment strategies towards mass gatherings, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the organization of the voluntary blood donation camps have been suspended. It’s most significant impact on the blood community has been a dramatic reduction in the number of blood donors. Therefore, our blood stock has almost dried up and put our inventory in a state of jeopardy. Additionally, all the elective surgeries and non-urgent clinical interventions have also been deferred during this time. This has led to a drop in the blood collection, demand as well as the issue at our blood center. With this background, we intended to assess the effect of this lock-down on our blood supply management particularly in two phases [phase-I prior to outbreak] and phase-II [during the outbreak]. Transitioning back to normal conditions would most likely depend on the extent and the time duration of this pandemic and associated behavioural change, which is anticipated to remain in effect well beyond the original estimates.

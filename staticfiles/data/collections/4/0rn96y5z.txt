Practical relevance Generalised ataxia is one of the most common neurological presentations identified in cats in practice. The causes can be subdivided into three forms on the basis of the neuroanatomical diagnosis: cerebellar, vestibular and sensory (spinal or general proprioceptive) ataxia. The type of ataxia will determine the diagnostic procedures and select the differential diagnoses, and an accurate neuroanatomical diagnosis is therefore essential. The differential diagnosis list can then be further tailored on the basis of patient signalment, clinical presentation and progression. Global importance Irrespective of the world region, most of the causes of generalised ataxia in the cat are similar and many have been identified for a number of years (cerebellar hypoplasia has been recognised since the late 19th century). However, it is the advent of new technology, in particular veterinary access to magnetic resonance imaging, which has resulted in particularly rapid advances in our understanding, investigation and management of these different forms of ataxia. Audience This article introduces the classification of patients with ataxia on the basis of their clinical presentation, discusses the common differential diagnoses associated with each form, and briefly reviews the more important diseases from a clinical perspective. It is aimed at all veterinarians who treat cats.

SARS is a highly contagious infection, caused by new coronavirus SARS-CoV. Immunopathological mechanisms responsible for the reaction to SARS-CoV infection have not yet been fully elucidated. Cytokine profile of SARS patients showed marked elevation of Th1 cytokine, interferon gamma, inflammatory cytokines for at least 2 weeks after the onset of the disease. The clinical manifestation of SARS in patients has been of varied nature. Fever of more then 38 degrees C, lasting more then 24 hours, is the most frequently encountered symptom. Other symptoms are non specific and they may include: sore throat, myalgia and nausea. The results of the radiological investigation may appear normal. Infants born to pregnant women with SARS did not appear to have acquired the infection through vertical transmission. However, direct contact with the maternal body fluid which contained SARS-CoV, has put the infants in great danger of perinatal infection. Ribavirin and corticosteroids are usually suggested for the treatment of SARS. However, the ribavirin therapy increases the risk of teratogenic effects in newborns of pregnant women with SARS. Therefore, the usage of this drug is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation.

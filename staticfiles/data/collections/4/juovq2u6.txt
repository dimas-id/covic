We are celebrating the 10th anniversary of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy (RARC) with urinary diversion (UD), and it seems that this operation is successfully following the footsteps of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Until now, approximately 1000 RARCs have been recorded; of them, only 102 were performed totally intracorporeally with a formation of an ileal neobladder. Despite the small numbers, morbidity and functional outcomes seem to be acceptable, when compared with the gold standard-the open procedure. It is imperative that in a challenging procedure such as this, the console surgeon follow a standardized protocol of all surgical steps to ensure the optimal results. In this article, we are sharing Karolinska's experience and discuss all perioperative issues along with ways of dealing with tricky cases.

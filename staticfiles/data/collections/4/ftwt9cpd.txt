Surprisingly, estimated voxel displacement maps (VDMs), based on image registration, seem to work just as well to correct geometrical distortion in functional MRI data (EPI) as VDMs based on actual information about the magnetic field. In this article, we compare our new image registration-based distortion correction method ‘COPE’ to an implementation of the pixelshift method. Our approach builds on existing image registration-based techniques using opposite phase encoding, extending these by local cost aggregation. Comparison of these methods with 3T and 7T spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GE) data show that the image registration-based method is a good alternative to the fieldmap-based EPI distortion correction method.

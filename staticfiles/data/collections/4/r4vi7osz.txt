Acute viral gastroenteritis is second only to the common cold as a cause of illness in the United States. It often occurs in outbreaks, sometimes associated with food or water, and is a major recurrent problem in public health. Although most infections are self-limited, viral gastroenteritis can cause severe dehydration (particularly rotavirus), as well as chronic diarrhea in children with immunodeficiency syndromes such as severe combined immunodeficiency. Enteric viral infections are also a significant cause of diarrhea in patients with AIDS. Similar to adenovirus, rotavirus and enterovirus are associated with intussusception in children.

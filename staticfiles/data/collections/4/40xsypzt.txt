SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, is an RNA virus prone to mutations. Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein with the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is pivotal for attachment and entry of the virus. Yet, natural mutations acquired on S protein during the pandemic and their impact on viral infectivity, transmission dynamics and disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed 2952 SARS-CoV-2 genomes across the globe, and identified a total of 1815 non-synonymous mutations in the S-protein that fall into 54 different types. We observed that six of these distinct mutations were located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region that directly engages host ACE2. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that these RBD mutations cluster into distinct phyletic clades among global subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 implying possible emergence of novel sublineages of the strain. Structure-guided homology modelling and docking analysis predicted key molecular rearrangements in the ACE2 binding interface of RBD mutants that could result in altered virus-host interactions. We propose that our findings could be significant in understanding disease dynamics and in developing vaccines, antibodies and therapeutics for COVID-19. Importance COVID-19 pandemic shows considerable variations in disease transmission and pathogenesis globally, yet reasons remain unknown. Our study identifies key S-protein mutations prevailing in SARS-CoV-2 strain that could alter viral attachment and infectivity. We propose that the interplay of these mutations could be one of the factors driving global variations in COVID-19 spread. In addition, the mutations identified in this study could be an important indicator in predicting efficacies of vaccines, antibodies and therapeutics that target SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 interface.

We examined human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene polymorphisms in the Maonan people from southern China. HLA‐A, ‐B and ‐DRB1 alleles were determined in 108 healthy unrelated Maonan individuals by the polymerase chain reaction‐Luminex method, and haplotype frequencies for HLA‐A, ‐B and ‐DRB1 loci were estimated. The most frequent HLA‐A alleles were A*1101 (35.2%), A*0203 (17.6%), A*0207 (13.4%) and A*2402 (13.4%); HLA‐B alleles were B*1301(19.9%), B*1502 (14.8%), B*4601 (13.4%) and B*4001 (13.4%); HLA‐DRB1 alleles were DRB1*1202 (17.1%), DRB1*1602 (13.0%) and DRB1*1401 (10.7%). The most common haplotypes were A*0207‐B*4601 (10.6%), A*1101‐B*1301 (10.0%), A*1101‐B*4001 (8.4%), B*1502‐DRB1*1202 (12.0%), B*4601‐DRB1*1401 (5.8%), A*1101‐B*1502‐DRB1*1202 (7.1%) and A*0207‐B*4601‐DRB1*1401 (5.3%), profiles that are also found in populations from the southern region of East Asia. Phylogenetic and principal component analyses revealed that the Maonan people belong to the southeastern Asian group and are most closely related to the Buyi people.

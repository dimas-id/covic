Lipocalins are a family of secreted adipokines which play important roles in various biological processes. Lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) has been shown to be involved in acute and chronic inflammation. This particular protein is critical in the pathogenesis of several diseases including cancer, diabetes, obesity, and multiple sclerosis. Herein, we discuss the general molecular basis for the involvement of LCN-2 in acute infections and chronic disease progression and also ascertain the probable role of LCN-2 in ocular diseases, particularly in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We elaborate on the signaling cascades which trigger LCN-2 upregulation in AMD and suggest therapeutic strategies for targeting such pathways.

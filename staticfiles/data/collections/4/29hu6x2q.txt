Mycoplasma bovis was isolated from the tympanic bullae of dairy calves with an exudative otitis media. The history, clinical signs, gross and histologic lesions, and bacteriologic findings are described for 5 preweaned Holstein calves with otitis media from a 600-cow dairy in Michigan. Clinical findings consisted of unilateral or bilateral ear droop, epiphora, head tilt, and recumbency in severely affected calves. Postmortem examination revealed unilateral or bilateral fibrinosuppurative to caseous exudate in the tympanic bullae. Histologically, a marked fibrinosuppurative to caseous exudate filled the tympanic air spaces. The partially ulcerated tympanic mucosa was markedly thickened with mononuclear cell infiltration and proliferation of fibrous connective tissue. Bone remodeling and periosteal hyperostosis were present in some osseous septa. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated from the tympanic bullae of all 5 calves and from the lungs of 2 calves and the frontal sinus of 1 calf. Mycoplasma bovis was isolated at > 100,000 colony forming units/ml from the bulk milk tank of the farm of origin. The isolation of M. bovis from the bulk milk tank, indicating subclinical mycoplasmal mastitis coupled with the feeding of waste milk from mastitic cows to calves is suggestive of a possible source of the infection resulting in otitis media in preweaned dairy calves.

In this paper we reflect on a number of IT related challenges during the COVID19 pandemic, primarily from a CIO and IT professionals perspective. We consider three time periods, namely the period before the pandemic, the response to the pandemic and the period after it. For each period we discuss the key challenges that practitioners faced and outline important areas to consider for the future. Hopefully, the lessons learnt and the experiences gained will positively inform future academic research and practice.

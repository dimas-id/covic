Abstract The second smallest subgenomic messenger RNA, mRNA5, of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus includes in its “5′ unique region” two separate open reading frames (5a and 5b), whose coding function has not so far been established, and thus it may represent a dicistronic messenger RNA. We report here that two polypeptides with the sizes expected for the 5a and 5b products can be synthesised by in vitro translation of a single artificial mRNA containing both the 5a and 5b ORFs. To establish whether these polypeptides represent genuine virus gene products, both the 5a and 5b coding sequences were expressed as bacterial fusion proteins, and these were used to raise monospecific antisera. Antisera raised against both the 5a and 5b-specific sequences recognized specifically proteins of the expected size in infectious bronchitis virus-infected chicken kidney and Vero cells, indicating that 5a and 5b do represent genuine virus genes, and suggesting that mRNA5 is indeed functionally dicistronic.

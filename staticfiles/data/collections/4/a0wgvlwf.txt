BACKGROUND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the best-known and most commonly performed bariatric procedures. However, this procedure carries infrequent but serious long-term complications, which may require revisional procedures. This study reports the indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal that have not been described well in the literature. METHODS A multicenter retrospective study of 50 patients who underwent reversal of RYGB conducted between 2006 and 2015 was reviewed to describe the usual indications and outcomes of gastric bypass reversal surgeries. RESULTS Of 50 patients, 7 (14 %) were males and 43 (86 %) were females. The mean age of the patient population was 40.4 ± 11.6 years (range 19-66). Reasons for reversal included anastomotic ulcers (n = 27), anastomotic complications (n = 9), malnutrition (n = 2), and functional disorder (n = 12). The mean BMI before the reversal was 29 ± 9.4 kg/m(2) (range 16-60). The mean time between the primary procedure and reversal was 60 ± 65.5 months (range 2-300). Fourteen of the reversals were done via laparotomy. Mean hospital stay was 8.4 ± 7.3 days (range 3-34 days). There was no peri-operative death 30 days after reversal. Following gastric bypass reversal, 92.6 % (n = 25) of the patient population had resolution from ulcers, 77.8 % (n = 7) of the patient population had resolution from anatomic complications, 100 % (n = 2) of the patient population had resolution from malnutrition, and 66.7 % (n = 8) of the patient population had resolution from functional disorders. CONCLUSIONS Gastric bypass reversal is a reasonable and safe treatment for complications arising from the GBP surgery. A laparoscopic approach is feasible in select patients.

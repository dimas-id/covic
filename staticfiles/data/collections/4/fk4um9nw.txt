Publisher Summary Pulmonary pathology includes a large spectrum of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases that affect the lung. Many of these are a result of the unusual relationship of the lung with the outside world. Every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents, organic and inorganic particles, and noxious agents of all types. Although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults, these are not infallible; therefore, lung pathology arises. Damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism. Any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body, since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need. Pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur. This chapter presents a review of lung pathology and the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis of each disease. It suggests that a clear understanding of both morphology and mechanism is required for the development of new therapies and preventive measures.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is posing a huge threat to human health worldwide. We aim to investigate the immune status of CD8(+) T and NK cells in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The count and immune status of lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy individuals. RESULTS: As the disease progression in COVID-19 patients, CD8(+) T and NK cells were significantly decreased in absolute number but highly activated. After patients' condition improved, the count and immune status of CD8(+) T and NK cells restored to some extent. GrA(+)CD8(+) T and perforin(+) NK cells had good sensitivity and specificity for assisting diagnosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: As the disease progression, the declined lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients might lead to compensatory activation of CD8(+) T and NK cells. GrA(+)CD8(+) T and perforin(+) NK cells might be used as meaningful indicators for assisting diagnosis of COVID-19.

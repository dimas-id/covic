Objectives: Recent data suggest higher COVID-19 rates and severity in Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. The mechanisms underlying such associations remain unclear. We aimed to study the association between ethnicity and risk of COVID-19 infection and disentangle any correlation with socioeconomic deprivation or previous comorbidity. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: UK Biobank linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and COVID-19 tests until 14 April 2020. Participants: UK Biobank participants from England, excluding drop-outs and deaths. Main measures: COVID-19 infection based on a positive PCR test. Ethnicity was self-reported and classified using Office of National Statistics groups. Socioeconomic status was based on index of multiple deprivation quintiles. Comorbidities were self-reported and completed from HES. Analyses: Multivariable Poisson analysis to estimate incidence rate ratios of COVID-19 infection according to ethnicity, adjusted for socioeconomic status, alcohol drinking, smoking, body mass index, age, sex, and comorbidity. Results: 415,582 participants were included, with 1,416 tested and 651 positive for COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was 0.61% (95% CI: 0.46%-0.82%) in Black/Black British participants, 0.32% (0.19%-0.56%) in other ethnicities, 0.32% (0.23%-0.47%) in Asian/Asian British, 0.30% (0.11%-0.80%) in Chinese, 0.16% (0.06%-0.41%) in mixed, and 0.14% (0.13%-0.15%) in White. Compared with White participants, Black/Black British participants had an adjusted relative risk (RR) of 3.30 (2.39-4.55), Chinese participants 3.00 (1.11-8.06), Asian/Asian British participants 2.04 (1.36-3.07), other ethnicities 1.93 (1.08-3.45), and mixed ethnicities 1.07 (0.40-2.86). Socioeconomic status (adjusted RR 1.93 (1.51-2.46) for the most deprived), obesity (adjusted RR 1.04 (1.02-1.05) per kg/m2) and comorbid hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and specific renal diseases were also associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19 rates in the UK are higher in BAME communities, those living in deprived areas, obese patients, and patients with previous comorbidity. Public health strategies are needed to reduce COVID-19 infections among the most susceptible groups.

Summary We report the airway management of a patient suspected of being COVID-19 positive with impending airway obstruction requiring urgent surgical tracheostomy To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an awake tracheal intubation in a suspected COVID-19 positive patient Various modifications were put in place during the awake tracheal intubation and surgical tracheostomy procedures to minimise aerosol generation from the patient, such as avoiding high flow nasal oxygen, establishing conscious sedation with remifentanil prior to commencing airway topicalisation and avoiding trans-tracheal local anaesthetic infiltration A multidisciplinary team discussion prior to performing the case highlighted aspects of both the airway management and the surgical procedure where particular care and modifications are required There is a lack of national guidance for awake tracheal intubation and tracheostomy in COVID-19 cases This report nevertheless addresses the key procedural modifications required

Upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is a nonspecific term used to describe acute infections involving the nose, paranasal sinuses, pharynx, and larynx above the vocal cords. The aim of this study was to provide a summary of the most common pathogens of URI and to compare advantages and disadvantages of traditional and new rapid microbiological tests used to identify them. Blood samples were simultaneously examined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel for eight different pathogens in a total of 15 tests performed in nasopharyngeal swabs. The ELISA method is unable to identify the pathologic agent until the host’s immune system elicits a response. The method is readily available in many laboratories at a low cost, which puts less strain on economic resources. The FilmArray(®) Panel, on the other hand, is more expensive, but it is fast and exact in the identification of a broad spectrum etiologic agents. Nonetheless, since most repiratory tract infections are viral in origin and there is no treatment available, the diagnosis provided by the FilmArray Panel does not provide any additional clinical benefit and thus should be used only whenever necessary on the individual basis.

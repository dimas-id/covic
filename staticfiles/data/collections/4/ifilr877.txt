Modification of titanium oxide by multiphase anodic spark deposition (ASD) has the potential to increase bioactivity and hasten osseointegration and biological fixation in uncemented arthroplasty. This study assessed the in vivo performance of control (Ti), plasma-sprayed HA-coated (TiHA) and ASD (Biospark) treated (TiAn) porous titanium implants with a solid core using a standard uncemented implant fixation sheep model. Cortical interfacial shear-strength and bone ingrowth in cortical and cancellous sites were quantified following 12 weeks in situ. Ultimate shear-strength for the Ti, TiHA and TiAn coatings was 33±9.5, 35.4±8.4 and 33.8±7.8 MPa, respectively, which was limited by coating delamination. ASD treatment was associated with significantly higher mean bone ingrowth at both sites. These results support the osteoconductive potential of the BioSpark treatment of porous titanium.

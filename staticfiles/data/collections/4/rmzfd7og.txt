OBJECTIVE To describe the treatment of direct high flow carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas (dCCFs) with the double lumen balloon Scepter C. MATERIALS AND METHODS 7 patients with dCCFs were identified and treated with a double lumen balloon Scepter C. 5 patients had post-traumatic dCCFs and two patients had spontaneous dCCFs due to a ruptured cavernous-carotid aneurysm. The double lumen balloon was used in characterizing the angioarchitecture of the fistula in all patients. The best treatment option was then decided based on the characteristics of the carotid wall tear. Embolization of the cavernous sinus was achieved with coils and injection of Onyx liquid embolic material in three patients and with coils alone in four patients. One patient required stent assisted coiling to reconstruct the internal carotid artery. RESULTS 7 patients with dCCFs were treated with transarterial embolization. All patients had immediate angiographic and clinical cure. The Scepter C balloon was used for balloon assisted coiling and injection of Onyx liquid embolic material. On follow-up, all patients had clinical symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS The Scepter C balloon is a useful tool for the transarterial treatment of dCCFs.

Abstract Access to global information through the Internet has become an essential ingredient to successful practice in travel medicine. Internet sites that may be useful to travel health practitioners include those that represent international organisations (eg. http://www.who.int), national and international professional bodies (eg. http://www.istm.org), national public health and disease control centres (eg. http://www.cdc.gov). These useful sites often include online journals, geographic epidemiological information, regular outbreak alerts and news and downloadable information sheets for travellers, as well as those providing official guidelines and policies in travel medicine. It is also useful to have access to search engines, which can search the literature as well as the Internet.

UNLABELLED BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS: To examine the learning curve of minimally invasive 2-port total laparoscopic myomectomy (TTLM). METHODS TTLM was performed by using only umbilicus and left inguinal ports, for 30 patients at our university affiliated hospital between May 2009 and February 2010. The times required for each of the 5 surgical phases of the early and late cases performed by the same surgeon were compared by using a DVD time counter. RESULTS The mean surgical time was 82.5±5.2 minutes, blood loss was 42.1±7.5mL, and weight of specimen was 65.3±13.3g. The eighth case was the first in which the surgical time fell below the overall mean surgical time. Comparison of the mean time of each phase between the 7 early and the subsequent (late) cases revealed significant differences in the times required for suturing. CONCLUSIONS Although this was a feasibility study, the results suggest that this technique can be mastered after 7 cases. Learning curve, Suturing.

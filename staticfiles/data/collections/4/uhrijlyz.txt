Limbic encephalitis as a distinct clinicopathological entity is becoming increasingly familiar to neurologists. However, despite its classical clinical presentation of mental status changes and behavioral abnormalities, the disorder is not well known in the psychiatric literature and premortem diagnosis is rare. We recently participated in the care of a patient who spent two months on a psychiatric service and in whom a medical disorder was consistently suspected but not confirmed until autopsy revealed paraneoplasic limbic encephalitis and two primary systemic malignancies. A detailed neuropsychiatric description of this clinical entity is provided from presentation to autopsy with review of the literature.

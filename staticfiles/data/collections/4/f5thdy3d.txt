The ability to adapt and utilize emergency facilities is a critical element in responding to surges resulting from man-made and natural events. The current stresses on emergency services throughout the country find few adequately prepared to effectively absorb a sudden increase in patients along with some of the potential special requirements, such as quarantining of epidemic patients and mass decontamination. This article reviews major findings of the federally funded ER One project, a research initiative that has described a number of facility strategies, which should be considered in planning new emergency facilities. An early case study in the application of these principles at the recently completed Tampa General Hospital emergency service is provided, illustrating how, when integrated into the early planning and design, many of the ER One recommendations can be implemented at modest capital cost increases.

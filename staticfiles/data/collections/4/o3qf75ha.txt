Abstract The results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) assays for the diagnosis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection, and the comparison with other diagnostic techniques, such as electron microscopy (EM) and virus isolation using A-72 cell line are reported. The study was carried out on 71 faecal samples of pups with enteritis. Of 71 samples examined 14 were positive in PCR, whereas 30 samples resulted positive in the n-PCR assay. CCV was detected by EM examination in only four out of 45 samples, and by virus isolation in three out of 30 samples n-PCR positive.

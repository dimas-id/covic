PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing numerical and complexity of patients requiring nonoperating room anesthesia (NORA) necessitates a multidisciplinary approach of a highly experienced team in a highly technological setting of the cathlab or radiology suite. These requirements are even more magnified in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: This review describes the aspects of risk stratification both in adults and children with respect to patient morphology, airway management, cardiorespiratory function and finally future developments, which could beneficially interfere with imminent management in NORA. Moreover, some particular features related to COVID-19 are also discussed. SUMMARY: Apart from a thorough preoperative assessment, preventive strategies and well-chosen monitoring should be implemented to preclude inadvertent events in sometimes high-risk patients. Timely preventive measures and early recognition of complications could only be achieved by a multidisciplinary cooperating team. In addition, the implementation of safety measurements due to the infectious transmission to both the patients and care givers is crucial.

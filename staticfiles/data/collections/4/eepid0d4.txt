Medawar, in the early 1950s, recognized for the first time, the unique immunology of the maternal-fetal interface and its potential relevance for transplantation. In his original work, he described the “fetal allograft analogy” whereby the fetus may be viewed as a semi-allogeneic conceptus that has evaded rejection by the maternal immune system. Although numerous hypotheses have been proposed to prove this observation, none have demonstrated that the maternal immune system is antagonist to the invading trophoblast. In the present manuscript we have reviewed recent studies demonstrating the expression and function of TLRs in trophoblast cells and based on this data we propose an alternative view for maternal-fetal immune interactions.

Lambda interferons (IFN位s, type III IFNs or interleukins-28/29) were described fifteen years ago as novel cytokines sharing structural and functional homology with IL-10 and type I IFNs, respectively. IFN位s engage a unique receptor complex comprising IFNLR1 and IL10R2, nevertheless they share signaling cascade and many functions with type I IFNs, questioning their possible non-redundant roles and overall biological importance. Here, we review the latest evidence establishing the primacy of IFN位s in front line protection at anatomical barriers, mediating antiviral immunity before type I IFNs. We also discuss their emerging role in regulating inflammation and limiting host damage, a major difference to type I IFNs. IFN位s come thus to light as dual function cytokines mediating antiviral immunity and damage control.

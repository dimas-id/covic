BACKGROUND Conventional open and conventional laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (CLSD) result in poor quality of life because of damage to the vagal nerve. We have developed vagus nerve-preserving laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (VLSD). This study aimed to evaluate whether VLSD is effective and safe, and to determine whether a reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications improves postoperative quality of life compared with CLSD. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 72 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding and secondary hypersplenism who underwent CLSD (n = 40) or VLSD (n = 32) between April 2015 and December 2016. Their demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared. RESULTS No patients required conversion to laparotomy in CLSD and VLSD. There was no difference in estimated intraoperative blood loss, volume of intraoperative blood transfused, time to first flatus, time to off-bed activity, and postoperative hospital stay between the two groups. VLSD was associated with a shorter operation time (P = 0.020) and less postoperative complications (P < 0.0001), including less diarrhea (P < 0.0001), epigastric fullness (P < 0.0001), and delayed gastric emptying (P < 0.0001), compared with CLSD. With VLSD, there was a significant increase in body weight and plasma albumin levels at 6 months postoperatively compared with preoperative values (all P < 0.05). The curative effect of improving esophageal/gastric variceal bleeding was similar in the groups. CONCLUSIONS VLSD is effective and safe for reducing the incidence of postoperative complications, contributing to improving postoperative quality of life.

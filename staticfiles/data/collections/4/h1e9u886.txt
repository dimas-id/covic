The total kappa/lambda immunoglobulin light chain ratio and the kappa/lambda ratios within each of the serum immunoglobulin classes G. A. and M were measured in thirteen patients with humoral immunological disorders. Of those patients, eight had common variable immunodeficiency whereas live patients had other forms of humoral immunological deficiencies. Eleven patients had abnormal antibody response in vivo. All but three of the thirteen patients had clearly abnormal light chain ratios in one or more of the immunoglobulin classes. We conclude that humoral immunological disorders, usually characterized by abnormal heavy chain production and a disturbed antibody response, may frequently have a concomitant abnormal synthesis of the light chains resulting in an abnormal kappa/lambda light chain ratio.

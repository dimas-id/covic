A double-antibody ELISA for the detection of coronaviruses in intestinal contents from turkey poults with diarrhea was developed. Antibodies were raised in rabbits and guinea pigs against a Minnesota isolate of turkey enteric coronavirus (TCV) propagated in embryonating turkey eggs and were purified by density-gradient centrifugation. The specificity of antisera was confirmed by hemagglutination-inhibition and immunoelectron microscopy. Absorption of anti-TCV hyperimmune sera with egg extracts or egg ovalbumin and the use of different dilution and blocking buffers influenced the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA. Reciprocal cross-reactivity was detected among turkey, chicken, bovine, and murine coronaviruses. Antisera to the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine, the rabbit enteric coronavirus, or the human coronavirus strain 299E failed to react with TCV. The TCV cross-reacted only moderately with the avian infectious bronchitis virus and the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine. Investigations with samples from 47 commercial turkey flocks in Quebec with episodes of transmissible enteritis revealed that the ELISA was more sensitive than was electron microscopy for detection of TCV.

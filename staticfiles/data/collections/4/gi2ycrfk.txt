The prevalence of obesity in the United States is increasing, with extreme morbid obesity of body mass index greater than 40 increasing twice as fast as obesity in general. With the increased weight comes an increased risk of comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems such as obstructive sleep apnea or restrictive lung disease, skin disorders such as intertrigo and cellulitis, and urinary incontinence. Thus, patients exposed to a variety of disasters not only are increasingly overweight but also have an associated number of coexistent medical conditions that require increased support with medical devices and medications. This article focuses on management of the morbidly obese patients during disasters.

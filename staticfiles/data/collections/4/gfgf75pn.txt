Recently, a novel virus has spread worldwide causing the disease called COVID-19. In addition to putting peopleâ€™s lives at risk and causing mortality, various problems have occurred due to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantine, social distancing, and the obligation to use protective tools have led to sometimes long term closing of various jobs and services, including rehabilitation services. For instance, the disease has interrupted the provision of Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) services to children due to the need for face-to-face communication between Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs) and children during the evaluation and treatment processes. Therefore, here, we described the quality of providing SLP services during the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative effects of the disease on the provision of SLP services. In addition, we made an attempt to explain concerns and problems raised by the families, the importance of providing SLP services during the critical period of speech and language development, telepractice services, the roles of speech-language-hearing related scientific associations, and the roles of SLPs during the outbreak of COVID-19.

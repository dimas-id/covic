Cervical neoplastic lesions are associated with infection by high-risk human papilloma-viruses (HPV). The two genotypes most frequently found in the lesions are HPV-16 and HPV-18 with a prevalence of 50-60% and 15-18%, respectively. The E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins are involved in the transformation process and represent foreign antigens for the host. We previously reported that anti-HPV-18 E6 CD4(+) T cells are present in patients with high-grade HPV-18-expressing cervical lesions but also in 50% of the total consecutive patients tested, independently of the HPV type carried. These results indicated that HPV-18 E6 is immunogenic and suggested that all responsive patients, irrespective of the HPV expressed, had encountered HPV-18 and cleared the infection. Here, we investigated anti-HPV-18 E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in a cohort of 23 HPV-18 E6-responsive patients. We found that, although E7-specific CD4(+) T cells were present in all women, a robust T helper type (Th1)/Th2 type response against E7 was associated with HPV-18-negative status, suggesting that indeed these patients might have cleared the virus. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found strong anti-E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in 20% of 24 healthy donors without evidence of disease. In contrast, a robust Th1/Th2 type response against E6 but not E7 correlated with a lack of disease relapse and/or infection recurrence but did not discriminate between HPV-18-positive and HPV-18-negative patients. Collectively, our data suggest different roles for anti-HPV-18 E6 and E7 CD4(+) T cells in anti-viral and anti-tumour immunity.

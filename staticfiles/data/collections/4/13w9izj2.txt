A transverse sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) not easily accessible by standard transfemoral (transarterial or transvenous) endovascular approaches is presented. An enlarged transosseous retromastoid foramen harboring the occipital artery branch feeding the lesion was identified on CT angiogram (CTA). Curative Onyx embolization was achieved via percutaneous CT-guided direct puncture of the transosseous occipital arterial branch followed by microcatheter navigation through the needle distally towards the site of the fistula.

Abstract Appropriate precautions are critical to minimize damage to the body during recovery and removal from a scene and transit to the mortuary to allow for accurate interpretation of injury and the minimization of contamination. Many elements of the investigation may be affected by the way in which tasks are conducted. Members of numerous jurisdictions must all work together to ensure the best outcome both from a forensic point of view and also in preserving and respecting the dignity of the deceased. This chapter will outline the techniques necessary for preserving the body and associated evidence during transport, including specific considerations for different types of cases.

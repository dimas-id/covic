This Open Forum focuses on specific challenges, contingency planning considerations, and downstream impacts of COVID-19 on inpatient psychiatric care. COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that has been declared a pandemic. Challenges for inpatient psychiatry include risky close contact among staff and patients, space constraints, and structural barriers in care delivery. Nuanced considerations of five contingency planning strategies in response to COVID-19 are described, including COVID-19-specific precautions, visitor restrictions, physician workforce considerations, operational adjustments, and group therapy changes. Organized leadership and clear communication are identified as early priorities in pandemic response to minimize misinformation and address immediate challenges.

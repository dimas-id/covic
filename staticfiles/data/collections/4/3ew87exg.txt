Proteins are major executors of life processes, carrying out essential and nonessential functions inside and outside of the cell, in species ranging from simple unicellular organisms to mammals. Thus, not surprisingly, studies of structure and function of proteins span the entire spectrum of molecular biology and modern biomedical sciences in general. Due to historical reasons, protein science research in China was isolated and limited in scope until late 1970s. In the last two decades, China has seen an outburst of research activities, government initiatives, and aggregation of human talents in protein science research. This article provides an overview of major initiatives in research funding, investment in infrastructures, and research forces for protein science research in China.

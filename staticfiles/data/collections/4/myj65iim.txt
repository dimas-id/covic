BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy is being performed with increasing frequency in Australia for the treatment of morbid obesity. The aims of this study were to show that sleeve gastrectomy can be performed safely with a low rate of complications and effective short to medium term weight loss. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2009. RESULTS A total of 185 patients were treated with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) over a three-year period. The percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) was 47.2% at one year, 60.7% at two years and 66% at three years. There were no leaks; two staple line bleeds requiring reoperation via laparoscopy, one port site infection and one port site incisional hernia. There were no deaths. The average operating time was 111 min and the average hospital length of stay was 2.35 days. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be performed safely and with excellent weight loss. More long term follow up is required.

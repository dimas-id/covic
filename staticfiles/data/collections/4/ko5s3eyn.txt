In order to better understand the bovine breathing pattern, tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) were analyzed in 24 healthy cattle of different body weights (range: 37â€“660 kg) (Group A) and in 28 cattle suffering from the common respiratory diseases: verminous bronchitis (Group B); shipping fever (Group C); acute respiratory distress syndrome (Group D); respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (Group E); organophosphate poisoning (Group F); and necrotic laryngitis (Group G). Respiratory airflow and tidal volume were measured with a breathing mask-Fleisch pneumotachograph assembly. TBFVL were traced from these values using a computerized method. All the loop indices proposed by Amis and Kurpershoek (1986a) were calculated from 5 representative breathing cycles for each of the 52 animals. The TBFVL shapes and indices were relatively constant in most healthy cattle and were not correlated with the body size. When compared to normal values, animals with moderate respiratory syndromes (Groups B and C) had a more flattened shape to their TBFVL. On the other hand, in most cattle with severe respiratory pathologies (Groups D, F and G) expiration tended to be biphasic with the peak expiratory flow (PEF) occurring significantly later than in healthy animals. Both PEF and peak inspiratory flow were increased in all the pathological conditions. The TBFVL indices were more frequently and more severely changed during expiration than during inspiration.

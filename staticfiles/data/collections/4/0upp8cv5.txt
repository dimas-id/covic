SARS-CoV-2 is a novel RNA virus that infects cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor and is associated with an acute respiratory disease named COVID-19. It has been hypothesized that ACE2 expression can be increased by Ibuprofen leading to a higher risk for severe COVID-19 (1). Despite the reasonable mechanistic background and results from studies suggesting that Ibuprofen may be associated with complications of community-acquired pneumonia in children (2,3), there is no current evidence that this NSAID aggravates a SARS-CoV-2 infection in any age group.

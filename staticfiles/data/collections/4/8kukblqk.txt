Proteomics analysis of serum from patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may lead to novel biomarkers for prediction of disease and for patient monitoring. However, the serum proteome is highly sensitive to sample processing and before proteomics biomarker research serum cohorts should preferably be examined for potential bias between sample groups. SELDI-TOF MS protein profiling was used for preliminary evaluation of a biological-bank with 766 serum samples from 270 patients with T1D, collected at 18 different paediatric centers representing 15 countries in Europe and Japan over 2 years (2000-2002). Samples collected 1 (n = 270), 6 (n = 248), and 12 (n = 248) months after T1D diagnosis were grouped across centers and compared. The serum protein profiles varied with collection site and day of analysis; however, markers of sample processing were not systematically different between samples collected at different times after diagnosis. Three members of the apolipoprotein family increased with time in patient serum collected 1, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis (ANOVA, p<0.001). These results support the use of this serum cohort for further proteomic studies and illustrate the potential of high-throughput MALDI/SELDI-TOF MS protein profiling for evaluation of serum cohorts before proteomics biomarker research.

The use of stapling devices to manage vascular pedicles during hepatic surgery has been a significant advance in the field. However, insertion and application of the stapler in vascular dissection planes can be associated with injury to adjacent structures. We describe a five-step technique using a silicone Penrose drain to aid in the positioning of an endovascular stapling device to obtain vascular control during hepatectomy. The use is described here for hepatic vein management during right hepatectomy. The technique can be also used for other applications when transecting major vessels during major liver surgery. The use of this silicone Penrose-guided endovascular stapler technique is a simple, cost-effective maneuver that can be used to improve control and prevent vascular injury during the division of major vascular structures when performing hepatic surgery.

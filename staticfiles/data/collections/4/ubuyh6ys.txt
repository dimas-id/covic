Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). To date, no antiviral drug has been approved to treat EV71 infection. Due to the essential role that EV71 3 C protease (3C(pro)) plays in the viral life cycle, it is generally considered as a highly appealing target for antiviral drug development. In this study, we present a transgene-encoded biosensor that can accurately, sensitively and quantitatively report the proteolytic activity of EV71 3C(pro). This biosensor is based on the catalyzed activity of a pro–interleukin (IL)-1β-enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site-Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) fusion protein that we named i-3CS-GLuc. GLuc enzyme is inactive in the fusion protein because of aggregation caused by pro–IL-1β. However, the 3C(pro) of EV71 and other enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus can recognize and process the canonical enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site between pro–IL-1β and GLuc, thereby releasing and activating GLuc and resulting in increased luciferase activity. The high sensitivity, ease of use, and applicability as a transgene in cell-based assays of i-3CS-GLuc biosensor make it a powerful tool for studying viral protease proteolytic events in living cells and for achieving high-throughput screening of antiviral agents.

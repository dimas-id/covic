The avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) multi-epitope based peptide EpiC was found to be effective in inducing strong humoral and cellular responses against IBV. In this study, the gene EpiC was introduced into Lactococcus lactis NZ3900, and three recombinant strains expressing EpiC in intracellular and extracellular forms were constructed. SDS-PAGE and Western blot results indicated that EpiC was successfully expressed and had good immunoreactivity with chicken anti-IBV serum. Fusion of the signal pepitide gene SPusp45 and the nine-peptide LEISSTCDA encoding oligonucleotide to EpiC increased the secretion of EpiC, but reduced the total yields of EpiC. Oral immunization to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with recombinant strains induced significantly higher levels of humoral immune responses, and provided protection against lethal dose challenge by the IBV SAIBk strain. These results indicate that it is feasible to use L. lactis as an antigen delivery vehicle in developing oral vaccines against IBV infection.

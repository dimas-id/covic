Traditionally, vaginal hysterectomy and Manchester repair were the surgical approaches to treating uterine prolapse; however, both are associated with a relatively high subsequent vaginal vault recurrence. Laparoscopic uterine suspension is a new way of maintaining uterine support. Many women are keen to keep their uterus for a variety of reasons, including maintaining reproductive capability and the belief that the uterus, cervix, or both, may play a part of their gender identity. Non-removal of the uterus may retain functional (e.g. bowel, bladder and sexual) benefits. Therefore, the concept of uterine preservation for pelvic-organ prolapse has been of interest to pelvic-floor surgeons for many decades. In this review, we provide an overview of the available evidence on treating uterine prolapse surgically. We describe techniques to support the vault during hysterectomy, and examine the evidence for uterine-sparing surgery. Comparative outcomes for vaginal, abdominal and laparoscopic routes will be made.

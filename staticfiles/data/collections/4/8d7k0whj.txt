Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. Since its associated morbidity and mortality have been postulated to be due to immune dysregulation, we investigated which of the viral proteins is responsible for chemokine overexpression. To delineate the viral and cellular factor interactions, the role of four SARS coronavirus proteins, including nonstructural protein 1 (nsp-1), nsp-5, envelope, and membrane, were examined in terms of cytokine induction. Our results showed that the SARS coronavirus nsp-1 plays an important role in CCL5, CXCL10, and CCL3 expression in human lung epithelial cells via the activation of NF-kappaB.

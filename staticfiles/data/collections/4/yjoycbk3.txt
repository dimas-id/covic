In a chirped pulse experiment, the strength of the signal level is proportional to the amplitude of the electric field, which is weaker in the millimeter-wave or submillimeter-wave region than in the microwave region. Experiments in the millimeter region thus require an optimization of the coupling between the source and the molecular system and a method to estimate the amplitude of the electric field as seen by the molecular system. We have developed an analytical model capable of reproducing the coherent transient signals obtained with a millimeter-wave chirped pulse setup operated in a monochromatic pulse mode. The fit of the model against the experimental data allowed access to the amplitude of the electric field and, as a byproduct, to the molecular relaxation times T(1) and T(2).

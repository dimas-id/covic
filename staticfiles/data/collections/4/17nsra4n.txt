External inflammatory root resorption after luxation injury is a frequent complication. This article describes a case of extensive external root resorption in the middle third of the root of a maxillary right incisor. Root canal treatment was performed followed by surgical intervention. The resorptive defect was debrided and part of the root was repaired with resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Postoperative follow-up revealed complete healing.

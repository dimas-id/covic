Abstract The effect of duration of feeding (continuous or discontinued after d 14) and form (granular vs. powder) of spray-dried plasma (SDP) on performance and mortality of broilers using used litter was evaluated with 240 Ross Ã— Ross 308 male broilers (6 broilers per pen, 8 pens per treatment). Dietary treatments were control (no SDP) or SDP as powder or granular included in the pellet and fed continuously (d 0 to 35) or discontinued after d 14. During the experiment, broilers developed necrotic enteritis, and tissue cultures were positive for Escherichia coli and Salmonella, resulting in 50% mortality on control broilers. Addition of SDP to the feed improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency for each period of the study (d 0 to 14, 15 to 28, 29 to 35, and 0 to 35). Continuous feeding of SDP improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency from d 15 to 35 compared with broilers fed SDP to d 14. Liveability was improved (P < 0.05) in broilers consuming SDP either for 14 d or continuously throughout the experiment compared with control broilers. Spray-dried granular plasma was more effective than spray-dried powder plasma from d 0 to 14. The results of this experiment confirmed that SDP improved broiler growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency, and minimized enteric challenge associated with necrotic enteritis with maximal protection afforded by continuous feeding. The response to SDP was independent of age of the broiler.

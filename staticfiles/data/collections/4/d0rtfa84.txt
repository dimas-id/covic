Blood filters have been available since the 1930s. In this review we evaluate the role of microaggregate filters (MF) in certain transfusion complications, namely non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reactions (NHFTR), pulmonary injury, thrombocytopenia, fibronectin depletion and histamine release. We review the latest generation of leucocyte depleting filters and discuss their role in preventing alloimmunisation, immunosuppression and CMV transmission. Finally, we provide a rationale for the role of blood microfiltration in the present day practice of intensive care medicine.

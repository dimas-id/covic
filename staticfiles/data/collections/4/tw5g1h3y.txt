They have been created based on world publications and recommendations due to the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic. Justification for suspension of planned provision of services in the first phase of a pandemic was presented. The indication of the best medical practices for the time of stabilization, but with the persistence of the risk of COVID-19 infection in the population are discussed.

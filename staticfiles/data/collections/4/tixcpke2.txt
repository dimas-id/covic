PURPOSE To demonstrate the feasibility and potential utility of high-resolution angioscopy during common endovascular interventions. METHODS A 3.7-F scanning fiber angioscope was used in 6 Yorkshire pigs to image branch vessel selection, subintimal dissection, wire snaring, and stent placement. The angioscope was introduced in a coaxial fashion within a standard 6-F guide catheter. A clear field of view was provided using continuous heparinized saline flush through the outer guide catheter. The flush flow rate was manually adjusted to provide clear imaging depending on the diameter of the vessel and local blood flow conditions. RESULTS The scanning fiber angioscope was compatible with off-the-shelf catheters and devices commonly used in peripheral and aortic interventions. Video-rate, high-resolution images were obtained during all the interventions tested and provided information that was complementary to simultaneously acquired fluoroscopy. The scanning fiber angioscope was able to detect subintimal dissection and branch vessel stent coverage with higher resolution than fluoroscopy alone. CONCLUSION Endoluminal imaging with the scanning fiber angioscope is feasible with current endovascular devices and provides additional relevant information that cannot be assessed fluoroscopically. The scanning fiber angioscope represents a novel optical platform on which new endovascular techniques may be developed that will minimize radiation and contrast doses for patients.

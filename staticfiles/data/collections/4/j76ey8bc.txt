Ten breeding sows were left in direct contact with their newborn piglets that had been experimentally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus. All sows became infected with the virus. The sows developed fever and showed mild clinical signs of the disease for a few days. The sows excreted virus in the nasal secretion, feces, and milk during the acute febrile phase of illness. Virus was isolated from the nasal secretion of one sow as early as 20 hours after contact exposure to the infected piglets. At necropsy, the virus was more frequently isolated from the tissues of the upper respiratory tract than from small intestines; this finding indicated that the TGE coronavirus replicated in the upper respiratory tract and induced an acute respiratory infection in susceptible adult swine. Neutralizing antibody was present in the sera 8 sows after 12 to 36 days during the convalescent period. From these results, we conclude that susceptible sows in direct contact with ill piglets can become infected and by excreting virus can serve as a source of TGE virus for other susceptible pigs on the premises.

PURPOSE To report our single-center experience with the chimney technique for aortic arch pathologies and the mid- to long-term results in these patients. METHODS From June 2002 to May 2013, 26 patients (18 men; mean age 71.2 years, 53-86) underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) combined with chimney technique. Indications for treatment were: a proximal landing zone <15 mm long distal to the left subclavian artery (LSA), thoracic aortic aneurysm (n=13), complicated type B aortic dissection (n=10), type I endoleak after previous TEVAR (n=2), and penetrating aortic ulcer (n=1). Treatment was performed in the emergency setting in 7 cases. The 28 chimney stent-grafts (double chimneys in 2 patients) were deployed in the innominate artery (n=7), left common carotid artery (n=10), and LSA (n=11). All patients underwent computed tomography before discharge, at 1, 6, and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. RESULTS Technical success was 100%. One (3.8%) perioperative death was due to a cerebral hemorrhage. No major stroke was registered, but 3 (11.5%) minor strokes occurred (all resolved). Paraparesis developed in 2 (7.7%) patients. Median follow-up was 36.8 months (range 1-131), during which an additional 4 (15.4%) patients died, but only 1 death was aneurysm-related. Chimney graft patency was 89.3% (25/28); an asymptomatic fracture was found in a patent chimney stent-graft at the 18-month follow-up. The type I endoleak rate was 23% (n=6); 3 endoleaks associated with aneurysm sac enlargement were treated. CONCLUSION The chimney technique for aortic arch pathologies is safe and feasible and may be an option in patients considered at high risk for surgery or who are ineligible for conventional TEVAR, especially in the emergency setting. Concern persists regarding type I endoleak, and long-term follow-up remains mandatory.

PURPOSE Parastomal hernias (PSHs) have been a major clinical problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new method of PSH repair in combination with an additional flat mesh reinforcement of the abdominal wall. METHODS In a pilot case series, seven patients suffering from complex PSHs (â‰¥5 cm diameter and/or recurrence) underwent surgery and were treated by intraperitoneal onlay technique (IPOM) with a synthetic 3-D funnel-shaped mesh implant. The demographics, perioperative, and follow-up data are presented in this report. RESULTS The surgical strategy varied between purely laparoscopic (n = 1), laparoscopically assisted (hybrid n = 3), or open techniques (n = 3) using original or suture-reconstructed mesh devices. The funnel mesh implantations in IPOM technique were combined with attached flat meshes in the appropriate position of the abdominal wall. No procedure-related complications occurred. The mean length of hospital stay was 12 days and the mean operating time was 171 min. No recurrence of PSH or incisional hernias was observed during a mean follow-up period of 12.3 months (range from 7 to 22). CONCLUSION The use of a 3-D mesh implant has so far shown to be a promising option in the treatment of primary and recurrent PSHs. Its use proved to be reasonable in both laparoscopic and open IPOM technique. PSHs were preferably repaired using the original, unmodified implant, but when we also found it safe to incise, place and then suture the mesh around the pre-existing ostomy.

Quantum computing aims to provide algorithms and hardware that allows for solving computational problems asymptotically faster than on classical computers. Yet, design of new, fast quantum algorithms is not straightforward, and the field faces high barriers of entry for traditional computer scientists. One of the main didactic examples used to introduce speedup resulting from quantum computing is the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for discriminating between constant and balanced functions. Here, we show a generalization of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm beyond balanced functions that can be used to further illustrate the design choices underpinning quantum algorithms.

Summary PoSeiDon is an easy-to-use pipeline that helps researchers to find recombination events and sites under positive selection in protein-coding sequences. By entering homologous sequences, PoSeiDon builds an alignment, estimates a best-fitting substitution model, and performs a recombination analysis followed by the construction of all corresponding phylogenies. Finally, significantly positive selected sites are detected according to different models for the full alignment and possible recombination fragments. The results of PoSeiDon are summarized in a user-friendly HTML page providing all intermediate results and the graphical representation of recombination events and positively selected sites. Availability and implementation PoSeiDon is freely available at https://github.com/hoelzer/poseidon. The pipeline is implemented in Nextflow with Docker support and processes the output of various tools. Contact hoelzer.martin@gmail.com

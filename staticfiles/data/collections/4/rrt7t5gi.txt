In 1955, Allen and Masters describe a painful syndrome which associates traumatic delivery to laceration found on the posterior leaf of the broad ligament. Herniation through this defect is a rare entity, accounted for about 4-7% of all internal hernias. Normally, it involves the small bowel. The authors present the case of a multiparous woman admitted at emergency for constipation and abdominal pain. The CT scan showed an extremely rare case of internal hernia of the sigmoid colon, fallopian tube and left ovary through a large defect of the broad ligament. The patient underwent a full laparoscopic surgery that allowed the reduction of the hernia and the suture of the defect with very good outcome.

BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE The use of flow-diverting stents has gained acceptance during the past few years for the treatment of numerous intracranial aneurysms, especially large or giant ones. However, successful catheterization of the distal parent artery in giant intracranial aneurysms with a microcatheter can be extremely challenging. Forming a microcatheter loop in the aneurysm sac can aid distal catheterization. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We report the use of a Solitaire FR stent as an adjunctive tool in the successful treatment of 2 giant intracranial unruptured aneurysms with a Pipeline Embolization Device. After having formed a loop inside the aneurysm sac, the microcatheter was anchored distally by a Solitaire FR stent. With the Solitaire FR device opened, the loop in the giant aneurysm sac was completely reduced without loss of the microcatheter position in the distal parent artery. A Pipeline Embolization Device could be delivered in both cases without any difficulty. There were no complications. CONCLUSION The technique described results in ideal microcatheter alignment with a secure distal position before deployment of a flow-diverting stent.

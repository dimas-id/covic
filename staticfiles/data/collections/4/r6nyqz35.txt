We appreciated the response to our letter from Dr. Zhang and colleagues who actively support D‐dimer level at admission as an effective and easy‐to‐perform laboratory predictor in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) (1). We congratulate them for the work and thank them for the arguments they have provided. However, we still have many doubts, which observation of the cases we have managed in our university hospital do not dispel.

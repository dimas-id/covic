Less than 1% of patients with liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are susceptible to liver transplantation. We report a case of a patient transplanted 13 years ago for NET metastases, with a lesion histologically proved for NET metastasis located at the cava vein anastomosis. He was treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) after a first failed attempt of endovascular approach. The vascular heat sink, which RFA is susceptible to, was considered an advantage in this case, since it restricted the propagation of heat only to the tissue located in the very proximity of the RFA antenna, protecting the inferior vena cava vessel walls. This positive result may suggest an additional use of RFA in selected challenging cases.

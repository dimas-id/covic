Picornaviruses are small animal viruses with positive-strand genomic RNA, which is translated using cap-independent internal translation initiation. The key role in this is played by ciselements of the 5"-untranslated region (5"-UTR) and, in particular, by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The function of translational ciselements requires both canonical translation initiation factors (eIFs) and additional IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). All known ITAFs are cell RNA-binding proteins which play a variety of functions in noninfected cells. Specific features of translational ciselements substantially affect the phenotype and, in particular, tissue tropism and pathogenic properties of picornaviruses. It is clear that, in some cases, the molecular mechanism involved is a change in interactions between viral ciselements and ITAFs. The properties and tissue distribution of ITAFs may determine the biological properties of other viruses that also use the IRES-dependent translation initiation. Since this mechanism is also involved in translation of several cell mRNAs, ITAF may contribute to the regulation of the most important aspects of the living activity in noninfected cells.

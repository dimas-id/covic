Abstract: Viruses are common causes of foodborne outbreaks. Viral diseases have low fatality rates but transmission to humans via food is important due to the high probability of consuming fecally contaminated food or water because of poor food handling. Because of the low infectious doses of some foodborne viruses, there is a need for standardization and the development of new sensitive methods for detecting viruses. The focus is on molecular and non-molecular approaches, and emerging methods for the detection of foodborne viruses. The detection of noroviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses, rotaviruses and adenoviruses will be discussed. The chapter will conclude with insights into future research directions.

Fusion of biological membranes is governed by physical principles but it is unclear whether the transition states are primarily determined by lipid physics or by protein-lipid interactions. Recent advances in the field include the physical description of bilayer fusion, particularly new models beyond continuum models and the role of the SNARE proteins. Despite substantial progress, an integrated concept for protein-mediated membrane fusion is not yet available, and many open questions remain to be answered.

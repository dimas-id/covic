A patient underwent surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. SARS- CoV-2 was positive. The postoperative course was complicated by a mixed viral/bacterial pneumonia with bilateral infiltration, treated with antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine, without any need for reintubation. The patient recovered and finally could be dismissed. This report shows feasibility for surgical treatment of acute aortic disease in patients with COVID-19.

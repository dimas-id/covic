Background Increasing evidence suggests that kyphoscoliosis may play a role in the pathophysiology of paraesophageal hernia development. The presence of severe kyphoscoliosis not only increases the incidence of paraesophageal hernia but also increases the risk of hiatal hernia (HH) repair. Moreover, the technical skills and the pitfalls of laparoscopic repair of HH in this special condition have yet been described. Methods The technical skills, experience and pitfalls of laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients were described. These include perioperative care of patients' pulmonary function, patients' operating position and trocar placement, and the key steps and risks of laparoscopic HH repair in this special condition. Results Paraesophageal HHs were successfully laparoscopically repaired, and prolonged hospital stay was due to post-operative pulmonary complications. Conclusion These techniques are essential to minimise the perioperative complications in laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients, and great pulmonary care is required in these patients.

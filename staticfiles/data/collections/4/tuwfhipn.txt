Difficult airway management and intraoperative tube damage are important problems during maxillofacial surgery. Damage occurs frequently during the surgery, and the anesthesiologist must be ready to find a quick and safe solution. Replacing the damaged endotracheal tube involves additional difficulties, and various factors must be evaluated. We present two cases of nasotracheal tube (NTT) damage suffered during maxillofacial surgery. The different intraoperative conditions led us to decide for the replacement of NTT in one case and for conservative action in the other. The purpose of this article is to highlight the difficulties that the anesthesiologist may have in deciding quickly what is the best approach in case the endotracheal tube is damaged during maxillofacial surgery and possibly try to provide a rapid and safe solution for the situation.

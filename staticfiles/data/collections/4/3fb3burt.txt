Background The subcategory "solid component of tumor" is a new criterion of tumor categories in the updated eighth edition of the TNM classification. Nevertheless, the predictors of lymph node metastasis among patients with clinical T1 adenocarcinoma, based on the TNM classification 8th edition, remain unclear. This study aimed to identify the preoperative predictors of lymph node metastasis in clinical T1 adenocarcinoma by comparing clinicopathological characteristics between the groups with and without lymph node metastasis. Methods We performed a retrospective observational single-center study at the Sendai Kousei Hospital. From January 2012 to September 2019, we included 515 patients who underwent curative lobectomy or segmentectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection among those with clinical T1 adenocarcinoma according to the UICC-TNM staging 8th edition. They were divided into two groups: those with lymph node metastasis (positive group) and those without (negative group). The clinicopathological factors were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the groups. Results In univariate analysis, carcinoembryonic antigen (>5.0 ng/mL) (P=0.0007), maximum standardized uptake (>3.5) (P<0.0001), clinical T factor (T1c) (P<0.0001), and consolidation tumor ratio (>0.85) (P<0.0001) were significant predictors of lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis revealed that maximum standardized uptake SUVmax (>3.5) (odds ratio =10.4, P<0.0001) was independently associated with lymph node metastasis. In univariate analysis, carcinoembryonic antigen (>5.0) (P=0.048) was the only predictor of lymph node metastasis among patients of cT1b, while no parameters were identified as significant predictors among patients of cT1c. Conclusions SUVmax and CEA are useful preoperative predictors of lymph node metastases in patients with clinical T1 adenocarcinoma, stratified to T1b and T1c, based on the 8th TNM classification.

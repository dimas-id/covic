With the outbreak of pandemic COVID-19, protection of public and health workers has become a national priority. In this regard, it is desirable to study the coughing- and sneezing-generated pathogen aerosols, its dispersion and transportation in isolation rooms, clinics, confined spaces and other general public places to evolve efficient ventilation system along with suitable protective measures to limit the spread of the virus. The present paper describes the overall experimental scheme supported with computational fluid dynamics evaluation to address this problem for evolution of optimal ventilation system using the National Aerosol Facility at IIT Kanpur set up in collaboration with BARC Trombay. The outcome of this study is aimed to evolve a national standard for optimum isolation rooms that would provide adequate protection to health workers.

Modern day datasets continue to increase in both size and diversity. One example of such 'big data' is video data. Within the medical arena, more disciplines are using video as a diagnostic tool. Given the large amount of data stored within a video image, it is one of most time consuming types of data to process and analyse. Therefore, it is desirable to have automated techniques to extract, process and analyse data from video images. While many methods have been developed for extracting and processing video data, statistical modelling to analyse the outputted data has rarely been employed. We develop a method to take a video sequence of periodic nature, extract the RGB data and model the changes occurring across the contiguous images. We employ harmonic regression to model periodicity with autoregressive terms accounting for the error process associated with the time series nature of the data. A linear spline is included to account for movement between frames. We apply this model to video sequences of retinal vessel pulsation, which is the pulsatile component of blood flow. Slope and amplitude are calculated for the curves generated from the application of the harmonic model, providing clinical insight into the location of obstruction within the retinal vessels. The method can be applied to individual vessels, or to smaller segments such as 2 Ã— 2 pixels which can then be interpreted easily as a heat map.

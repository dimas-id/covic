An immunosuppressed 61-year-old man went to the hospital with fever, nonproductive cough, and increasing shortness of breath. The subject died 8 days later of respiratory complications. PCR of respiratory samples as well as a blood sample revealed exceptionally high DNA levels of the emerging pathogen, human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), a recently found pathogen associated with respiratory symptoms in young children. We describe the clinical progression of the case and discuss the potential role of HBoV1 in the outcome.

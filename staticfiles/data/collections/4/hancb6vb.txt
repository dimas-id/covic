While many epidemiological models have being proposed to understand and handle COVID-19, too little has been invested to understand how the virus replicates in the human body and potential antiviral can be used to control the replication cycle. In this work, using a control theoretical approach, validated mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 in humans are properly characterized. A complete analysis of the main dynamic characteristic is developed based on the reproduction number. The equilibrium regions of the system are fully characterized, and the stability of such a regions, formally established. Mathematical analysis highlights critical conditions to decrease monotonically SARS-CoV-2 in the host, such conditions are relevant to tailor future antiviral treatments. Simulation results show the potential benefits of the aforementioned system characterization.

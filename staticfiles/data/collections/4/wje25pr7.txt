The Damageâ€“Response Framework (DRF) is a powerful tool to inform research in infectious diseases. It can integrate clinical observation with microbiology and immunology to incorporate the role of the host response into the outcome of microbial pathogenesis. Although the role that microbial factors may play in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases is well recognized, the DRF brings the indispensable role of the host response to the fore. For example, inflammation may induce microbial control, but it can also produce host damage. On the other hand, insufficient inflammation may fail to induce sufficient microbial control. Each scenario may lead to the diagnosis of an infectious disease. Given the central role that the host response plays in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, new strategies for treatment need to consider the nature of the host response as well as microbial factors.

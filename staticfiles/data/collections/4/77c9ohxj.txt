Abstract Humans swallow a great variety and often large amounts of chemicals as nutrients, incidental food additives and contaminants, drugs, and inhaled particles and chemicals, thus exposing the gastrointestinal tract to many potentially toxic substances. It serves as a barrier in many cases to protect other components of the body from such substances and infections. Fortunately, the gastrointestinal tract is remarkably robust and generally is able to withstand multiple daily assaults by the chemicals to which it is exposed. Some chemicals, however, can affect one or more aspects of the gastrointestinal tract to produce abnormal events that reflect toxicity. It is the purpose of this chapter to evaluate the mechanisms by which toxic chemicals produce their deleterious effects and to determine the consequences of the toxicity on integrity of gastrointestinal structure and function. Probably because of the intrinsic ability of the gastrointestinal tract to resist toxic chemicals, there is a paucity of data regarding gastrointestinal toxicology. It is therefore necessary in many cases to extrapolate toxic mechanisms from infectious processes, inflammatory conditions, ischemia, and other insults in addition to more conventional chemical sources of toxicity.

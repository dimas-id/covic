In this special section of BioTechniques, we examine the role of rapid molecular technologies in the detection and identification of agents of infectious disease (ID) and biological weapons (BWs). Besides the threat posed by the global proliferation of BW technologies, there are numerous emerging and reemerging ID agents with significant public health consequences. Further compounding this already complicated situation are the estimated 600 million international tourists annually, many with the potential to the spread disease globally in a matter of hours. While clinical laboratories have key roles in the detection and identification of potential ID/BW agents, most staff are unfamiliar with these agents because of their rarity and the often laborious conventional methodologies needed to identify them. To meet this challenge, a vast array of rapid assay strategies has been developed for use in clinical diagnostics and environmental detection. Technologies have been developed or adapted to the challenges posed by these agents, permitting detection and identification in several minutes to hours. In particular, the development of improved reagents and detection systems has led to dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of immunological and nucleic acid-based systems, allowing an ever-increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantitated. In the accompanying articles, we have brought together experts from the many overlapping aspects of this arena in order to present a comprehensive and critical analysis of these technologies.

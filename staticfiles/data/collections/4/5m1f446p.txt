Bladder migration of a Hem-o-lok® clip, due to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), is uncommon, and would form a foreign body in the bladder and present as lower urinary tract symptoms after the early postoperative period. We hereby report a rare, delayed appearance of a secondary bladder stone due to the migration of a Hem-o-lok® clip that occurred 5 years after RARP.

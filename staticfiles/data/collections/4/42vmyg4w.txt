BACKGROUND Polyurethane-coated conical implants were introduced by Silimed (US distributor: Sientra, Santa Barbara, California) in 2008 and offer an alternative to round or anatomically shaped implants. By their design and volume distribution, they naturally create central volume and give a reasonable fullness to the upper pole while lifting some ptotic breasts, thus avoiding the need for classical mastopexy. OBJECTIVES The authors discuss the advantages of conical implants as an alternative to conventional silicone implants for women with breast ptosis. METHODS In the 2-year period between December 2010 and December 2012, a consecutive series of 302 women underwent implant-based breast surgery procedures (236 primary augmentations, 59 revisions, and 7 mastopexy-augmentations) with conical polyurethane devices. Implant volumes ranged from 225 to 560 cc, with low- to medium-profile devices predominating. No extra-high-profile implants were used. Only 1 patient had a drain inserted on completion of a revision augmentation. RESULTS There were no infections (0%) and no wound dehiscence (0%). Four cases required reoperation (1.3%). Patient satisfaction scores were universally high (average, 9.94/10). There have been no capsular contractures to date, but follow-up is short. CONCLUSION The modern conical, polyurethane implant has many advantages over the conventional round or anatomically shaped implants and offers patients an ideal compromise between volume, natural upper pole fullness, and a lift without mastopexy scars.

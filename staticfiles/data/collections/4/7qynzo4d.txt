This is the first successful report of a laparoscope-assisted Hassab's operation for esophagogastric varices after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). A 35-year-old man underwent LDLT using a right lobe graft as an aid for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in 2005. Follow-up endoscopic and computed tomography (CT) examinations showed esophagogastric varices with splenomegaly in 2009 that increased (esophageal varices [EV]: locus superior [Ls], moderator enlarged, beady varices [F2], medium in number and intermediate between localized and circumferential red color signs [RC2]; gastric varices [GV]: extension from the cardiac orifice to the fornix [Lg-cf], moderator enlarged, beady varices [F2], absent red color signs [RC0]). A portal venous flow to the esophagogastric varices through a large left gastric vein was also confirmed. Preoperative Child-Pugh was grade B and score was 9. Because these esophagogastric varices had a high risk of variceal bleeding, we proceeded with a laparoscope-assisted Hassab's operation. Operative time was 464 minutes. Blood loss was 1660 mL. A graft liver biopsy was also performed and recurrence of PSC was confirmed histologically. It was suggested that portal hypertension and esophagogastric varices were caused by recurrence of PSC. Postoperative complications were massive ascites and enteritis. Both of them were treated successfully. This patient was discharged on postoperative day 43. Follow-up endoscopic study showed improvement in the esophagogastric varices (esophageal varices [EV]: locus superior [Ls], no varicose appearance [F0], absent red color signs [RC0], gastric varices [GV]: adjacent to the cardiac orifice [Lg-c], no varicose appearance [F0], absent red color signs [RC0]) at 6 months after the operation. We also confirmed the improvement of esophagogastric varices by serial examinations of CT.

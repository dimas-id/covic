Abstract The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of cells from colostrum on the health of neonate calves. Animals were distributed in 2 groups: COL+ (n =9) which received fresh colostrum from their own damns; and COL− (n =10) which received frozen colostrums from donors. Heifers were assessed before colostrum intake – D0; D2; D7; D14; D21 and D28. Heifers were monitored by clinical examination, hematological profile and serum iron. COL− had a higher diarrhea intensity score (typically 3) on D7. Moreover, a single case each of bronchopneumonia and navel inflammation were observed in COL− calves. COL− had fewer red blood cells (RBC) (6.5±0.8×106/μL) and less hemoglobin (Hgb) (8.3±1.4g/dL) than COL+ (RBC=7.2±0.8×106/μL; Hgb=9.6±1.3g/dL) at D14 (P ≤0.05). COL− had more anemia on D21 (P =0.03) and on D28 (P =0.02). Iron was lower in COL− (5.6±2.7μM/L) than COL+ (10.7±6.2μM/L) (P =0.03) on D7. Lymphocytes was lower in COL− than COL+ on D7 (3.8±1.0×103/μL COL+ and 5.4±2.2×103/μL COL−, P =0.02). COL− calves had more anemia and lower serum iron concomitant with diarrhea on D7. The number of leukocytes was relatively consistent in the COL+ calves, while COL− calves showed an increasing number of of lymphocytes starting on D7.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic swept across the world, altering the structure and existence of graduate medical education programs across all disciplines. Orthopaedic residency programs can adapt during these unprecedented times to continue providing meaningful education to trainees, and to continue providing high-quality patient care, all while keeping both residents and patients safe from disease. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the literature and describe evidence-based changes that can be taken to an orthopaedic residency program to ensure patient and resident safety, sustaining the principles of graduate medical education, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe measures which can be enacted now or with future pandemics, including workforce and occupational modifications, personal protective equipment, telemedicine, online didactic education, resident wellness, return to elective surgery and factors affecting medical students and fellows. After a review of these strategies, programs can make changes for sustainable improvements and adapt to be ready for second wave events or future pandemics.

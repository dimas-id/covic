It is important to locate important context words in the sentences and model them appropriately to perform event detection (ED) effectively. This has been mainly achieved by some fixed word selection strategy in the previous studies for ED. In this work, we propose a novel method that learns to select relevant context words for ED based on the Gumbel-Softmax trick. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, leading to the state-of-the-art performance for ED over different benchmark datasets and settings.

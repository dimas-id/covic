The use of absorbable sutures to obtain secure dermal closure in surgeries such as body contouring is common. The risk of complications based on the absorption rate of these materials is unknown. This study attempts to determine whether a faster absorbing suture material such as polyglytone 6211 will lead to fewer complications such as extrusion and granuloma formation as compared with less rapidly absorbing materials such as poliglecaprone 25. Concomitantly, this study also attempts to explore the possible negative outcomes that may be due to faster loss of strength, such as dehiscence and poor scar aesthetics. We found that extrusion occurs less frequently with the rapidly absorbed polyglytone 6211 suture material, without increase in granuloma formation, infection, dehiscence, cellulitis, necrosis, seroma formation, and hematoma formation. We also observed no clinical difference in the cosmetic appearance of scars at the 12-week postoperative follow-up visit.

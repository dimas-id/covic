The aim was to investigate if intraoperative registrations of blood pressure and heart rate could be used to estimate surgical trauma. In a prospective clinical trial, registrations in eight dogs neutered by laparoscopic ovariectomy (LOE) were compared with eight dogs subjected to open ovariohysterectomy (OHE). For comparisons phases were used: phase zero=steady state after induction of anaesthesia; phase one=opening of abdomen; phase two=severing of ovarian pedicles; and, phase three=abdominal closure. During LOE, mean systolic blood pressure increased by 7 mmHg (p=0.05) and 15 mmHg (p=0.01) from phase zero to phase one and two, respectively, and during OHE by 3 mmHg (ns) and 29 mmHg (p<0.0001), respectively. The increase from phase one to phase two differed between groups (p=0.03). Heart rate did not change. Frequent intraoperative measurements of blood pressure appear a promising method for evaluating surgical trauma.

Technological innovations and novel applications have greatly advanced the field of protein microarrays. Over the past two years, different types of protein microarrays have been used for serum profiling, protein abundance determinations, and identification of proteins that bind DNA or small compounds. However, considerable development is still required to ensure common quality standards and to establish large content repertoires. Here, we summarize applications available to date and discuss recent technological achievements and efforts on standardization.

INTRODUCTION The incidence of prostate cancer is increasing, and inguinal hernias are common in the age group of men with prostate cancer. Furthermore, inguinal hernias are now considered to be one of the long-term complications of radical prostatectomy. In this report, we present our experience with the performance of totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) along with extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (ELRP). PRESENTATION OF CASE A 66-year-old man with prostate cancer and bilateral inguinal hernias was admitted to our hospital for surgery. He had a history of right inguinal hernioplasty without mesh placement and ascending colon diverticulitis. With a diagnosis of prostate cancer and bilateral inguinal hernia, concomitant TEP after ELRP was safely performed. DISCUSSION TEP combined with ELRP appears to be a rational procedure and easy to perform. The incidence of complications related to either TEP or ELRP might not be increased. TEP combined with ELRP might be safely performed for recurrent inguinal hernia after non-mesh hernioplasty. CONCLUSION TEP combined with ELRP might be of use in prostate cancer patients with inguinal hernias.

This review article presents the fifth part (part E) in the series of stories on antiviral drug discovery. The ten stories belonging to this fifth part are dealing with (i) aurintricarboxylic acid; (ii) alkenyldiarylmethanes; (iii) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase inhibitors; (iv) lens epithelium‐derived growth factor as a potential target for HIV proviral DNA integration; (v) the status presens of neuraminidase inhibitors NAIs in the control of influenza virus infections; (vi) the status presens on respiratory syncytial virus inhibitors; (vii) tricyclic (1,N‐2‐ethenoguanine)‐based acyclovir and ganciclovir derivatives; (viii) glycopeptide antibiotics as antivirals targeted at viral entry; (ix) the potential (off‐label) use of cidofovir in the treatment of polyoma (JC and BK) virus infections; and (x) finally, thymidine phosphorylase as a target for both antiviral and anticancer agents. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

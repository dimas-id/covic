When Jean Todt became Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) president in 2009, he made good use of the Mosley legacy. At the same time, he engineered a series of new reforms that would mark the greatest difference between the old and the new FIA. This chapter explores a selection of organisational innovations during Todt’s three presidential periods (2009–2021). This selection includes two presidential elections in 2009 and 2013 which had a hitherto unrivalled emphasis on good governance, a political debacle (the F1 Bahrain Grand Prix), a structural revamp (the establishing the FIA Statutes Review), the introduction of an external audit (aided by consulting firm, Deloitte), and a proactive media strategy to comprehend a media logic (by publishing AUTO magazine from 2012 onwards). Together, this combination of substantive and symbolic actions represents the FIA’s desire to renew its legitimacy among its members, motorists, and other stakeholders.

AIM To obtain the information of protein-protein interaction between the SARS-CoV proteins and caveolin-1, identify the possible caveolin-binding sites in SARS-CoV proteins. METHODS On the basis of three related caveolin-binding motifs, amino acid motif search was employed to predict the possible caveolin-1 related interaction domains in the SARS-CoV proteins. The molecular modeling and docking simulation methods were used to confirm the interaction between caveolin-1 and SARS-CoV proteins. RESULTS Thirty six caveolin-binding motifs in the SARS-CoV proteins have been mapped out using bioinformatics analysis tools. Molecular modeling and simulation have confirmed 8 caveolin-binding sites. These caveolin-binding sites located in replicase 1AB, spike protein, orf3 protein, and M protein, respectively. CONCLUSION Caveolin-1 may serve as a possible receptor of the SARS-CoV proteins, which may be associated with the SARS-CoV infection, replication, assembly, and budding.

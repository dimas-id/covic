Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is one of the major causes of reproductive pig disease. Due to its serious nature, wide spread and consequent great damage to the swine industry, an effective, rapid and convenient method for its detection is needed. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect PPV infection. Two pairs of primers were specifically designed to recognize the six different sequences of open reading frame1 (ORF1) gene. The optimized LAMP program was as follows: 50 min at 59 °C followed by 3 min at 80 °C.The amplified products were analyzed both by visual inspection after staining with SYBR Green I dye and by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. Both methods showed the same sensitivity. The limit of detection (LOD) for PPV by LAMP was 10 copies, which is 100-fold lower than conventional PCR. Our LAMP assay did not cross-react with other viruses. We used the established LAMP system to test 1100 field samples and detected 660 positives. The LAMP detection method for PPV represents a visual, sensitive and rapid assay which can detect the virus in the field, offering an attractive alternative for the PPV detection methods currently in use.

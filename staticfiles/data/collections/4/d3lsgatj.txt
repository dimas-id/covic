The authors estimated the true number of COVID-19 infected people in Japan using the LINE questionnaire data and the PCR test results. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the infection rate per prefecture with PCR test and the rate of high fever. Using this correlation, true number of COVID-19 infected people in Japan was estimated approximately twenty thousand (+/âˆ’ ten thousand) as of April 1, 2020.

In a recent paper (arXiv:2003.12055), Singh and Adhikari present results of an analysis of a mathematical model of epidemiology based on which they argue that a $49$ day lockdown is required in India for containing the pandemic in India. We assert that as a model study with the stated assumptions, the analysis presented in the paper is perfectly valid, however, any serious comparison with real data and attempts at prediction from the model are highly problematic. The main point of the present paper is to convincingly establish this assertion while providing a warning that the results and analysis of such mathematical models should not be taken at face value and need to be used with great caution by policy makers.

Viral infections can influence both the development and the severity of asthma. In early life, viral infections can either increase or, remarkably, decrease the risk of subsequent asthma. In children and adults with existing asthma, viral respiratory infections frequently cause acute airway obstruction and wheezing. This article discusses the influence of viral infections on mechanisms of virus-induced airway inflammation in relationship to the development, persistence and severity of asthma.

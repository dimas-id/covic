Although a variety of techniques have been used to manage the distal ureter during laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy (LNU), a consensus has not yet been established. Recently, some authors have used a single-port transvesical approach to excise the distal ureter and bladder cuff following LNU. The aim of the study was to present our initial experience in "en bloc" dissection of the distal ureter and bladder cuff during LNU, using a transvesical single-port approach (T-LESS) and standard laparoscopic instruments. From April to October 2012, 5 patients aged 45 to 73 years with upper urinary tract urothelial tumors were subjected to LNU/T-LESS. After a standard LNU was performed, a TriPort+(®) device was introduced into the bladder and the pneumovesicum was established. A bladder cuff with a distal ureter was dissected and put in the paravesical tissue. The bladder wall defect was closed with the V-loc(®) 3/0 suture. The LNU was then completed in the flank position. All procedures were completed successfully. No significant blood loss or complications were observed. The mean operative time was 250 min (range: 200-370) for a total procedure and 59 min (range: 42-80) for the T-LESS stage. The postoperative hospital stay was 5.2 days (range: 4-9). Pathologic examination revealed no positive margin in any of the cases. The LNU/T-LESS approach is an efficient and safe procedure. A well-visualized dissection of the distal ureter, closing the defect of the bladder, the use of standard laparoscopic instruments and a good cosmesis are advantages of the method.

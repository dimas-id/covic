Pulmonary fibrosis can be idiopathic or secondary to inflammatory states or injuries (Table 46.1). The tempo ranges from insidious to rapid, and the location of the fibrous tissue can be centered around or in the airways (bronchiolitis obliterans) or in the alveolar compartment (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF]). In this chapter, we focus on IPF, the paradigmatic fibrosing lung disorder.

Respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of pediatric disease. Emerging respiratory viruses can cause outbreaks with significant morbidity and mortality or circulate routinely. The rapid identification of pathogens, epidemiologic tracing, description of symptoms, and development of preventative and therapeutic measures are crucial to limiting the spread of these viruses. Some emerging viruses, such as rhinovirus C and influenza C, circulate yearly but were previously undetected due to limited diagnostic methods. Although some pathogens have a geographic focus, globalization dictates that providers be aware of all emerging diseases in order to recognize outbreaks and diagnose and treat patients.

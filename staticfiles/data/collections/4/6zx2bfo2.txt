PURPOSE In this systematic review, we report the safety and efficacy of embolization for treating hemarthrosis in patients with bleeding diatheses with or without a history of prior arthroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A structured search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases of patients undergoing embolization for hemarthrosis. Demographic data, clinical history, angiographic findings, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and tabulated. RESULTS The search identified 97 unique titles of which 15 were deemed relevant comprising 78 patients with coagulopathies undergoing 93 embolization procedures. Mean follow-up time was 29 months (range 3-116.5). In the 29 patients who underwent arthroplasty prior to embolization for hemarthrosis, there were 11 bleeding recurrences (37.9%). Of these patients who experienced recurrences, 10 underwent repeat embolization as coagulation factor replacement was not sufficient to address the re-bleeding. In the 49 patients with bleeding diatheses who underwent embolization for hemarthrosis with no history of prior arthroplasty, there were 11 recurrences (22.4%) and 4 of these patients underwent repeat embolization with favorable results. There were four major procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION Transarterial embolization is safe and effective in addressing recurrent hemarthrosis in patients with bleeding diatheses with or without a history of arthroplasty of the affected joint.

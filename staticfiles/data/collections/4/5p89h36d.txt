Abstract Sera from 486 bovine fetuses, approximately 60 to 270 days of gestation, were collected at slaughter and tested for the presence of immunoglobulins (Ig). One hundred ten (27%) of the sera were positive for IgG and/or IgM. The earliest age at which fetuses tested positive for IgM and IgG was estimated to be 100 and 120 days, respectively. Ig concentration increased with increased age of the fetus. Sera that were positive for Ig were tested for the presence of specific antibodies to five different infectious agents. Bovine parvovirus antibodies were found in 99 of 110 sera (90%) by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. However, only 35 (31.8%) of these sera were positive by serum neutralization (SN) test. Antibodies to parainfluenza-3 virus were detected in 30 sera (27%) by HI test and in 20 sera (18%) by SN test. Five (4%) sera contained SN antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus. Only one (0.9%) serum sample contained SN antibodies to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus. None of the sera had antibodies against five Leptospira spp. Results of this study suggest that bovine parvovirus may be a potential cause of reproductive problems in cattle.

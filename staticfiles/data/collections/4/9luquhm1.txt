Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by loss of liver function without pre-existing chronic liver disease. Drug toxicity and viral hepatitis have been identified as the main causes of ALF in Germany. The regeneration capability of the liver and overall prognosis are determined by the underlying etiology. Advances in intensive care medicine, supportive therapy, and transplantation surgery have improved the overall outcome of ALF over the last two decades. The clinical syndrome of ALF is mainly due to a release of inflammatory cytokines from necrotic hepatocytes, which lead to disastrous consequences in the immune system and hemodynamics. The main goals of supportive intensive care therapy in ALF are early identification and treatment of infections and the prevention and therapy of cerebral hypertension.

Sepsis is an overwhelming reaction to infection that comes with high morbidity and mortality, that requires urgent interventions in order to improve outcomes. Surviving Sepsis is an international campaign that aims to improve sepsis outcomes. The 2016 guideline modifies the previous definition of sepsis and proposes some specific diagnostic and therapeutic measures, such as the protocolized use of fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. We aim to summarize the main recommendations of the 2016 guideline that are relevant to the internist and evidence-base update them to the year 2020. In the current context, this review doesn't address patients affected by SARS-COV2 induced disease.

Abstract Private health insurance (PHI) is considered an important supplement to the basic social health insurance schemes in the Chinese healthcare system. However, whether the strategy of engaging PHI as supplementary coverage is effective cannot be determined without knowing the impact of supplementary PHI on healthcare access and utilization, the evidence on which is currently absent in China. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of supplementary PHI on hospitalization and physical examination to provide such evidence in the Chinese setting. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2015 wave of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Using probit models and bivariate probit models with instrumental variables (IVs), we evaluated the effects of supplementary PHI on the utilization of hospitalization and physical examination. Our analyses provided evidence that supplementary PHI increased the probability of physical examination but decreased that of hospitalization. Our findings suggest that supplementary PHI in China may effectively promote the use of high-value preventive care, thereby reducing subsequent utilization of expensive medical services. The present study provided preliminary evidence that the China healthcare system can benefit from engaging PHI as supplements to SHI.

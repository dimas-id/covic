Abstract Thoracic surgical oncology is a time sensitive, high resource, complex surgical speciality to which Coronavirus has posed a unique challenge. In response to the evolving situation in mainland Europe, our department rapidly established a Covid-free site to maintain elective cancer surgery. This necessitated a strict admission pathway and perioperative patient management. It resulted in the maintenance of a high-volume, high-quality thoracic surgical oncology program with no Covid-19 positive cases to date. Maintaining satisfactory training levels amongst surgical and anaesthetic trainees has also been achieved. We suggest that this model could be adapted to local resource capabilities.

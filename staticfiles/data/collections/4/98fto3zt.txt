The Coronavirus Disease (COVID ‐19) has created a variety of challenges for healthcare professionals, including ambulatory care clinical pharmacists. High‐quality remote and minimal‐contact care has become a necessity. Ambulatory care clinical pharmacists around the nation have adjusted their practice. In many cases, this included implementation of telehealth programs for comprehensive medication management. The redesign of ambulatory care Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPE) also required quick adaptation. In this paper, we describe the clinical practice and experiential education challenges encountered by an ambulatory care clinical pharmacist workgroup in a COVID ‐19 “hotspot,” with an emphasis on solutions and guidance. We discuss how to adapt ambulatory care clinical pharmacy practices including methods of minimal‐contact care, reimbursement opportunities, tracking outcomes, and restructuring ambulatory care APPE. As ambulatory care clinical pharmacists continue to expand the services they provide in response to COVID ‐19, we also describe opportunities to promote pharmacists as providers during times of pandemic and into the future.

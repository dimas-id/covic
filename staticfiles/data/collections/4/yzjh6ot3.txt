Models of host-microbe dynamics typically assume a single-host population infected by a single pathogen. In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably, within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus. Overall, we demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species aggregations.

Abstract In social life, some highlighted issues are regarded as unstructured or wicked problems, the solving of which is actually a problem-structuring and problem-solving process including the detection and discovery of some problem structures and relevant solutions, which are finally synthesized into an integrative solution toward the whole issue. In this study, a group argumentation test about a social highlighted event is introduced based on our designed group argumentation environment (GAE). With versatile analyses of the test results, it is addressed how GAE support people to become aware of or to acquire some threads or structures, which lead to in-depth research or quantitative modeling during unstructured problem-solving process.

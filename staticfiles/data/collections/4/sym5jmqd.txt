A survey of young children hospitalized with viral gastroenteritis, and of the members of some of their families, was carried out. Results showed rotavirus to be the principal agent associated with the condition though other types were also detected. In addition, rotavirus was found in the stools of some of the members of each of the families investigated, and it is suggested that means of spread is the faecal-oral route within family groups.

Abstract The use of plants for production of recombinant proteins has evolved over the past 25years. The first plant-based vaccines were expressed in stably transgenic plants, with the idea to conveniently deliver “edible vaccines” by ingestion of the antigen-containing plant material. These systems provided a proof of concept that oral delivery of vaccines in crude plant material could stimulate antigen-specific serum and mucosal antibodies. Transgenic grains like rice in particular provide a stable and robust vehicle for antigen delivery. However, some issues exist with stably transgenic plants, including relatively low expression levels and regulatory issues. Thus, many recent studies use transient expression with plant viral vectors to achieve rapid high expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, followed by purification of antigen and intranasal delivery for effective stimulation of mucosal immune responses.

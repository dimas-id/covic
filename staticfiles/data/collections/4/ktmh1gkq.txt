Laparoscopic colorectal surgery has rapidly developed since the 1980s. Relative to open surgery, it offers the benefits of less invasiveness and earlier recovery. However, when a mini-laparotomy wound is needed to retrieve the specimen, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery may be compromised as a result of pain- and wound-related complications. The introduction of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) makes "scarless" surgery a possibility; pain- and wound-related complications are totally abolished. However, a number of technical issues need to be overcome before this technique can be used widely. The development of natural orifice specimen extraction surgery abandons the need for a specimen-retrieval incision and helps overcome the technical hurdles of NOTES. As a bridge between true "scarless" surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery, hybrid procedures combining laparoscopic resection and natural orifice specimen extraction surgery currently play an important role in minimally invasive colorectal surgery.

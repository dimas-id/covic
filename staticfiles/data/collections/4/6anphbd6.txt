Abstract Drawing upon insights from research in the social sciences about the role of “issue framing” in policy debates, the paper presents an argument for employing “Responsible Science” as the fundamental frame for strategies to engage scientists and scientific organizations in issues related to the potential risks posed by “dual use” research in the life sciences. It argues that this focus on responsibilities rather than requirements will be more effective, particularly in initial engagement efforts. The work of several international scientific organizations to employ this framing in their education and outreach activities is presented to illustrate the advantages of such an approach. The paper also includes a case study of a controversy over dual use research with highly pathogenic avian influenza to illustrate the power of framing in policy debates.

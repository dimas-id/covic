Acute rhinosinusitis is a commonly seen disease that is frequently diagnosed based on clinical symptomatology without any objective evidence. The most common form of treatment is antibiotics, even though many cases may not have a bacterial etiology. The most common bacterial organisms in childhood sinusitis belong to the group that cause many childhood upper respiratory and lower respiratory infections and include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Besides antibiotics, other treatments are aimed at assisting with drainage, and this can be accomplished by reducing the inflammation and edema that prevents venting of the sinus structures. These medications can include antihistamines, decongestants, intranasal steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and, in some countries, mucolytics. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) techniques including Chinese herbal medications are often used, but there is little scientific evidence to support their use. The use of immunotherapy has not been found to be effective in the management of acute rhinosinusitis in children or adults.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affects anticoagulation not only in those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also in most patients who require daily anticoagulant therapy and are facing substantial limitations in medical care these days. Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has frequently been reported in patients with COVID-19, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and hematological alterations. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly recommended for patients who require chronic anticoagulation to continue therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. To avoid regular and frequent blood tests and unnecessary exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during contacts with medical personnel, direct oral anticoagulants should be strongly preferred whenever possible. Current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine pharmacological antithrombotic prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with COVID-19 who are suspected of VTE or in whom the diagnosis is confirmed, parenteral therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in the absence of contraindications. If heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected, nonheparin anticoagulants should be used such as bivalirudin or fondaparinux. In case of confirmed acute pulmonary embolism, treatment should be guided by risk stratification as defined in the current guidelines.

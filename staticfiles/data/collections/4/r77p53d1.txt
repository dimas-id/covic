At the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan and has spread throughout the world, bringing great challengees to the public health, prevention, and control work in our country and globally. Although the national medical staff and Public Health Epidemic Prevention personnel are fighting the epidemic, the large numbers of patients and the long-term isolation measures greatly impacted people's lifestyles. The epidemic's development has currently been eased, but the blockades and quarantines in many cities have not been completely lifted. While controlling the coronavirus, lifestyle changes caused by long-term isolation, as well as fear of the disease and economic recession have brought people various negative emotions. These mental health issues may cause or aggravate the occurrence and development of dry eye. Therefore, the authors explore the impact of mental health on dry eye during the COVID-19 epidemic, alongside possible mechanisms, and put forward relevant suggestions for managing eye-related diseases during and after the epidemic.

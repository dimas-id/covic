The emergence of new microbial pathogens, including drug-resistant strains, complicates treatment, thereby threatening global health. We demonstrated a photoimmuno-antimicrobial strategy (PIAS) that eliminated antibody-targets using a photo-activated anti-pathogen antibody generating mechanical stress that damaged the targetâ€™s binding sites. PIAS is effective against many pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and viral particles irrespective of their species or drug-resistance status. Animal experiments demonstrated that PIAS saved mice from fatal infections; microbiome and histochemical analyses indicated no apparent effect on normal host microflora and tissues in PIAS-treated mice. Resistance to PIAS was not observed during the eight years of this study. As a new type of anti-infection therapy, PIAS may contribute to advances in anti-infection strategies.

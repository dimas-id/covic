Abstract The live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine based on the Hu191 strain has played a significant role in controlling measles in China. However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.

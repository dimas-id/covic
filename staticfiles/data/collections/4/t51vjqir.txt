Abstract A markedly increased demand for vascular ultrasound laboratory and other imaging studies in COVID-19 positive patients has occurred, due to most with markedly elevated D-dimer, and a presumed prothrombotic state in many of the very ill patients. This article summarizes a broad institutional consensus focusing on evaluation and recommended empirical therapy for COVID-19 positive patients. We recommend following the algorithms with the idea that as more data becomes available that this may well change.

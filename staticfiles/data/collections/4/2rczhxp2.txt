A new coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 virus has brought the world to a state of crisis, causing a major pandemic, claiming more than 433,000 lives and instigating major financial damage to the global economy. Despite current efforts, developing safe and effective treatments remains a major challenge. Moreover, new strains of the virus are likely to emerge in the future. To prevent future pandemics, several drugs with various mechanisms of action are required. Drug discovery efforts against the virus fall into two main categories: (a) monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the virus and blocking it from entry; (b) small molecule inhibitors targeting key proteins of the virus, interfering with replication and translation of the virus. In this study, we are presenting a computational investigation of a potential drug candidate that targets SARS-CoV-2 protease, a viral protein critical for replication and translation of the virus.

The purpose of this rapid review is to provide an update on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments, our patients, and our new way of working. The gastrointestinal tract and the liver are affected by SARS-CoV-2, especially in patients with immunosuppressive therapies. Patients with liver transplantation should be followed closely. Digestive endoscopy is a high-risk procedure for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. While the pandemic lasts, we must adapt its indications and promote protective measures for patients and healthcare professionals alike. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our priorities and the way we work, although we do not know what the repercussions will be after normality is reinstated.

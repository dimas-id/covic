3-Chlorobenzofuran-2-carbaldehyde was condensed with substituted acetophenone by using the Claisen-Schmidt condensation to obtain 3-(3-chlorobenzofuran-2-yl)-1-(substituted phenyl)-2-propen-1-one (2a-m) which upon further treatment with hydrazine hydrate gave 2-[3-(substituted phenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-5- pyrazolyl)benzofuran-3-yl chloride derivatives (3a-m). All the newly synthesized derivatives were evaluated in vitro for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity in Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney cell, human embryonic lung (HEL) cell, HeLa cell and Vero cell cultures against different viruses. Several compounds, i.e. 2f, 2g, 2i, 2m, 3b, 3d, 3g, 3h and 3m proved quite cytotoxic to the host cells (minimum cytotoxic concentration: 1-10 microg/mL). No specific antiviral activity [50% antivirally effective concentration (EC(50)) >or= 5-fold lower than the minimum cytototoxic concentration] was observed for any of the compounds.

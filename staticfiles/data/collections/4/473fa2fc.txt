After pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection of murine L929 cells, the cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins changes such that the total amount of MHC class I molecules remains relatively constant but the levels of the individual alleles Dk and Kk vary. This is an active process involving at least three PRV gene products that act in an allele-specific manner such that cell surface expression of MHC class I Dk is decreased and that of Kk is increased. Our results indicate that an early gene product mediates the overall reduction in Dk protein and a late gene product which is mutant in the attenuated PRV strain Bartha mediates the increase in Kk protein. We provide additional evidence for a third gene product involved in the regulation of the synthesis of both the Dk and Kk proteins. In addition, we show that the early decrease in the Dk protein is not due to a block in synthesis or processing of the complex through the secretory system.

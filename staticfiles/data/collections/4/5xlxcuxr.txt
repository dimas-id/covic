A web-based survey was performed among the members of the World Federation of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology to determine the differences in availability, pricing, and performance of endovascular devices with special focus on coils, intra-arterial stroke devices, detachable balloons, and liquid embolic materials. The results of this survey show that the quality of the majority of interventional neuroradiology devices is good and compatibility issues are limited. Individual action towards suppliers is recommended to discuss the availability and pricing of devices and embolization materials.

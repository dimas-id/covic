Question: What are the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 and do they provide insight into the pathophysiology or prognosis? Findings: In this international registry-based case series of 716 patients representing 31 countries, the most common dermatologic morphologies encountered in the 171 COVID-19 confirmed case included morbilliform, pernio-like, urticarial, macular erythema, vesicular, papulosquamous, and retiform purpura. Retiform purpura was seen exclusively in critically ill, hospitalized patients. Meaning: COVID-19 is associated with a spectrum of skin findings in affected patients. These cutaneous manifestations may vary depending on the severity of COVID-19.

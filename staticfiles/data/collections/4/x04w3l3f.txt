CD147 is a transmembrane protein that plays crucial roles in the development and function of the reproductive, visual, and nervous systems. CD147 also exerts positive and negative actions in T-cells by still obscure mechanisms. In this study, we have analyzed the expression, localization, and function of CD147 during T-cell receptor signaling responses. We show here that CD147 is an integral component of the T-cell immune synapse and that its overexpression leads to the inhibition of NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) activity induced by Vav1, a Rac1 exchange factor. This inhibitory activity is mediated by the CD147 intracellular tail and is totally independent of its extracellular or transmembrane regions. The molecular dissection of the influence of CD147 on the Vav1 pathway indicates that its inhibitory action takes place downstream of Vav1 and Rac1 but upstream of the serine/threonine kinases JNK and Pak1. The interference of CD147 with these pathways is highly specific because the overexpression of CD147 does not affect the activity of other GDP/GTP exchange factors or the stimulation of the ERK cascade. Finally, we show that the CD147 knockdown in Jurkat cells promotes higher levels of NF-AT stimulation and Pak1 phosphorylation upon T-cell receptor cross-linking. Instead, the lack of CD147 does not affect other signaling cascades that participate in the same cellular response. Taken together, these results indicate that CD147, via the selective inhibition of specific downstream elements of the Vav1/Rac1 route, contributes to the negative regulation of T-cell responses.

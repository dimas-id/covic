Summary The prevalence of hypertension is high in patients affected by COVID infection and it appears related to increased risk of mortality in many epidemiological studies. The ACE system is not uniformly expressed in all the human races, and current differences could hypothesize some geographical discrepancies of infection around the world. However, animal studies showed that ACE2 receptor is a potential pathway for host infection. Because two third of the hypertensive patients take ACE-i/ARB, several concerns have been raised about the detrimental role of current drugs. In this report we summarized the current evidences in favour or against the administration of ACE blockade in the COVID era.

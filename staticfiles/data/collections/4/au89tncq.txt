Nine juvenile ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) with a history of diarrhea were severely dehydrated and had distended abdomens and thin-walled small intestines that contained gas and fluid. Histologically, small intestines exhibited acute superficial atrophic enteritis. Transmission electron microscopy of the small intestine showed rotavirus-like particles within apical vacuoles. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative for group A rotavirus. A group C rotavirus-specific RT-PCR assay was developed using consensus primers designed from the alignment of VP6 gene sequences of porcine, bovine, and human strains. A 182-bp product of the VP6 gene was sequenced and showed significant similarity to group C rotavirus VP6 sequences. This strain was designated "Ferret Rota C-MSU." The entire coding sequence of VP6 was determined and compared with other rotaviruses. Ferret Rota C-MSU virus was found to be most closely related to Shintoku group C rotavirus. This is the first definitive identification of a group C rotavirus in ferrets, based upon RT-PCR, sequencing, and genetic analysis.

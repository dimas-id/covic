OBJECTIVE: To report clinical and laboratory characteristics, as well as treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted for neurologic diseases with and without COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit from February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive for COVID-19 while 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0, IQR 67.0-83.8 vs 70.1, IQR 52.9-78.6, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6 vs 0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1, p = 0.006). In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, p < 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, p < 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, p < 0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p = 0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p = 0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p = 0.009) on admission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients admitted with neurologic disease, including stroke, have a significantly higher in-hospital mortality, incident delirium and higher disability than patients without COVID-19.

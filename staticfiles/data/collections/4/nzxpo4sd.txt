Rabies virus (RABV) and other lyssaviruses can cause rabies and rabies-like diseases, which are a persistent public health threat to humans and other mammals. Lyssaviruses exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of geographical distribution and host specificity, indicative of a long-standing diversification to adapt to the environment. However, the evolutionary diversity of lyssaviruses, in terms of codon usage, is still unclear. We found that RABV has the lowest codon usage bias among lyssaviruses strains, evidenced by its high mean effective number of codons (ENC) (53.84 Â± 0.35). Moreover, natural selection is the driving force in shaping the codon usage pattern of these strains. In summary, our study sheds light on the codon usage patterns of lyssaviruses, which can aid in the development of control strategies and experimental research.

The global crisis provoked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the economic and social consequences associated to the essential policies applied to contain it, necessitates the expedited development of therapeutic solutions. It is a priority to produce data both rapidly and accurately in order to identify current therapies that can be repurposed to offer protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. As healthcare workers are both at high risk for infection and able to be readily diagnosed, they offer a potential wealth of data to be analyzed. A systematic data analysis of exposure and infection rates among healthcare workers could yield patterns identifying common protective factors, such as medications with prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2, that can be fast-tracked into available therapies. With results suggesting their activity against other coronaviruses and their widespread adoption, Antiretroviral cocktails could be a promising initial target for such large-scale data analysis approach.

Laparoscopic vessel sealing devices have revolutionized modern laparoscopy. These devices fall into 2 major categories: advanced bipolar and ultrasonic instruments. The range of tissue effects available with these technologies is more limited than with conventional monopolar electrosurgery; however, both advanced bipolar and ultrasonic devices efficiently seal vessels (≤7-mm and ≤5-mm diameter, respectively), and most also have built-in tissue transection capabilities. These technologies have been the subject of a range of comparative studies on their relative advantages and disadvantages, and, to date, neither advanced bipolar or ultrasonic devices has been proven to be superior.

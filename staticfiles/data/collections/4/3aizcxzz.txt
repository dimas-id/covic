The authors present a review of biomaterials, substances traditionally derived from human or animal tissue or, more recently, biodegradable synthetics modeled after naturally occurring resources. These constructs differ from purely synthetic materials in that they are degraded or incorporated into a host's tissue. These biomaterials include a diverse array of medical products, such as acellular dermal matrix, bone substitutes, and injectables. In this review, the authors examine various clinical applications, including burn reconstruction and wound healing, breast surgery, complex abdominal wall reconstruction, craniofacial repair, and cosmetic surgery. Biomaterials such as acellular dermal matrix have proven beneficial in difficult-to-treat applications; however, more prospective data are needed to determine their true efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

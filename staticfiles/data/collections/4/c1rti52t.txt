In this study H(3)PW(12)O(40)·9H(2)O and H(3)PMo(12)O(40)·6H(2)O (HPA) particles were changed into nano forms by heat-treatment in an autoclave as a simple, repaid, inexpensive and one step method. The particle size of these nanoparticles was around 25 nm. The as-synthesized nanostructures were characterized by dynamic light scattering, X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma analyzer. Thermal stability of nanoparticles was surveyed by thermal gravimeter analyse. Acidity of prepared nanoparticles was investigated by pyridine adsorption method. Results showed rising acidity by declining particle size of HPA.

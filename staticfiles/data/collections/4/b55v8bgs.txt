Introduction Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair is an effective and safe method for the treatment of inguinal hernia. There are very few studies on regional anesthesia methods in TEP surgery. Aim To compare TEP inguinal hernia repair performed when the patient was treated under spinal anesthesia (SA) with that performed under general anesthesia (GA). Material and methods All total of 80 patients were studied between December 2015 and March 2017. Hyperbaric bupivacaine and fentanyl were used for SA, to achieve a sensorial level of T3. Propofol, sevoflurane, rocuronium, fentanyl, and tracheal intubation were used for GA. Intraoperative events related to SA, surgical times, intra- and postoperative complications, and pain scores were recorded. Results The mean operative time in the SA TEP group was 70.2 ±6.7 min, which was significantly longer than the mean operative time in the GA TEP group of 67.2 ±6.2 min (p < 0.038). The mean pain scores in the SA TEP group were 0.23 ±0.42 at the first hour, 1.83 ±0.64 at 6 h and 1.28 ±0.45 at 24 h. These scores were significantly lower than the corresponding scores of 5.18 ±0.84 (p < 0.001), 2.50 ±0.55 (p < 0.001) and 1.58 ±0.55 in the GA TEP group. Generally, patients were more satisfied with SA than GA (p < 0.004). Conclusions Spinal anesthesia TEP is significantly less painful in the early postoperative period, leading to earlier ambulation than GA TEP. Additionally, SA TEP results in significantly less need for analgesics and better patient satisfaction results. SA TEP seems to be a better alternative than the existing GA TEP.

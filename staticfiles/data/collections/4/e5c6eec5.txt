Burn injuries are highly complex and affect almost every major organ system in the body. The treatment of burn patients requires the presence of a well-organized team of caregivers who understand the multifaceted consequences of burn injuries and who are adept at coordinating care. An understanding of the multitude of abnormalities that must be addressed helps to guide therapy in these patients. Careful anesthetic and perioperative management of these patients carries special importance in this fragile patient population as a part of their often lengthy recovery and rehabilitation.

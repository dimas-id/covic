Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been causing huge economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Commercial PRRSV vaccines including killed and modified live ones are available. However the protective efficacy of these vaccines is incomplete. Thus, it is in urgent need to develop safer and more effective PRRSV vaccines. In this study, we constructed a recombinant plasmid co-expressing porcine glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPX1) and the envelope glycoprotein (GP5) encoding-gene of PRRSV (pcDNA3.1-GPX1-LSynORF5), and investigated the immune response induced following inoculation of mice and piglets. Significantly enhanced GP5-specific antibody, PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibody, IFN-Î³ level, as well as lymphocyte proliferation response, were induced in mice and pigs immunized with the DNA construct encoding GPX1 and GP5 compared with those inoculated with a construct encoding PRRSV GP5 only (pcDNA3.1-SynORF5). The enhanced cellular immune response in pigs induced by pcDNA3.1-GPX1-LSynORF5 was comparable to that induced by the attenuated virus vaccine JXA1-R, although the humoral immune response induced by the plasmid was much lower than the response induced by JXA1-R. Following the challenge with highly pathogenic PRRSV, less-severe clinical signs and rectal temperatures were observed in pigs immunized with the GPX1-GP5 construct compared with the control group. However, the viraemia of groups immunized with plasmid was more severe than that inoculated with JXA1-R, and it is likely that this could be attributed to the poor humoral response induced by the GPX1-GP5 construct. These results demonstrated that inclusion of GPX1 in a PRRSV DNA vaccine leads to an adjuvant effect, enhancing the humoral and cellular responses following vaccination.

Serum samples from 317 patients with patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were tested for the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-associated coronavirus, with sensitivities of 94% and 78% for the first 5 days and 6â€“10 days after onset, respectively. The specificity was 99.9%. N protein can be used as an early diagnostic maker for SARS.

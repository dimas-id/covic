INTRODUCTION Percutaneous image-guided ablation is an emerging minimally invasive therapy for patients with metastatic bone disease for whom radiation therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. The purpose of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ablation in achieving pain palliation and local tumor control of osseous metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 76 musculoskeletal metastases in 45 patients treated with percutaneous ablation. 63% (48/76) were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 35% (27/76) with cryoablation, and 1.3% (1/76) with microwave ablation (MWA). In 70% (53/76) of cases, associated cementoplasty was performed. Primary outcomes measured were pre- and post-procedure pain scores 4 weeks after treatment and local tumor control at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Mean age of the cohort was 63.6 ± 9.5 years. Median tumor diameter was 3.60 cm (range 1.0-10.0 cm). Mean and median pain scores before treatment were 7.5 ± 2.3 and 8.0, respectively. Post-procedure, patients reported significantly decreased pain scores at 4 weeks (mean, 3.7 ± 3.5; median, 3.0; p < 0.00001). Radiographic local tumor control rates were 83% (35/42) at 3 months, 77% (23/30) at 6 months, and 68% (17/25) at 12 months after treatment. The overall complication rate was 2.6% (2/76). CONCLUSION Percutaneous tumor ablation is a well-tolerated, minimally invasive procedure associated with improving pain palliation and achieving local tumor control of osseous metastases from NSCLC.

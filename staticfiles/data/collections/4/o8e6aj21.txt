BACKGROUND: Guidelines for ultrasonic devices use are imperative because infectious aerosols arising from airway procedures were a key etiologic factor in prior coronavirus outbreaks. This manuscript aims to summarize the available recommendations and the most relevant concepts about the use of ultrasonic scalpel during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. METHODS: Literature review of manuscripts with patients, animal models, or in vitro studies where the ultrasonic scalpel was used and the plume produced was analyzed in a quantitative and/ or qualitative way. DISCUSSION: Activated devices with tissue produce a biphasic bioaerosol composed (size 68.3‐994 nm) of tissue particles, blood, intact and no viable cells, and carcinogenic or irritant hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, styrene, toluene, heptene, and methylpropene). CONCLUSION: It is imperative to use an active smoke evacuator, to avoid ultrasonic scalpel use in COVID‐19 positive patients and in upper airway surgery, as well as to follow the protection recommendations of the guidelines for management this type of patients.

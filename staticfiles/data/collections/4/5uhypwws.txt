Some violence related to CoViD-19 counteracting measures occurred in some Italian prison last month. Epidemic CoViD-19 reflects the higher risk of infections among inmates and personnel, due to closed proximity, prison overcrowding and structural conditions of Italian prisons. In the world, the higher risk infections among prisoners has been investigated in many studies, showing that, compared with the general public, people in prisons have a higher prevalence of infection such as HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and tuberculosis. This is recognized as a major issue for the health of people in prisons, as well as the general population, because the majority of people who have been incarcerated will subsequently return to their communities. In Italy there are no enough available data to know the sanitary impact of such epidemic, so that preventive measures are extremely urgent.

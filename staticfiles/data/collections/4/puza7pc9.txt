A prevalent PEDV strain, designated FJLY06, was isolated from Fujian, China. The four of structural genes sequences of PEDV obtained were analyzed to determine their phylogenetic relationships and homology respectively, revealing that FJLY06 was highly homologous to virulent PEDV strains. The four structural genes all differed genetically from the vaccine strain CV777. The sequence alignment results further showed that N, M and E genes of Chinese PEDV strains is highly conserved. Compared with the vaccine strain CV777, 8 mutations were detected in COE of FJLY06 S gene. The recombination analysis revealed FJLY06 is similar to other pandemic strains in China with a variant S gene, and maybe a reason for recent vaccination failures.

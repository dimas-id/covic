Astroctyes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes of the central nervous system support neurons and their functions and are the main line of defense against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Viral infections trigger broad glial activation and the concomitant release of proinflammatory molecules, stimulating both the innate and the adaptive immune systems. If sustained, in some instances these responses may be deleterious rather than protective of the nervous system. Immunomodulatory mechanisms that limit activation and proinflammatory responses may be more effective at maintaining a balance between the proper response to infection and the preservation or recovery of tissue homeostasis. HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system is used as an example to characterize the glial response to viral infection.

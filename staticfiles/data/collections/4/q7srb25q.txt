Hemodialysis patients are at increased risk of infections, which are common adverse events among this patient population. We review factors contributing to infections among hemodialysis patients and epidemiology of common infections and outbreaks, including bloodstream infections, vascular access infections, and infections caused by bloodborne pathogens. Recommendations for prevention are discussed with emphasis on essential infection control practices for hemodialysis settings.

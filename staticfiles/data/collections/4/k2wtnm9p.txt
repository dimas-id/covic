Abstract Background: Nepal is currently under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic with misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal. Methodology: We invited 600 participants from 12 ophthalmic centres across Nepal to complete a qualitative, anonymous online survey. Results: Of the 600 eye care professionals invited, 310 (51%) participated in the survey. The symptoms of COVID-19 were known to 94%, whilst only 49% were aware of disease transmission. 98% of participants recognised the World Health Organization (WHO) awareness message, yet 41% of participants felt that consumption of hot drinks helps to destroy the virus. 41% disagreed that PPE should be mandatory for eye care practitioners. Conclusion: There is still considerable scope to improve the knowledge of COVID-19 amongst ophthalmic professionals in Nepal. Opinion is also split on measures to prevent transmission, with misinformation potentially fuelling confusion.

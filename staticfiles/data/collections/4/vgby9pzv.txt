OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to report complications, as well as short- and long-term clinical outcomes of cats suffering from surgically reduced intussusception with and without enteroplication. METHODS Medical records of cats presented at our institution with intussusception between 2001 and 2016 were reviewed. The following data were retrieved: signalment; history; physical examination; diagnostic imaging, surgical and histological findings; and outcomes. Animals were grouped as with or without enteroplication. Duration of surgery, survival, complication and recurrence rates, duration of hospitalisation, and short- and long-term outcomes were compared. RESULTS Cats with intussusception presented with unspecific type and duration of clinical signs. Male or male castrated cats and Maine Coons were over-represented in both groups. Enteroplication was performed in 48% (10/21) of the cats. Cats in the enteroplication group were significantly younger than those in the non-enteroplication group ( P = 0.023). Duration of surgery, time of hospitalisation, complication rate and outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Two complications in the short term and one complication in the long term were possibly associated with enteroplication. A recurrence of intussusception was seen in 2/17 cats approximately 12 months after initial surgery, both previously treated with enteroplication. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although the number of cases was limited, our results suggest that enteroplication should be cautiously performed in cats with intussusception as it may be associated with major complications in the short and long term, and its efficacy remains unclear. Based on this study, the need for enteroplication in cats following a correction of intussusception could be questioned.

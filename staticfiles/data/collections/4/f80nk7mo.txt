INTRODUCTION RNA interference is a sequence-specific gene silencing phenomenon in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can trigger gene transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing. This phenomenon represents an emerging therapeutic approach for in vivo studies by efficient delivery of specific synthetic siRNAs against diseases. Therefore, simultaneous development of synthetic siRNAs along with novel delivery techniques is considered as novel and interesting therapeutic challenges. AREAS COVERED This review provides a basic explanation to siRNA signaling pathways and their therapeutic challenges. Here, we provide a comprehensive explanation to failed and successful trials and their in vivo challenges. EXPERT OPINION Specific, efficient and targeted delivery of siRNAs is the major concern for their in vivo administrations. Also, anatomical barriers, drug stability and availability, immunoreactivity and existence of various delivery routes, different genetic backgrounds are major clinical challenges. However, successful administration of siRNA-based drugs is expected during foreseeable features. But, their systemic applications will depend on strong targeted drug delivery strategies.

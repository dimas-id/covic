The recent outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a global crisis, necessitating the identification of genetic factors that modulate the risk of disorder or its severity. The current data about the role of genetic risk factors in determination of rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in each ethnic group and the severity of disorder is limited. Moreover, several confounding parameters such as the number of tests performed in each country, the structure of the population especially the age distribution, the presence of risk factors for respiratory disorders such as smoking and other environmental factors might be involved in the variability in disease course or prevalence of infection among different ethnic groups. However, assessment of the role of genetic variants in determination of the course of other respiratory infections might help in recognition of possible candidate for further analysis in patients affected with SARS-CoV-2. In the current review, we summarize the data showing the association between genomic variants and risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory infections or severity of these conditions with an especial focus on the SARS-CoV-2.

Since the birth of the first somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) animal in 1996, SCNT has been successfully applied to produce live animals in many species, but its successful application in animal production has been hampered by heavy fetal and postnatal losses and widespread public concern. So far, cattle remain the species with the largest number of cloned animals born. Success in animal cloning relies not only on the skill of the micromanipulator, but also on integrated knowledge and expertise in the pathophysiology and biotechnology of reproduction, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, embryology, neonatology and obstetrics, image diagnostics, internal medicine, and surgical procedures, among other complementary disciplines and areas of knowledge. This chapter addresses the care of SCNT individuals and their recipients. The health and care in cattle will be described first, as most information is available in this species. Recommendations regarding pigs and other species will follow.

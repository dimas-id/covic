Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was used to produce cDNA which was sequenced. Two non‐overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest, encoding a polypeptide of 382 amino acids (relative molecular mass (M(r)) 43 483), was shown to be the viral nucleoprotein gene. The second ORF, found 3’to the larger ORF, encodes a polypeptide of 78 amino acids (M(r) 9068) which has yet to be assigned to a viral product. The nucleoprotein gene was expressed in yeast cells under the control of two types of yeast promoters: the constitutive PGK promoter, and the inducible GAL1 promoter. Yeast cells containing recombinant plasmids, with the nucleoprotein gene in the correct orientation, produced a polypeptide of M, 47000, identical to the viral product, that reacted with a specific monoclonal antibody.

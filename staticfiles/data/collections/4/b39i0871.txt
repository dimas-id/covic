PURPOSE OF REVIEW Menstrual problems are known to be common amongst teenagers, but adequate recognition of the impact this may have on the adolescent and appropriate interventions that are focussed on the needs of the adolescents are limited. RECENT FINDINGS To date, the impact of menstrually related problems on the quality of life of adolescents has been poorly studied. Although some studies report on the impact of, in particular, dysmenorrhoea on school absenteeism, less is known about the impact on psychosocial functioning. For other menstrual problems, even less is known. It is increasingly recognized that understanding the impact on quality of life is an important measure to better understand the impact of the health problem and also to ensure the optimal delivery of patient-centred healthcare. This review will explore the current tools available for assessment of quality of life in adolescents and then focus on the specific menstrual problems (dysmenorrhoea, heavy menses, oligo/amenorrhoea) and what is known about their impact on the general well being of young women. SUMMARY Cultural differences in the presentation and impact of menstrual problems appear to be present with a greater impact on psychosocial functioning found with particularly oligo/amenorrhoea. There is clearly room for further study to explore and then optimize care.

While numerous endovascular access routes have been described for carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) treatment, transarterial embolization via the neuromeningeal trunk of the ascending pharyngeal artery is typically avoided due to the risk of cranial nerve palsy or non-target embolization via external-to-internal carotid anastamoses. We present the case of a dural CCF in which access to the venous side of the fistula was achieved via the neuromeningeal trunk and allowed for curative transarterial intravenous coil/liquid embolic embolization of the lesion. The utility of a transarterial intravenous approach in the face of venous sinus occlusion is highlighted. The neuromeningeal trunk should not be overlooked as a potential access route for transarterial intravenous CCF embolization in cases where traditional endovascular access is limited; this approach does not carry the same risks that are generally associated with pure transarterial embolization along this pathway.

Surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight is a mass spectrometric-based method that requires a minimal amount of sample for analysis and can be used for high-throughput screening. It has been used to discover serum or tissue protein signatures and biomarkers for infectious diseases in the fields of virology (hepatitis B and C viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome, HIV-1, human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and BK virus), parasitology (trypanosomiasis) and bacteriology (intra-amniotic inflammation, tuberculosis and bacterial endocarditis). The protein signatures, or biomarkers, can be used to diagnose infection, predict disease states and to inform on disease processes. Careful attention to experimental design, sample handling and storage, and the use of appropriate internal controls is crucial to success.

A 36-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital with acute onset of left-sided chest pain. Computed Tomography confirmed the presence of a giant bulla on the apex of the lower lobe of the left lung. A video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with bullectomy was performed using two linear endostaplers. Additionally pleurectomy was performed. No serious complications occurred in the postoperative course, as the patient showed good lung re-expansion and no prolonged air leakage.VATS bullectomy is a suitable and eminent technique to approach giant bullous emphysema and definitely fulfils a role in its treatment.

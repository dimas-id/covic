The current COVID-19 pandemic overloads healthcare systems, including radiology departments. Though several deep learning approaches were developed to assist in CT analysis, nobody considered study triage directly as a computer science problem. We describe two basic setups: Identification of COVID-19 to prioritize studies of potentially infected patients to isolate them as early as possible; Severity quantification to highlight studies of severe patients and direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage. Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing methods provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. To consolidate both triage approaches, we employ a multitask learning and propose a convolutional neural network to combine all available labels within a single model. We train our model on approximately 2000 publicly available CT studies and test it with a carefully designed set consisting of 33 COVID patients, 32 healthy patients, and 36 patients with other lung pathologies to emulate a typical patient flow in an out-patient hospital. The developed model achieved 0.951 ROC AUC for Identification of COVID-19 and 0.98 Spearman Correlation for Severity quantification. We release all the code and create a public leaderboard, where other community members can test their models on our dataset.

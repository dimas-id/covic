A simple procedure for the rapid preparation of virus isolates from cell culture for negative-contrast electron microscopy was devised. Using only conventional centrifugation steps (i.e. without ultracentrifugation), the procedure produced consistent, fine-quality preparations of a variety of virus types differing in size/shape and buoyant density.

This chapter discusses the emergence of canine parvovirus (CPV), the evidence concerning the previous emergence of mink enteritis virus (MEV) as the cause of a new disease in minks in the 1940s, and the mechanisms that determine the host ranges and other specific properties of the viruses of cats, minks, and dogs. The viruses are classified as the feline parvovirus subgroup of the genus Parvovirus, within the family Parvoviridae. Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), MEV, and CPV are classified as “host range variants.” In addition to the viruses of cats, minks, and dogs, similar viruses naturally infect many species within the families Felidae, Canidae, Procyonidae, Mustelidae, and possibly the Viverridae. The differences in virulence for minks observed after inoculation of MEV or FPV suggests that there are subtle differences between FPV and MEV that have yet to be defined. Genetic mapping studies indicate that only three or four sequence differences between the FPV and CPV-2 isolates within the VP-1 lVP-2 gene determine all of the specific properties of CPV that have been defined: the pH dependence of hemagglutination, the CPV-specific epitope, and the host range for canine cells and dogs.

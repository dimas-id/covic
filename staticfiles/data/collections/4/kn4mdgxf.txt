Hybrid logic is modal logic enriched with names for worlds. We formalize soundness and completeness proofs for a Seligman-style tableau system for hybrid logic in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. The formalization shows how to lift certain rule restrictions, thereby simplifying the original un-formalized proof. Moreover, the completeness proof we formalize is synthetic which suggests we can extend this work to prove a wider range of results about hybrid logic.

We present the case of a 64-year-old female with a periadrenal paraganglioma. The mass was diagnosed during abdominal ultrasonography performed to investigate right flank pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion 48mm in diameter with an irregular hyperintense central margin, thickened septa, centrally located cystic component, and contrast enhancing peripheral portions. These findings made us think it was an isolated adrenal hydatid cyst. The mass was excised via laparoscopy without complications. Histopathological examination was consistent with periadrenal paraganglioma. We believe that the paraganglioma can mimic the radiological appearance of an isolated adrenal hydatid cyst, which should be taken into consideration during diagnosis.

BACKGROUND Capsule endoscopy (CE) has allowed the characterization of small bowel lesions. However, small bowel lesions in ulcerative colitis (UC) have not been elucidated and no studies have compared between UC and Crohn's disease (CD). AIM The objective of this study was to investigate the small bowel lesions in UC, and to characterize UC lesions by comparison with CD. METHODS Subjects comprised 54 UC patients and 39 CD patients who underwent CE. We retrospectively investigated characteristics of small bowel lesions in UC. We also compared endoscopic findings and degree of inflammation between UC and CD. RESULTS The incidence of small bowel lesions in UC was 27.8%. The group with small bowel lesions exhibited higher endoscopic activity in the colon than without small bowel lesions (p = 0.002). Comparing small bowel lesions between UC and CD, significantly more ulcerative lesions, notched appearance, longitudinal tendency of lesions, and cobblestone appearance were seen in CD. The Lewis score was significantly higher in CD than UC in the second and third tertiles (205 ± 379 vs. 73 ± 223, p = 0.01; 358 ± 449 vs. 105 ± 333, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Small bowel lesions in UC were linked to colonic activity. UC and CD differ in terms of the morphology and distribution of small bowel lesions.

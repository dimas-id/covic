PURPOSE: Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus endemic to North America capable of causing fatal respiratory failure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicates up to 10% of pulmonary blastomycosis in hospitalized patients and carries a mortality of 50-90%. This report describes the clinical course of four consecutive patients with blastomycosis-related ARDS treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during 2009-2014. CLINICAL FEATURES: Four adults were referred from northwestern Ontario, Canada with progressive respiratory illnesses. All patients developed diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiography and required mechanical ventilation within 6-72 hr. Patients satisfied Berlin criteria for severe ARDS with trough P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratios of 44-61 on positive end-expiratory pressure of 12-24 cm H(2)O. Wet mount microscopy from respiratory samples showed broad-based yeast consistent with B.dermatitidis. Despite lung protective ventilation strategies with maximal F(i)O(2) (patients A-D), neuromuscular blockade (patients A-D), inhaled nitric oxide (patients A and D), and prone positioning (patient D), progressive hypoxemia resulted in initiation of venovenous ECMO by hours 24-90 of mechanical ventilation with subsequent de-escalation of ventilatory support. In all four cases, ECMO decannulation was performed (7-23 days), mechanical ventilation was withdrawn (18-52 days), and the patients survived to hospital discharge (31-87 days). CONCLUSION: This report describes the successful application of ECMO as rescue therapy in aid of four patients with refractory blastomycosis-associated ARDS. In addition to early appropriate antimicrobial therapy, transfer to an institution experienced with ECMO should be considered when caring for patients from endemic areas with rapidly progressive respiratory failure.

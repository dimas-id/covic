The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a truly global public health crisis with substantive human, social, and economic costs. The pandemic and the associated preventive 'lockdown' measures have also given rise to a parallel mental health crisis, with elevated levels of chronic stress observed in the general population. Stress levels are also likely to be higher among at-risk groups such as those who have become employed or are on furlough, those in essential services with higher risk of exposure, and those from underserved communities. Development of efficacious means to assist individuals in effectively managing their during the pandemic and beyond is an imperative. We outline how stress reappraisal interventions offer a potentially efficacious, cost effective strategy to manage pandemic-related stress and minimize deleterious health consequences. Specifically, we advocate two stress management strategies: stress reappraisal, which involves prompting individuals to appraise stress as challenging and to be approached rather than threatening and to be avoided, and stress mindsets, which involves highlighting the enhancing nature of stress. We outline how these strategies may be implemented during the pandemic as part of interventions aimed at promoting stress management and better mental health during the pandemic and as communities emerge from lockdown.

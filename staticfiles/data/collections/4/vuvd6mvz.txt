Kerala reported the first three cases of coronavirus in India in late January. Kerala, one of Indias most densely populated states, which makes its success in fighting the Covid-19 all the more commendable. Moreover, an estimated 17% of its 35 million population employed or lives elsewhere, more than 1 million tourists visit each year, and hundreds of students study abroad, including in China. All of this mobility makes the state more vulnerable to contagious outbreaks. What is the strategy behind the success story? This paper compares the situation of COVID-19 pandemic in major states and Kerala by the different phase of lockdown, and also highlights Keralas fight against the pandemic. We used publicly available data from https://www.covid19india.org/ and Covid-19 Daily Bulletin (Jan 31-May 31), Directorate of Health Services, Kerala (https://dashboard.kerala.gov.in/). We calculate the phase-wise period prevalence rate (PPR) and the case fatality rate (CFR) of the last phase. Compared to other major states, Kerala showed better response in preventing pandemic. The equation for the Keralas success has been simple, prioritized testing, widespread contact tracing, and promoting social distance. They also imposed uncompromising controls, that were supported by an excellent healthcare system, government accountability, transparency, public trust, civil rights and importantly the decentralized governance and strong grass-root level institutions. The proactive measures taken by Kerala such as early detection of cases and extensive social support measures can be a model for India and the world.

Most people infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV2) are mildly symptomatic while few progress to critical illness and succumb to the infection. The disease severity is seen to be associated with increasing age and underlying comorbid conditions. Obesity, responsible for various metabolic disorders, appears to be a risk factor in determining the severity of infection despite any age group. Though this association is clinically relevant, the mechanisms underlying are not fully elucidated. SARS CoV2 enters host cell via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor, expression of which is upregulated in visceral fat tissue in obese people, underscoring the fact that adipose tissue is a potential reservoir for virus. Adipose tissue is also a source of many proinflammatory mediators and adipokines. High baseline C-Reactive Protein, interleukin 6, hyperleptinemia with Leptin resistance and hypoadiponectinemia associated with obesity explains the preexisting inflammatory state in obese individuals which predisposes them to worse outcomes and fatality.

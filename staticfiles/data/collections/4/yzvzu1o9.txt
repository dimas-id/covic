BACKGROUND Recent studies report safety and effectiveness of robotic hepatectomy. In present study, we describe our initial experiences with robotic hepatectomy, focusing on left-side procedures. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of 13, 10, and 11 consecutive patients who underwent robotic, laparoscopic, and open left-side hepatectomy by the single surgeon. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss, application of Pringle maneuver, postoperative hospital stays, number of IV analgesic injections, or postoperative complications between the robotic and laparoscopic groups. The robotic group had a smaller number of patients applied a Pringle maneuver (8.3 vs 90.9%, P < 0.001), a shorter postoperative hospital stays (7.0 vs 9.0 days, P = 0.044), and a less use of IV analgesics (2.8 vs 8.2, P = 0.005) than the open group. CONCLUSIONS From our initial experiences, a robotic left-side hepatectomy seems to be a feasible and safe procedure when compared with the laparoscopic and open left-side hepatectomies.

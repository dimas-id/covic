BACKGROUND Laparoscopic colectomy has been shown to confer equivalent disease-free and overall survival compared to traditional open colectomy. Patients experience benefit in length of hospital stay as well as diminished narcotic use. Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SIL-C) may offer additional benefit compared to traditional laparoscopic colectomy without compromising oncologic principles. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed records of patients who underwent SIL-C and traditional laparoscopic colectomy (TLC) for potentially malignant and malignant disease performed by a single surgeon. SIL-C consisted of a single-port access device with traditional lateral-to-medial laparoscopic technique. RESULTS Between January and October 2009, 27 SIL-C procedures were performed. Forty-six TLC patients from the prior year were used as controls. Median age was 70 years and 54% were female, with no differences between the groups. The median body mass index (BMI) was 27 kg/m(2) (range = 18.3-39.9) and 26 kg/m(2) (16.6-71.4) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively. The median lymph node harvest was 15 (range = 3-32) and 17 (0-35) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively. The median operative time was 114 min (range = 59-268) and 135 min (45-314) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively. Five SIL-C required additional ports while six TLC required conversion to open technique. The median length of stay was 3 days (range = 2-17) and 5 days (range = 2-11) for SIL-C and TLC, respectively (p = 0.079). There were five significant postoperative complications in the SIL-C group and 16 in the TLC group, including four postoperative ileus and one leak. There were no postoperative deaths in the SIL-C group and two in the TLC group. CONCLUSIONS SIL-C can be used safely in selected colon cancer patients with no difference in blood loss, OR time, or lymph node retrieval. SIL-C patients may have a shorter LOS.

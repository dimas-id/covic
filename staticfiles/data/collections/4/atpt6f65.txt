The ability of three avian viruses to elicit antibody response in humans was surveyed for the purpose of identifying zoonotic diseases. Antibody levels in people associated with poultry were compared to those in people having limited poultry association. Antibody levels to three avian viruses: infectious bursal disease virus, a birnavirus; Newcastle disease virus, a paramyxovirus; and avian infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Differences between the two study groups were evident: people having a known association with poultry showed significantly higher levels of antibodies to Newcastle disease and avian infectious bronchitis virus. Antibodies detected may be due to virus exposure rather than zoonoses.

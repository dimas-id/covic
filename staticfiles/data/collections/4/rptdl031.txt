Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are a family of ion channels whose members are distributed among all kinds of animals, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The importance of these molecules is exemplified by the variety of physiological roles they play. Perhaps, the most extensively studied member of this family is the TRPV1 ion channel; nonetheless, the activity of TRPV4 has been associated to several physio and pathophysiological processes, and its dysfunction can lead to severe consequences. Several lines of evidence derived from animal models and even clinical trials in humans highlight TRPV4 as a therapeutic target and as a protein that will receive even more attention in the near future, as will be reviewed here.

We present recommendations on performance and safety measures of ultrasound examinations in obstetrics and gynecology during the SARS COV-2 pandemic. The statement was prepared based on the current knowledge on the coronavirus by the Ultrasound Section of the Polish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It has to be noted that the presented guidance is based on limited evidence and is primarily based on experiences published by authors from areas most affected by the virus thus far, such as China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Italy. We realize that the pandemic situation is very dynamic. New data is published every day. Despite the imposed limitations related to the necessity of social distancing, it is crucial to remember that providing optimal care in safe conditions should remain the primary goal of healthcare providers. We plan to update the current guidelines as the situation develops.

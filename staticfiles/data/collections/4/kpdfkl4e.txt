The latest SARS COV2 coronavirus contributes to a pandemic of millions of COVID-19. Because there is no defensive immunity in humans and a virus can overcome inborn immune reaction, it can propagate unhindered, mostly in tissues contaminated. No unique therapies for COVID-19 contaminated patients are available at this time. The insights learned from previous respiratory viral infection control have given guidance into COVID-19 therapy. Several complementary treatments have been tentatively introduced in hospital environments such as immune-modulators, antiviral, convalescent plasma transfusions and natural products. In COVID-19 patients, some of these therapies have provided substantial curative benefits. Moreover, numerous studies and clinical trials are being carried out in order to determine the efficacy of current pharmaceutical and natural products and establish possible therapeutic strategies for producing novel COVID-19 medicines. We summarized and defined the modes of mechanism, protection and efficacy on existing therapeutic strategies for diseases linked to COVID-19 infection.

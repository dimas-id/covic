Abstract To investigate the ocular manifestations of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to monitor the possible ocular complications arising from the treatment regimen with high-dose systemic corticosteroid drugs. Design Prospective, observational cohort case series. Methods Ninety eyes from 45 patients with the diagnosis of SARS during an epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong were analyzed. Relevant medical and ophthalmic histories were taken. Ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit-lamp, and indirect ophthalmoscopy examination, were performed at baseline and at 2-month and 3-month follow-up. Setting Faculty practice in university hospital. Results Only two patients had mild elevated intraocular pressure at baseline and at subsequent follow-up. There was no loss of visual acuity, cataract progression, or increased cupâ€“disk ratio. Fundus examinations were unremarkable in all patients. Conclusions Our study did not demonstrate any ocular manifestations in patients with SARS. The treatment regimen of high-dose corticosteroid also did not show any significant ocular complications. Routine ocular screening of patients with SARS for diagnosis or for complications might not be indicated.

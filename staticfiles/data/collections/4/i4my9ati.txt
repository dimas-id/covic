New esters (sulfate, nicotinates, and 4-methoxycinnamate) of 18α-glycyrrhizic acid (18α-GA) were synthesized; these were D/E-trans-isomers of natural 18β-GA (GA), which is the major triterpene glycoside in the roots of Spanish licorice and Urals licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Gl. uralensis Fisher). Changes in the stereochemistry of the GA aglycone led to significant decreases in its anti-HIV-1 activity.

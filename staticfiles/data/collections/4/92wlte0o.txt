The real issue with the COVID-19 pandemic is that a rapidly increasing number of patients with life-threatening complications are admitted in hospitals and are not well-administered. Although a limited number of patients use the intensive care unit (ICU), they consume medical resources, safety equipment, and enormous equipment with little possibility of rapid recovery and ICU discharge. This work reviews effective methods of using filtration devices in treatment to reduce the level of various inflammatory mediators and discharge patients from the ICU faster. Extracorporeal technologies have been reviewed as a medical approach to absorb cytokines. Although these devices do not kill or remove the virus, they are a promising solution for treating patients and their faster removal from the ICU, thus relieving the bottleneck.

We read with great interest the recent editorial by Huang et al [1] regarding the unfortunately timely topic of considerations attendant to running a nuclear medicine department in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, which complements similar work on diagnostic imaging [2] and hospital-wide preparedness [3] As the pandemic has unfolded in a somewhat sequential manner [4], lessons learned in one geographic domain are of great value to physicians who practice in locations that are earlier on the learning curve One area of concern which we did not see covered in the comprehensive treatment relates to performance of ventilation scans, a standard component of ventilation/perfusion studies performed to exclude pulmonary embolus [5] The population of patients who are short-of-breath and considered for pulmonary embolus certainly overlap with individuals who may be suffering effects of COVID-19 infection Beyond standard methods of decontamination, which are relevant to all patients with suspicion of infection [2,6], is there a specific concern that patients performing ventilation studies will expose others to airborne virus by exhalation into the aerosolization system? Do we need to take any additional precautions to minimize airborne distribution of virus, such as requiring technologists to don respiratory mask to protect against airborne virus? Are there any changes in protocol that we can implement to mitigate risk?

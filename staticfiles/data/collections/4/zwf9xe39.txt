Severe acute respiratory syndrome is an infectious disease caused by a new type of coronavirus. It belongs to the seasonal febrile diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. The prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can be under the guidance of the doctrines for treating febrile diseases of traditional Chinese medicine, treatment based on syndrome differentiation, such as syndrome differentiation of triple energizer, syndrome differentiation according to defensive phase, qi phase, nutrient phase and blood phase. During April and May of 2003, 8 cases of SARS were diagnosed in Shanghai, and 6 patients accepted complementary therapy of traditional Chinese medicine, without death case. The only one patient who didn't take glucocorticoid therapy was complementarily treated with traditional Chinese herbs through the whole treating procedure. Upon the successful treatment of the eight cases of SARS in Shanghai, it is demonstrated that the triple-energizer syndrome differentiation and defensive-qi-nutrient-blood syndrome differentiation in traditional Chinese medicine are of high value in treating SARS patients.

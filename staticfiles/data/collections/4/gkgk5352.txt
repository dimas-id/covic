Several studies have been published describing the clinical and radiographic findings on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. Therefore, there is currently a lack of pathologic data about its effects in intubated patients. Pneumothorax may occur rarely and results from a combination of fibrotic parenchyma with prolonged high-pressure ventilation. Chest drain represent the first line treatment. However, in case of persistent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy and bleb resection may be a feasible option to reduce air leak and improve ventilation. We report the cases of two COVID-19 patients successfully treated with thoracoscopy, bleb resection, and pleurectomy for persistent pneumothorax.

The prevalence of cancer in patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, is uncertain. In a pooled meta-analysis including 11 retrospective studies, the prevalence of cancer was 2% (Desai et al, 2020). Patients with cancer and Covid-19 have been described to have a higher risk of suffering severe events (intensive care unit admission and invasive ventilation or dying) in a retrospective study including 18 patients with cancer (Liang et al, 2020). One study reported 13 Covid-19 cases in a cohort of 128 hospitalized patients with haematological cancers, with no significant differences in baseline co-variates between patients developing or not developing Covid-19 (He et al, 2020).

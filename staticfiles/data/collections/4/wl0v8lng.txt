Public health disasters reflect the uncharted conceptual, ethical, and pragmatic intersections between public health ethics and the emerging discourse on disaster bioethics. This novel concept reflects public health issues with calamitous social consequences such as infectious disease outbreaks, the attendant public health impacts of natural or man-made disasters, and currently latent or low prevalence public health issues with the potential to rapidly acquire pandemic capacities. The attendant moral dilemmas that PHDs generate have local and global dimensions. For this reason, they demand a multifaceted ethically grounded and pragmatically oriented approach. This chapter presents the conceptual foreground to the ethical and pragmatic dimensions of these issues.

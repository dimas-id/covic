The integrated clinical, laboratory and ultrasound approach is essential for the diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of the patient's therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia. The ideal imaging strategy in this setting is not yet well defined. Bedside pulmonary ultrasound presents an undeniable series of advantages in patients at high risk of infection, and can provide incremental data in the respiratory intensive care for the serial control of the individual patient, as well as for home delivery of stabilized patients. Chest X-ray is characterized by low sensitivity in identifying earlier lung changes. Pulmonary computed tomography shows high sensitivity but should not be routinely performed in all patients, because in the first 48 h it can be absolutely negative, and in the late phase imaging findings may not change the therapeutic approach. Echocardiography should be limited to patients with hemodynamic instability.

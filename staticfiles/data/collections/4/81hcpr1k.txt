BACKGROUND: Out-of-home child care (CC) is a risk factor for viral acute respiratory infection (ARI) in young children. Little is known, however, about differences in frequencies of viral infection between CC children and those cared for exclusively at home. METHODS: Using surveillance data from the HIVE household cohort in southeast Michigan from 2014–2018 (4 seasons), we analyzed 1022 illness cases from 354 children aged 0–6 years. Age groups were dichotomized as infants (aged <2 years) and toddlers/preschoolers (aged 2–6 years). Households were prospectively enrolled and nasal respiratory swabs were collected from children upon report of acute illness symptoms. We used real-time RT–PCR to test for 18 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: We detected at least one virus in 855 illness cases (83% of all illnesses reported). Age at first illness onset in all four seasons was significantly younger among CC children than homecare children (P < 0.001) across all 4 years (average difference = 1.25 years). CC children <2 years had slightly lower odds of viral detection during illness (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.49, 1.61]) but higher odds at ages 2–6y (1.07 [0.65, 1.76]); neither was statistically significant. Neither CC nor homecare children were significantly more or less at risk for any particular pathogen—expect for rhinovirus in the <2-year group, where odds of rhinovirus infection were 58% lower (OR = 0.42) in CC children compared with homecare counterparts (95% CI, 0.21–0.83). Conversely, CC attendees under 3 more frequently had influenza, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza, and coronavirus; however, none of these associations were significant. Odds of coinfection (> 1 virus detected) were higher among CC children, but not significant (OR = 1.4 [0.63, 2.96] and 1.2 [0.77, 1.88] in <2 year and 2–6 year age groups, respectively). Among all children <7 year, the mean number of pathogens detected was not different between CC and homecare individuals (1.20 vs. 1.23, P = 0.16). CONCLUSION: As expected, results indicated that CC attendees aged 0–6y experienced illness episodes earlier in life compared with homecare children. Our analysis also indicated that, compared with children cared for at home, CC children were less at risk for rhinovirus infection when young but could potentially be at higher risk for viruses of greater clinical concern.

The effects of a maternal vaccine against newborn calf diarrhea associated with group A bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine parvovirus and K99 Escherichia coli (E. coli) were examined on a beef cow-calf herd. After vaccination, serum or colostrum antibody titers to BRV, BCV and E. coli K99 in the vaccinated cows were significantly higher than those in unvaccinated control cows. Serum antibody titers to BRV, BCV and E. coli K99 in calves from the vaccinated cows were also significantly higher than those in calves from the control cows for 3-4 weeks after birth. These results suggested that the immunization of cows with the maternal vaccine enhanced the passive immunity levels in calves against BRV, BCV and K99 E. coli.

To determine the prevalence of antibodies to four major canine viruses, serum samples were obtained from 190 dogs presented to the Small Animal Hospital at the University of Liverpool. Antibodies to canine coronavirus (CCV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV) and rotavirus (RV) were assayed using serum neutralisation (CCV and CDV), haemagglutina‚Äêtion inhibition (CPV) and indirect fluorescent antibody (RV) techniques. Overall 54 per cent of dogs were seropositive to CCV, 84 per cent to CDV, 70 per cent to CPV and 86 per cent to RV, The antibody titres obtained were analysed with respect to a number of different parameters including: age, sex, breed, vaccination status, exercise regime, diet, Liverpool district in which the dog resided and the presence of diarrhoea, The prevalence and titres of antibodies to CCV, CDV and RV appeared to be influenced by age, CDV by vaccination status, and CCV by the presence of diarrhoea; no other influencing parameters were found.

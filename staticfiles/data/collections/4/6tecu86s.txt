Summary Clinical and pathological findings consistent with globoid cell leucodystrophy (GLD) were evaluated in two domestic shorthaired cats, aged 3 and 4 months. Both showed neurological signs mainly characterized by progressive pelvic limb ataxia, paraplegia with loss of deep pain perception in the pelvic limb, and intentional tremors of the thoracic limbs. Pathological changes affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems were characterised by diffuse, bilateral and symmetrical myelin loss, and marked astrogliosis. In the leucodystrophic areas there was perivascular accumulation of large PAS-positive, non-metachromatic macrophages (globoid cells), with intracytoplasmic accumulation of crystalloid tubular aggregates. Peripheral nerves showed demyelinating features with thin myelin sheaths, myelin splitting, and ballooning; the nerve fibres had bizarre shapes due to the presence of pale inclusions in the Schwann cells. GLD in cats shares clinical and pathological features with the disease described in other animals and human beings. The neurological signs differed from those of other feline inborn neurometabolic diseases and cerebellar hypoplasia.

BACKGROUND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery causes profound weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity (S(I)) in obese patients. Regular exercise can also improve S(I) in obese individuals; however, it is unknown whether exercise and RYGB surgery-induced weight loss would additively improve S(I) and other cardiometabolic factors. METHODS We conducted a single-blind, prospective, randomized trial with 128 men and women who recently underwent RYGB surgery (within 1-3 months). Participants were randomized to either a 6-month semi-supervised moderate exercise protocol (EX, n = 66) or a health education control (CON; n = 62) intervention. Main outcomes measured included S(I) and glucose effectiveness (S(G)), which were determined from an intravenous glucose tolerance test and minimal modeling. Secondary outcomes measured were cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) and body composition. Data were analyzed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) approach to assess the efficacy of the exercise intervention (>120 min of exercise/week). RESULTS 119 (93%) participants completed the interventions, 95% for CON and 91% for EX. There was a significant decrease in body weight and fat mass for both groups (P < 0.001 for time effect). S(I) improved in both groups following the intervention (ITT: CON vs. EX; +1.64 vs. +2.24 min⁻¹/μU/ml, P = 0.18 for Δ, P < 0.001 for time effect). A PP analysis revealed that exercise produced an additive S(I) improvement (PP: CON vs. EX; +1.57 vs. +2.69 min⁻¹/μU/ml, P = 0.019) above that of surgery. Exercise also improved S(G) (ITT: CON vs. EX; +0.0023 vs. +0.0063 min⁻¹, P = 0.009) compared with the CON group. Exercise improved cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2 peak) compared with the CON group. CONCLUSION Moderate exercise following RYGB surgery provides additional improvements in S(I), S(G), and cardiorespiratory fitness compared with a sedentary lifestyle during similar weight loss.

This chapter surveys how the biosecurity threat environment has changed since 9/11 and examines in detail a range of technological, psycho-social and policy drivers that will influence how our intelligence communities understand emerging bio-threats and risks. It argues that the emerging threat environment remains contentious though the intelligence enterprise must still come to grips with understanding the various drivers influencing bio-threats and risks.

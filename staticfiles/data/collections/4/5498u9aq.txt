OBJECTIVE To report perioperative outcomes and learning curve characteristics from a multiinstitutional experience with robotic-assisted surgical staging for endometrial cancer. METHODS A multiinstitutional robotic surgical consortium was created to evaluate the usefulness of robotics for gynecologic oncology surgery. An analysis of a multiinstitutional database of all patients who underwent robotic surgery for endometrial carcinoma between April 2003 and January 2009 was performed. Records were reviewed for demographic data and perioperative outcomes. Individual surgeon outcomes were analyzed as well in an attempt to evaluate characteristics of learning with incorporation of robotic technology. RESULTS Four hundred five patients were identified who underwent robotic surgery for endometrial cancer. Mean age was 62.2 years and mean body mass index was 32.4. Fifty-five percent of patients reported a prior abdominal surgery. Final pathologic analysis demonstrated that 89.6% of all patients had stage I and II disease. Mean operative time was 170.5 minutes. Mean estimated blood loss was 87.5 mL. Mean lymph node count was 15.5. Mean hospital stay was 1.8 days. Intraoperative complications occurred in 3.5% of the patients and conversion to laparotomy occurred in 6.7%. Postoperative complications were reported in 14.6% of the patients. For the group, fewer than 10 cases were required to achieve proficiency with the procedure. CONCLUSION Robotic technology may level the playing field between the novice and expert laparoscopist for endometrial cancer staging. Prospective trials should be undertaken to compare robotic and laparoscopic approaches to treat endometrial cancer. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III.

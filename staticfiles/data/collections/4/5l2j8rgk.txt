Stress and poor husbandry conditions are important factors that predispose ferrets to respiratory infections. The most common respiratory diseases of ferrets are canine distemper and influenza. Bacterial pneumonia is uncommon and usually develops secondary to viral pneumonia. Pulmonary mycoses are also rare in ferrets, although cases of cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis have been described.

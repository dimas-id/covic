Uveitis is common in cats, and is often a feature of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). We evaluated 3 tools for detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) in aqueous humor: 1) a 7b gene reverse-transcription real-time PCR (7b-RT-rtPCR) assay to detect FCoV RNA, 2) a spike gene mutation RT-rtPCR (S-RT-rtPCR) assay to detect 2 point mutations in the spike gene of FCoV in cats positive by 7b-RT-rtPCR, and 3) immunocytochemistry (ICC) for detection of FCoV antigen in aqueous humor macrophages. We studied 58 cats, including 31 cats with FIP and 27 control cats. FIP was excluded by postmortem examination and negative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Aqueous humor samples obtained postmortem were assessed using 7b-RT-rtPCR in all cats, and positive samples were evaluated with S-RT-rtPCR. ICC evaluation of aqueous humor samples from 36 of the 58 cats was done using an avidin-biotin complex method and monoclonal anti-FCoV IgG 2A. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were calculated including 95% CIs. 7b-RT-rtPCR had a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI: 87.2-100.0) and sensitivity of 35.5% (95% CI: 19.2-54.6). Specificity of S-RT-rtPCR could not be determined because there were no FCoV 7b-RT-rtPCR-positive samples in the control group. Sensitivity of S-RT-rtPCR was 12.9% (95% CI 3.6-29.8). Sensitivity and specificity of ICC were 62.5% (95% CI: 40.6-81.2) and 80.0% (95% CI: 44.4-97.5), respectively. The combination of 7b-RT-rtPCR and IHC could be useful in diagnosing FIP; S-RT-rtPCR did not add value; and ICC of aqueous humor samples cannot be recommended for the diagnosis of FIP.

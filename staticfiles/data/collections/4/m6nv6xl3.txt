BACKGROUND: COVID-19 challenges and needs required health systems to rapidly redesign the delivery of care. OBJECTIVE: To describe our approach in using health information technology to provide a continuum of services during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our health system deployed four COVID-19 telehealth programs, and four biomedical informatics innovations to screen and care for COVID-19 patients. Using programmatic and electronic health record data we describe the implementation and initial utilization. RESULTS: Through collaboration across multi-disciplinary teams and strategic planning, four telehealth program initiatives have been deployed in response to COVID-19: virtual urgent care screening, remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 positive patients, continuous virtual monitoring to reduce workforce risk and utilization of personal protective equipment, and the transition of outpatient care to telehealth. Biomedical Informatics was integral to our institutional response in supporting clinical care through new and reconfigured technologies. Through linking the telehealth systems and the electronic health record, we have the ability to monitor and track patients through a continuum of COVID-19 services. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 has facilitated the rapid expansion and utilization of telehealth and health informatics services. We anticipate that patients and providers will view enhanced telehealth services as an essential aspect of the healthcare system. Continuation of telehealth payment models at federal and private levels will be a key factor in whether this new uptake is sustained. CONCLUSION: There are substantial benefits in utilizing telehealth during the COVID-19, including the ability to rapidly scale the number of patients being screened and providing continuity of care.

Indications for ileocolonoscopy were defined in 2002 by the Groupe Francophone d’Hépatologie Gastroentérologie et Nutrition. These recommendations were updated with new data and technical innovations appearing over the last decade. Ileocolonoscopy is primarily indicated for digestive bleeding or anemia and for suspected inflammatory bowel disease. It is now indicated in inflammatory bowel disease for control of mucosal healing after medical treatment and relapse after surgical resection. Iterative ileocolonoscopy is primarily indicated for genetic polyposis and well defined for familial adenomatous polyposis. The contraindications were not modified.

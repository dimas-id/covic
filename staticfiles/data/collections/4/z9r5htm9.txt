Hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) is a multi-transmembrane protein, but little is known about how NS4B contributes to HCV replication and tumorigenesis. Its C-terminal domain (CTD) has been shown to associate with intracellular membrane, and we have previously shown that NS4B CTD contains a class I PDZ-binding motif (PBM). Here, we demonstrated that NS4B PBM interacts with the PDZ-containing tumor suppressor protein, Scribble, using immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and this interaction requires at least three contiguous PDZ domains of Scribble. In addition, NS4B PBM specifically induced Scribble degradation by activating the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway. Similar Scribble degradation was also observed in HCV-infected cells, suggesting NS4B could work in the context of HCV. Finally, NS4B PBM mutants showed reduced colony formation capacity compared with its wild-type counterpart, indicating that NS4B PBM plays important roles in NS4B-mediated cell transformation. Altogether, we provide a mechanism by which NS4B induces cell transformation through its PBM, which specifically interacts with the PDZ domains of Scribble and targets Scribble for degradation.

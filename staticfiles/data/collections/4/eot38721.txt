Abstract The global outbreak in 2002â€“2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) posed a serious threat to public health and had a significant impact on socioeconomic stability. Although the global outbreak of SARS has been contained, there are serious concerns over its re-emergence and bioterrorism potential, and up to date, no specific treatment exists for this disease. Here we review the progress of studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, in particular, studies on the molecular level.

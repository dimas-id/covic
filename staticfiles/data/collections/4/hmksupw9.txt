Although elective surgeries and in-person office visits were greatly reduced during the COVID-19 crisis, orthopaedic surgeons continue to play a critical role in caring for both orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic problems during this pandemic. Orthopaedic departments provide the ability to off-load emergency departments of orthopaedic issues, redeploy staff to areas of need across the hospital system, and provide direct care to COVID-19 patients. The following will discuss the experience of a large academic orthopaedic surgery department within the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to redeployment of human capital, unique resources such as the USNS Comfort, as well as our recommended strategy for handling future disaster situations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:: Prognostic Level V. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

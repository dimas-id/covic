BACKGROUND Synthetic materials have traditionally been used for tissue reconstruction in thoracic surgery. New biomaterials have been tested in other areas of surgery with good results. The aim of our study is to evaluate our initial experience using prostheses in extended thoracic surgery. METHODS A review was performed of all patients who underwent extended surgical procedures requiring soft tissue reconstruction with bioprosthetic materials after thoracic surgery from August 2009 to August 2011. A total of 44 consecutive patients were included. Operations involved radical pleurectomy and decortication for mesothelioma (n = 29), extended operations for thoracic malignancies (n = 8), surgery for trauma or perforated organs or complications (n = 6), and for benign infectious causes (n = 1). RESULTS A total of 76 patches were used in 44 patients (median of 2; range 1 to 3 per patient). Median hospital stay was 13 (range 5 to 149) days. Three patients died during the postoperative period (6.8%); pulmonary embolism 5 days after intrapericardial pneumonectomy with chest wall reconstruction, fatal pneumonia 26 days after radical pleurectomy and decortication for mesothelioma, and bronchopleural fistula 11 days after pneumonectomy with diaphragm and atrium excision for lung cancer after initial chemoradiotherapy. No other surgical exploration or removal of patches has been required for infection. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience of using bioprosthetic patches for soft tissue reconstruction in thoracic surgery has proven satisfactory with overall acceptable results. The infection rates are low even when a proportion of procedures were performed under contaminated environments. Biologic prosthesis should be part of the surgical options to reconstruct soft tissues in thoracic surgery.

A five‐year‐old female dog was presented with a four‐week history of inappetence, weight loss, and skin and gait abnormalities. Physical examination revealed weakness, depression, incoordination of the posterior limbs, emaciation, skin and hair coat alterations, peripheral lymphadenopathy, pale mucous membranes and fever. Laboratory analysis of samples revealed abnormalities which included anaemia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low serum glucose and albumin concentrations, and increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity. The diagnosis was confirmed microscopically, by demonstrating the presence of Hepatozoon canis gametocytes within neutrophils in Giemsa‐stained peripheral blood smears. Treatment consisting of toltrazuril and a trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole combination was effective in relieving the clinical signs and clearing the blood of H canis gametocytes. To the authors’knowledge, this is the first detailed clinical description of H canis infection in a dog in Turkey.

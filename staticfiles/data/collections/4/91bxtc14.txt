A group of 23 student volunteers were each inoculated intranasally with 400 IU of inactivated, freeze-dried A/England/42/72 vaccine. Only one volunteer showed a four-fold rise in serum HI antibody following immunization, and the mean increase in serum HI antibody (gmt) for all volunteers did not increase two-fold. Thirteen of the volunteers developed detectable levels of nasal wash neutralizing antibody after immunization; local antibody was most commonly found in volunteers who also produced a detectable but less than four-fold rise in serum antibody titre, and who produced nasal washings with relatively high concentrations of protein and secretory IgA. Four weeks after immunization, the vaccinees and a matched group of control subjects were inoculated with attenuated A/England/42/72 (MRC-7) virus. Evidence of infection was found in 14 of 23 (61 per cent) of control subjects and in seven of 23 (30 per cent) of immunized volunteers. This result showed a significant protection (P=0.04) against challenge virus infection for volunteers given intranasal vaccine.

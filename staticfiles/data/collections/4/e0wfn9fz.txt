Abstract The arterivirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is a multifunctional protein that binds viral RNA for encapsidation and has potential roles in host cell processes. This study characterised the N protein from a highly virulent North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The association with viral RNA was mapped to defined motifs on the N protein. The results indicated that disulphide bridge formation played a key role in RNA binding, offering an explanation why infectious virus cannot be rescued if cysteine residues are mutated, and that multiple sites may promote RNA binding.

BACKGROUND Vaginal cuff dehiscence with small bowel evisceration after hysterectomy is a rare event that may be occurring more frequently with the advent of robotic laparoscopic hysterectomies. CASES Two women underwent robotic total laparoscopic hysterectomy for menorrhagia and stage I endocervical adenocarcinoma, respectively. Each presented 7-8 weeks postoperatively with abdominal pain and vaginal pressure after intercourse. The small bowel protruded into the vagina through the dehisced vaginal cuff. Both cuffs were repaired vaginally with delayed absorbable suture. One repair required revision 7 weeks after the initial repair. CONCLUSION Robotic total laparoscopic hysterectomy may be associated with increased risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence and small bowel evisceration. This observation may be because of thermal spread and cuff tissue damage from electrosurgery used for colpotomy.

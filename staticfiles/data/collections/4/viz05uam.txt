Abstract Recent study proves that the combination of loop mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) with one-step strand displacement (OSD) is of great help to improve the sequence specificity during genetic detection. However, because OSD is incapable of signal amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio or the observable signal change may be usually not significant enough to satisfy practical usage. With the purpose to overcome this challenge, herein a more advanced and practical sensing principle is developed with the OSD replaced by an amplifiable nucleic acid circuit, hybridization chain reaction (HCR). The very contagious norovirus (NoV) was employed as the model target. Compared with LAMP-OSD, the LAMP-HCR can detect as few as 30 copies of NoV gene in 2% fecal samples with significantly enlarged signal change and signal-to-background ratio. Therefore, more reliable detection is achieved. Moreover, due to the high compatibility of HCR, the final LAMP-HCR products can be flexibly transduced into different types of readouts, including fluorescence, flow cytometer (FCM) and even a personal glucose meter (PGM). This further enlarges the operating environments for the detection from hospital labs, bedsides, to potential off-the-shelf devices in local pharmacies. Especially when using FCM or PGM, with the assistance of magnetic beads (MBs), the detection shows even higher tolerance capability to complicated biological matrices.

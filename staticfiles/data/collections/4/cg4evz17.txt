Phytochemical investigation of the roots of Calophyllum blancoi growing in Taiwan resulted in the isolation of three new pyranoxanthones, blancoxanthone (1), acetyl blancoxanthone (2) and 3-hydroxyblancoxanthone (3), in addition to two known pyranoxanthones, pyranojacaeubin (4) and caloxanthone (5). Structural characterization of the isolated compounds was determined by spectral analyses especially 2-D NMR. Biological study of the isolated xanthones revealed that blancoxanthone (1) exhibited significant anti-coronavirus activity.

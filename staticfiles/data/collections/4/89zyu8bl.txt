OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and lethal disease caused by a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Currently, there is no efficient treatment and prevention for this disease. We constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors that can express shRNAs, which inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV genes effectively in mammalian cells. METHODS: In this study, we designed several plasmids that express small hairpin RNA molecules (shRNA) specifically targeting to the genes encoding for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and envelope (E) protein, respectively. Effective shRNA molecules to the viral genes were screened and identified, and then constructed into adenovirus vectors. The effects of adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA on SARS-CoV gene expression were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase activity assays. RESULTS: The levels of viral mRNAs and viral proteins of the targets were significantly decreased or completely inhibited in cell lines after being infected with the recombinant adenoviruses that expressed specific shRNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful tool for shRNA delivery and for gene suppression, especially when the targeted cells are resistant to transfection by DNA or RNA. With availability of high titers of adenoviruses and uniform and rapid infection, this approach would have foreseeable wide applications both in experimental biology and molecular medicine.

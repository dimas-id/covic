Objective. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a new advanced technology to further minimize the invasiveness of laparoscopy through a single small incision hidden in the umbilicus. The objective is to describe short and long-term outcomes of SILS cholecystectomy. Methodology. Patients with gallbladder pathologies were unselectively enrolled and were prospectively studied between April 2009 and April 2010 and completed a post-operative follow-up for 12 months. Results. There were 22 women and 8 men. Mean age was 46 years. Twenty-one patients had biliary colic, seven had acute cholecystitis, one had gallbladder polyp, and another had resolving acute pancreatitis. Mean operative time was 104.3 ± 44 minutes. Mean BMI was 30.42 and the average pain score was 3.2 ± 1.1. One more port was inserted to help in finishing the procedure in one patient. There was no conversion to a standard laparoscopic or open technique. There was one post-operative bile collection from a missed cyctic duct of Luschka. Mean hospital stay was 1.2 days. Conclusion. Single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is feasible. Early conversion to a standard laparoscopic technique is advised to avoid serious complications. The procedure has an obvious cosmetic benefit. Additional prospective trials are necessary to define the benefits of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

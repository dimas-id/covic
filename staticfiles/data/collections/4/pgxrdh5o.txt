Mandibular arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare lesion, but it often can be presented with life-threatening bleedings. Endovascular treatment of mandibular AVMs has multiple approaches including transarterial embolization, transvenous embolization, direct puncture, and sclerotherapy. In this case study, we present a patient with mandibular AVM complicated by hemorrhage. The patient was treated with transarterial embolization, followed by transvenous sclerotherapy with balloon occlusion of venous outflow. But radical occlusion of AVM was achieved only by transvenous embolization of AVM with Onyx via double lumen balloon, which occluded the venous outflow.

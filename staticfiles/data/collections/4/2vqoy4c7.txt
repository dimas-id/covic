Research Question: What is the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertility patients? Design: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice, in the United States, between January 1(st) 2019 and April 1(st) 2020. Respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of ten commonly reported life stressors at three different time points. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients with 3,604 responses (response rate 34%) received. We included 2,202 non-pregnant, female respondents in the final analysis. One third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking anti-depressant medications. At all three time points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor amongst the respondents in early March but, currently, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66% respectively). 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Despite the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19, causing economic and societal uncertainty, the stress of infertility remains significant and is comparable a stressor to the pandemic itself.

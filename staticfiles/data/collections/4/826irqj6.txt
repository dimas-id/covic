Partial nephrectomy (PN) is currently the standard treatment for T1 renal tumors. Minimally invasive PN offers decreased blood loss, shorter length of stay, rapid convalescence, and improved cosmesis. Due to the challenges inherent in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, its dissemination has been stifled. Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) offers an intuitive platform to perform minimally invasive PN. It is one of the fastest growing robotic procedures among all surgical subspecialties. RAPN continues to improve upon the oncological and functional outcomes of renal tumor extirpative therapy. Herein, we describe the surgical technique, outcomes, and complications of RAPN.

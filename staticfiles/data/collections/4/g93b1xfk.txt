In recent years, adjuvant research has moved from empirical trial and error to a more rational approach engaging the multidisciplinary fields of immunology, biochemistry, pharmacy and physical chemistry. At the Modern Vaccines/Adjuvants Formulation meeting held in Cannes, France in October 2010, scientists from this broad field met to discuss recent progress in adjuvant research and development. The focus of the meeting was on formulation and as a result clinically and pharmaceutically relevant aspects of how to design and optimize vaccines and adjuvants were also addressed.

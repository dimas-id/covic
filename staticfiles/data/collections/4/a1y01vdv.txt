Abstract Background: In early December 2019, the first clusters of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were identified in Wuhan, China and attributed to a novel coronavirus, now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Kuwait reported its first cases of COVID-19 on February 24th 2020 and since then the number of cases has been increasing rapidly. Methods and Findings: This is a retrospective single-center study of consecutive 417 COVID-19 patients admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad hospital between 24/2/2020 and 24/5/2020. The mean age of cohort was 45.35 years (S.D. 17.16) and 62.8% of cases were males. Patients were divided into four groups; Asymptomatic group, symptomatic group with mild form of the disease, ICU survivors and ICU death. In total, 39.3% of patients were asymptomatic, 41% were symptomatic with mild symptoms, 5.3% were admitted to ICU and recovered and 14.4% died. Mean age of ICU patients was 53.61 years (S.D. 13.43). Comorbidities were more prevalent in ICU death group when compared to other groups (p<0.05) including Diabetes (40%), Hypertension (46.7%), Asthma (20.3%) and cardiovascular disease (21.7%). Blood biochemistry analysis showed that ICU death group had a characteristic abnormal pattern of certain markers upon admission in the ICU. Including significantly high WBC and neutrophil counts (P<0.05) and prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P<0.05). D-dimer, C-reactive protein and Procalcitonin (PCT) showed significantly high levels in ICU admissions and in ICU death group in particular (P<0.05). Kidney injury complications were reported in 65% of ICU death group (P<0.05) which also showed significantly elevated urea levels (P<0.05). We also reported rapid deteriorating kidney function (eGFR) in ICU death cases during ICU stay until the outcome was reached. Conclusions: In this single-center study of 417 COVID19 patients in Kuwait. The disease showed varying degree of severity ranging from asymptomatic status to death. Our comprehensive laboratory analysis revealed distinct abnormal patterns of markers that are associated with poor prognosis. Our dynamic profiling of eGFR in COVID-19 ICU patients highlight potential role of renal markers in forecasting disease outcome and perhaps identify patients at risk of poor outcome.

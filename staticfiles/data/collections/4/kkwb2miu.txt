[Image: see text] Bioactive compounds for drug discovery are increasingly extracted and purified from natural sources including marine organisms. Heparin is a therapeutic agent that has been used for several decades as an anticoagulant. However, heparin is known to cause many undesirable complications such as thrombocytopenia and risk of hemorrhage. Hence, there is a need to find alternatives to current widely used anticoagulant drugs. Here, we extract a sulfated polysaccharide from sea hare, that is, Bursatella leachii viscera, by enzymatic digestion. Several analytical approaches including elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-performance liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry analysis show that B. leachii polysaccharides have chemical structures similar to glycosaminoglycans. We explore the anticoagulant activity of the B. leachii extract using the activated partial thromboplastin time and the thrombin time. Our results demonstrate that the extracted sulfated polysaccharide has heparin-like anticoagulant activity, thus showing great promise as an alternative anticoagulant therapy.

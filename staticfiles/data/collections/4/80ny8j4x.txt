BACKGROUND The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of three-port laparoscopic right colectomy (3-LRC) for right-sided colon cancer compared with conventional five-port laparoscopic right colectomy (5-LRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred sixty-three patients diagnosed with right-sided colon adenocarcinoma underwent laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC) between April 2011 and December 2017. Seventy-four of these patients underwent 3-LRC procedure and 89 patients underwent 5-LRC. Clinical characteristics, perioperative short-term outcomes, and pathologic data were analyzed. RESULTS There were no differences in TNM stage, tumor location, estimated blood loss, complications, and open conversion rates. The operation time was shorter in the 3-LRC group than in 5-LRC group (140.9 ± 27.5 minutes versus 178.2 ± 38.2 minutes; P = .001). The number of harvested lymph nodes (28.5 ± 13.9 versus 22.6 ± 11.7; P = .004) was also higher in the 3-LRC group. The first passage of flatus and first oral diet were significantly faster in the 3-LRC group than in the 5-LRC group (2.8 ± 1.0 days versus 4.0 ± 1.2 days; P = .001, 3.6 ± 2.9 days versus 5.0 ± 1.5 days; P = .001). The number of patients who required analgesics is less in the 3-LRC group (32.4% versus 43.8%; P = .583). CONCLUSION 3-LRC for right-sided colon cancer is technically feasible and is associated with a short operation time. We believe that 3-LRC effectively reduces the costs associated with equipment and manpower and represents a standard procedure.

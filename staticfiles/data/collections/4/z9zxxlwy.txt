UNLABELLED The solitary fibrous tumour of the visceral pleura is a rare neoplasm that derives from mesenchymal cells adjacent to the mesothelial tissue of pleura. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in benign lesions and healing resulting in half of malignant. Local recurrence can occur in malignant cases, but it is very rare in solitary benign tumors. It may be a result of an incomplete or conservative surgery, lack of identification of a tumor during the operation or a growth of a synchronous neoplasm independent from that removed. Surgical resection is also burdened with some difficulty as the size of the tumor, the relationship with the adjacent structures and identification of the vascular peduncle. We report a case of 72 years-old male with a sessile left solitary fibrous tumour of the visceral pleura. The mass of 10 x 7 x 5 cm was attached, thanks to large planting base, to lateral basal segment of left lower lobe. The patient was treated by single port video assisted approach with a 4 cm skin incision. This case, in our knowledge, represents the first resection by single port VATS of a sessile SFTP with a large plating base and, more generally, the third SFTP resection treated by single portal access.

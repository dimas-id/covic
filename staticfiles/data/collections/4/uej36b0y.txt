PURPOSE The prospective, multicenter Revive Acute ischemic stroke Patients ImmeDiately (RAPID) trial was carried out to evaluate the real-world safety and efficacy of the Revive SE stent retriever. METHODS From January 2017 the study planned to enroll 100 patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with the Revive SE as a first pass. The study primary outcomes were rates of favorable reperfusion using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score [mTICI] 2b/3 and rates of favorable outcome with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2 at 3 months. The secondary outcomes were time interval from puncture to vascular reperfusion, number of passes by Revive SE stent-retriever, incidence of distal embolization and into new territories and rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) within 24 h post intervention. RESULTS A total of 100 treated patients (mean age: 65.6 ± 11.3 years) were enrolled. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale before the procedure was 16. Target vessel occlusions were as follows: middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 in 48, M2 in 6, anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in 3, internal carotid artery (ICA) in 22, basilar artery (BA) in 17, and vertebral artery (VA) in 4. Reperfusion rate with Revive SE without rescue devices was 69%. Reperfusion rate with Revive SE only was 83.3% in MCA M2, followed by 82.4% in BA. Thromboembolic complications and SICH developed in 10% and 2% of patients, respectively. Overall, a satisfactory reperfusion was achieved in 92% and a favorable outcome at 90 days in 48%. CONCLUSION Use of the Revive SE for thrombectomy appeared to be effective and safe but these findings need be confirmed in larger clinical trials (RAPID ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03007082).

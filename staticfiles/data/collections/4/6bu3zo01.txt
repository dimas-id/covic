The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to more than 100 countries. Children approved to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Preventing and controlling the epidemic while ensuring orderly flows of pediatric surgery clinical work has proven to be a big challenge for both patients and clinicians during the epidemic. Based on the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and the requirements for prevention and control of COVID-19, the authors proposed some concrete measures and practical strategies of managing emergency, limited-term, and elective pediatric surgeries during the epidemic period.

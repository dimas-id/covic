Febrile neutropenic patients are at increased risk of developing infections. During the initial stages of neutropenia, most of these infections are bacterial. The spectrum of bacterial infections depends to some extent on whether or not patients receive antimicrobial prophylaxis when neutropenic. Since most transplant recipients do, Gram-positive organisms predominate, due to the fact prophylaxis is directed primarily against Gram-negative organisms. Staphylococcus species (often methicillin-resistant), Streptococcus species (viridans group streptococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci), and Enterococcus species (including vancomycin-resistant strains) are isolated most often. Therefore, potent empiric Gram-positive coverage is recommended by many in this setting. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella species are the most common Gram-negative pathogens isolated. Non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter species) are emerging as important pathogens. Many of these organisms acquire multiple mechanisms of resistance that render them multidrug resistant. The administration of prompt, broad-spectrum, empiric, antimicrobial therapy is essential and is generally based on local epidemiology and susceptibility/resistance patterns. Response rate to the initial regimen is generally in the range of 75–85%. Fungal infections develop in patients with prolonged neutropenia (greater than 7–10 days). Candida species and Aspergillus species are the predominant fungal pathogens, although many other fungi are opportunistic pathogens in this setting. Fungal infections are seldom documented microbiologically or on histopathology, and the administration of empiric antifungal therapy, when such infections are suspected, is the norm. Therapy is often prolonged, and outcomes are still suboptimal. The importance of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship cannot be overemphasized.

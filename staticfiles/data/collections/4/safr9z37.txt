What is new? KEY FINDINGS: Clinical decision-makers must be informed by the best, most trustworthy, highest-quality, robust evidence. This translates into how much confidence we can have in the research findings and thus be optimally informed for decision-making. The estimates of effect in clinical research depends on the underlying research methodology. COVID-19 disease is presenting global health systems, clinicians, and patients grave challenges. No treatment or prophylaxis currently exists for COVID-19. The overall body of COVID-19 research is very flawed methodologically. An examination of hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin research findings due to the recent media focus revealed very low-quality methodology underpins the research. Vast amounts of time and resources are being allocated to COVID-19 research, and being potentially squandered. WHAT THIS ADDS TO WHAT WAS KNOWN: Flawed methodology and sub-optimal reporting of research findings could lead to biased estimates of effect. This could lead to treatment decisions that are not optimal based on biased estimates which could harm the patient. This article provides specific suggestions for improving on the COVID-19 methods and reporting with a focus on the issues that researchers must consider in their methodology and reporting if we are to have confidence in the estimates of effect. Failure to consider harms in research could be detrimental to the patient. This article focuses on the potential harms when therapeutic agents such as hydroxychloroquine, are being considered. WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION AND WHAT SHOULD CHANGE NOW: Research thus far on finding an optimal therapeutic agent (s) for COVID-19 could be hampered by methodologically flawed research. COVID-19 researchers must immediately and acutely focus on improving their methodology and reporting.

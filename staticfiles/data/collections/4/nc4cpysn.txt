OBJECTIVE Since its discovery, Aichivirus (AiV) A has been detected, with an incidence of 0.9-4.1%, primarily when studying outbreaks of diarrhea in children or young adults. In this paper, we report the first detection of AiV in Piedmont, Italy, in pediatric patients. METHODS A total of 159 fecal specimens (from 96 males and 63 females) previously screened for rotaviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses, human parechoviruses, saliviruses, and sapoviruses were collected from infants and children with acute gastroenteritis. RESULTS The most commonly detected virus was norovirus GII (33.80%), fol lowed by rotavirus (21.30%), astrovirus (18.87%), boca virus (13.92%), sapovirus (10.90%), parechovirus (8%), norovirus GI (6.70%), adenovirus (1%), and salivirus (0.52%). Real-time polymerase chain reaction detected AiV A in 1 (0.62%) case subjects. AiV A was detected in monoinfection only in January. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that AiV may be associated with a limited number of diarrhea cases in pediatric patients.

OBJECTIVE In recent years, improved survival rates of extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs) have led to an increasing number of enterostomy performed for those with meconium obstruction of prematurity (MOP)1,2, spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP)3,4. To prevent serious stoma-related complications such as stoma side perforation, prolapse, fall and surgical site infection, we introduce our new "sutureless enterostomy" technique. METHODS We present the procedures in detail. We reviewed the medical records of twelve patients who underwent "sutureless enterostomy" in our neonatal intensive care unit from 2007 to 2013. Patient attributes, surgery-related items, stoma-related complications and outcomes were investigated. RESULTS Mean birth weight was 671±158g (mean±S.D.). Six cases of MOP, three cases of SIP and three cases of NEC were diagnosed. Mean operative time was 75±35min (mean±S.D.) None of them presented any of early stoma-related complications (necrosis, fall, and surgical site infection). However the parastomal hernia occurred in one patient as late complication. Three deaths occurred postoperatively as a result of exacerbations of their conditions. CONCLUSIONS Based on our preliminary observations, our new "sutureless enterostomy" was done safely and reduced the risk of stoma-related complications. It may be an ideal procedure for the ELBWI with MOP or SIP.

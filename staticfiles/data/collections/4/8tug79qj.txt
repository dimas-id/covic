BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and conventional laparoscopy in ectopic pregnancies accompanied by severe hemoperitoneum. MATERIAL AND METHODS The main outcome measures were duration of surgery, intraoperative bleeding quantity, complications, post-operative pain scores, additional analgesic requirements, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS A total of 53 women, 28 in the conventional laparoscopy group and 25 in the SILS group, participated in the study. There were no differences in demographic characteristics between the two groups. There were no differences in terms of variables including gestational week, beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²hCG) levels, and operation time. No intraoperative complications were observed in either group. The groups exhibited no significant differences regarding additional analgesic requirements or postoperative pain scores. However, pain at the sixth postoperative hour was lower in the SILS group. This effect was not observed at 12 and 24 hours. CONCLUSION SILS appears to be effective and safe for the treatment of ruptured ectopic pregnancies accompanied by hemoperitoneum.

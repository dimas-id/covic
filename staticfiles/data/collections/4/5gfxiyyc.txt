BACKGROUND Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is an uncommon thyroid malignancy with a poor prognosis. American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines acknowledge the complexity of airway management in these patients. We studied our local experience with the aim of providing guidance in airway management in ATC. METHODS Patients with histologically confirmed ATC from January 2004 to December 2011 were identified from our institutional database. The data were retrospectively analyzed using hospital case notes. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were identified with ATC, 25 of who died from the disease. Five of 26 patients (19%) had stridor at presentation. A further 6 of 26 patients (23%) developed stridor during or soon after radiotherapy. Nine patients (36%) died of airway obstruction. CONCLUSION Tracheotomy can facilitate completion of palliative treatment in those patients with ATC and stridor. Given the short life expectancy of these patients, a balanced decision must be made regarding the role and timing of tracheotomy.

Covid­19 origin and transmission to humans. Covid­19 infection began in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019. Although to date it is considered that Covid­19 originates from bats (96.2% overall genome sequence identity) (1), the type of intermediate animals that caused the transmission to humans remains unknown (2-4). Zhou et al (1) mentioned that 'Direct contact with intermediate host animals or consumption of wild animals was suspected to be the main route of SARS­CoV­2 transmission. However, the source(s) and transmission routine(s) of SARS­CoV­2 remain elusive' (1).

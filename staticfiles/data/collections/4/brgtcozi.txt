The complement system is a critical component of both innate and adaptive immune responses. It has both protective and pathogenic roles in viral infections. There are no studies regarding the role of complement system in Chandipura virus (CHPV) infection. The current study has investigated the role of complement pathways in the in vitro neutralization of CHPV in Vero E6 cells. Using normal human serum (NHS), heat-inactivated serum (HIS), human serum deficient of complement factor, respective reconstituted serum, assays like in vitro neutralization, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry-based tissue culture-based limited dose assay (TC-LDA) were carried out for assessing the activation of different complement pathways. NHS from 9/10 donors showed complement dependent neutralization, reduction in viral load and decrease in percentage of CHPV-positive cells compared to their HIS counterparts. EGTA or EDTA pretreatment experiments indicated that CHPV neutralization proceeds through the alternative pathway of the complement activation. Our data showed a strong dependence on C3 for the in vitro neutralization of CHPV. Disparity in CHPV neutralization levels between factor B-deficient and reconstituted sera could be attributed to amplification loop/“tick-over” mechanism. Assays using C3, C5, and C8 deficient sera indicated that complement-mediated CHPV neutralization and suppression of CHPV infectivity are primarily through C3 and C5, and not dependent on downstream complement factor C8. With no specific anti-viral treatment/vaccine against Chandipura, the current data, elucidating role of human complement system in the neutralization of CHPV, may help in designing effective therapeutics.

Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Here we show that such seasonality, as well as the distribution of viral disease's epidemics with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.

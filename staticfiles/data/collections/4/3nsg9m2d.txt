We study clockability for Ordinal Turing Machines (OTMs). In particular, we show that, in contrast to the situation for ITTMs, admissible ordinals can be OTM-clockable, that [Formula: see text]-admissible ordinals are never OTM-clockable and that gaps in the OTM-clockable ordinals are always started by admissible limits of admissible ordinals. This partially answers two questions in [3].

We read with interest the report from Fogarty and colleagues about COVID-19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients. [1] However, we think that some aspects of this report may deserve further attention. The major concern regards the doses of low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) used for thromboprophylaxis in this study. Indeed, the Authors report on a weight-adjusted dose of enoxaparin higher than that registered in Europe for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized acutely ill medical patients.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. With no standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to identify therapies that may be effective in treatment. Recent evidence has implicated the development of cytokine release syndrome as the major cause of fatality in COVID-19 patients, with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) observed in patients. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is an animal lectin that has been implicated in the disease process of a variety of inflammatory conditions. Inhibitors of the small molecule Gal-3 have been shown to reduce the levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α in vitro and have shown anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Additionally, a key domain in the spike protein of β-coronaviridae, a genus which includes SARS-CoV2, is nearly identical in morphology to human Gal-3. These spike proteins are critical for the virus’ entry into host cells. Here we provide a systematic review of the available literature and an impetus for further research on the use of Gal-3 inhibitors in the treatment of COVID-19. Further, we propose a dual mechanism by which Gal-3 inhibition may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19, both suppressing the host inflammatory response and impeding viral attachment to host cells.

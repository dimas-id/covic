Metal-organic frameworksâ€™ (MOFs) adsorption potential is significantly reduced by turning the original powder into pellets or granules, a mandatory step for their use at industrial scale. Pelletization is commonly performed by mechanical compression, which often induces the amorphization or pressure-induced phase transformations. The objective of this work is the rigorous study of the impact of mechanical pressure (55.9, 111.8 and 186.3 MPa) onto three commercial materials (Basolite C300, F300 and A100). Phase transformations were determined by powder X-ray diffraction analysis, whereas morphological changes were followed by nitrogen physisorption. Methane adsorption was studied in an atmospheric fixed bed. Significant crystallinity losses were observed, even at low applied pressures (up to 69.9% for Basolite C300), whereas a structural change occurred to Basolite A100 from orthorhombic to monoclinic phases, with a high cell volume reduction (13.7%). Consequently, adsorption capacities for both methane and nitrogen were largely reduced (up to 53.6% for Basolite C300), being related to morphological changes (surface area losses). Likewise, the high concentration of metallic active centers (Basolite C300), the structural breathing (Basolite A100) and the mesopore-induced formation (Basolite F300) smooth the dramatic loss of capacity of these materials.

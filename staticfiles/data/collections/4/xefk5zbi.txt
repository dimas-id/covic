During an investigation into the population decline of rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome) on Campbell Island, New Zealand, avian cholera (Pasteurella multocida) was found in dead adults and chicks. An RNA enveloped virus was isolated from Ixodes uriae, a tick which commonly parasitizes rockhopper penguins on the island. It is not known whether this virus is virulent for penguins. No evidence was obtained to suggest that avian cholera was the principal cause for the decline in the rockhopper penguin population.

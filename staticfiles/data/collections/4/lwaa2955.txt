Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic, multisystem disease due to defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel responsible for chloride and bicarbonate trafficking. Although this channel is expressed in many tissues, its impaired function in airway epithelial cells leads to hyperviscous mucous secretions impeding effective mucociliary clearance. Impaired clearance of inhaled microorganisms results in the establishment of chronic infection, triggering an overexaggerated inflammatory response. The resulting release of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes causes pulmonary damage in the form of bronchiectasis, further impairing mucociliary action, forming a vicious cycle. Subsequent respiratory failure remains the leading cause of death in individuals with CF.

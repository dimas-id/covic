SARS-Cov and SARS-like-CoV were detected in these specimens using diagnostic kit for novel coronavirus N protein (ELISA), SARS-CoV Virus RNA detection kit, fluorescence PCR, Genchip, RT-PCR and cell isolation culture methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION No SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoV were detected in the 3043 samples, indicating the current absence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like-CoV in the bats captured in Guangzhou and its vicinity.

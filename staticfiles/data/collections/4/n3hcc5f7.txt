Solar UV-C photons do not reach Earth's surface, but are known to be endowed with germicidal properties that are also effective on viruses. The effect of softer UV-B/A photons, which reach the Earth$'$s surface, on viruses are instead little studied and highly debated. Here we show that the evolution and strength of the recent SARS-Cov-2 pandemics, might have been modulated by the intensity of UV-B/A Solar radiation hitting different regions of Earth during the diffusion of the outbreak. Our results suggest that Solar UV-B/A may play an important role in planning new strategies of confinement of the epidemics.

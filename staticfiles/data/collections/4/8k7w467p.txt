Many viruses globally shut off host gene expression to inhibit activation of cell-intrinsic antiviral responses. However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for development of new host-targeted antivirals.

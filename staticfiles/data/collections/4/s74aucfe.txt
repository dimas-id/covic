Infectious and noninfectious pulmonary complications are common among HSCT recipients and are the leading cause for respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Unique pulmonary syndromes include peri-engraftment respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation after HSCT continues to be associated with a poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND Endoscopic vacuum therapy is a novel option for the management of esophageal leaks. This study compares endoscopic vacuum therapy versus placement of covered stents for anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy. METHODS N = 45 consecutive patients with anastomotic leaks following esophagectomy (including patients referred to our center from other hospitals for complication management) were managed by endoscopic therapy at our institution from January 2009 to February 2015. Outcomes of stent and endoscopic vacuum therapy were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Thirty patients received endoscopic stent placement and 15 endoscopic vacuum therapy. In the stent group, seven patients were switched to endoscopic vacuum and four to surgery. Classified by type of initial endoscopic therapy, the success rate (anastomotic healing, patient recovered) was higher for endoscopic vacuum therapy (endoscopic vacuum 93.3%, stent 63.3 %; p = 0.038). Classified by final endoscopic therapy (after switches in therapy), success rates were 86.4 and 60.9% (p = 0.091), respectively. There was no difference observed in mortality, duration of therapy, and length of hospital stay between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic vacuum therapy might be more effective than endoscopic stent placement in the management of esophageal anastomotic leaks.

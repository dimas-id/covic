Understanding COVID-19 and its risk factors in the Portuguese population is critical to combat this condition. To study the impact of multimorbidity in the population with COVID-19 infection, we performed a descriptive analysis of a dataset extracted from all reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Portugal until April 28, 2020. We observed a prevalence of multimorbidity in 4.49% of the 19,598 infected patients. Patients showed an increased risk of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality with OR 2.70 (CI 95%: 2.52-2.88) for every additional morbidity. Further studies should confirm these findings and special attention should be made on data collection to ensure proper recording of patient comorbidities.

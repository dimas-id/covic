OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical and histologic ocular anatomy of the black-tailed prairie dog (PD). ANIMALS STUDIED Seventeen captive black-tailed PDs (11 males and six females), ranging in age from approximately 4 months to 4.5 years. PROCEDURES Complete ocular examinations, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. The globes (n = 2) of one black-tailed PD were harvested immediately after euthanasia and processed after formalin fixation. Staining with hematoxylin-eosin, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, glial fibrillary acidic protein, chromogranin A, claudin-5, smooth muscle actin, and vimentin was performed for light microscopic evaluation. RESULTS A thick mucinous precorneal tear film was present on the ocular surface. A vestigial nictitating membrane was identified in the medial canthus area. The limbus was heavily pigmented, the iris was a dark homogenous brown, and the pupil was round. Funduscopically, there was no tapetum lucidum, the retinal vascular pattern was holangiotic, and a horizontally elongated optic disk was visualized. The most common ocular abnormalities were acquired eyelid margin defects, present in seven eyes of six black-tailed PDs (35.3%). On histologic examination, the retina was asymmetric, thicker below the optic disk and thinner above it. CONCLUSIONS The black-tailed PD fundus is atapetal with a holangiotic retinal vessel pattern and a horizontally elongated optic disk. Acquired lesions of the peri-ocular and eyelid region were the most common documented abnormality. Unique anatomic features of the globe and adnexa were confirmed with histologic and immunohistochemical analysis.

Following the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the Covid-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, health organisations and staff have had to adapt and restructure services in order to respond to this global health emergency. Numerous containment strategies have been, and continue to be, introduced in this rapidly evolving and fluid situation with a significant shift towards virtual or remote patient assessment. The concept of virtual patient evaluation has previously been adopted across a range of medical and surgical specialities yielding safe and efficient pathways associated with good Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and patient satisfaction rates. Whilst the idea of virtual patient review may be perceived as counterintuitive to the basic foundations and principles of face-to-face clinical practice, the current global pandemic, now more than ever, highlights the importance, need and benefits of this care model.

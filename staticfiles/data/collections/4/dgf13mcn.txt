Abstract Yellow head virus (YHV) is an invertebrate nidovirus that is highly pathogenic for marine shrimp. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the YHV ORF2 gene encodes a basic protein (pI =9.9) of 146 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 16,325.5Da. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated a predominance of basic (15.1%), acidic (9.6%) and hydrophilic polar (34.3%) residues and a high proportion proline and glycine residues (16.4%). The ORF2 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a M r =21kDa His6-protein that reacted with YHV nucleoprotein (p20) monoclonal antibody. Segments representing the four linear quadrants of the nucleoprotein were also expressed in E. coli as GST-fusion proteins. Immunoblot analysis using YHV polyclonal rabbit antiserum indicated the presence of linear epitopes in all except the V37â€“Q74 quadrant. Immunoblot analysis of the GST-fusion proteins and C-terminally truncated segments of the nucleoprotein allowed mapping of YHV monoclonal antibodies Y19, Y20 and YII4 to linear epitopes in the acidic domain between amino acids I116 and E137. The full-length nucleoprotein was expressed at high level in E. coli and was easily purified in quantity from the soluble cell fraction by Ni+-NTA affinity chromatography.

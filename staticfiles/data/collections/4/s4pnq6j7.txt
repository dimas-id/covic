Abstract Various phytochemicals have been reported to protect against oxidative stress. However, the mechanism underlying has not been systematically evaluated, which limited their application in disease treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2−related factor 2 (Nrf2), a central transcription factor in oxidative stress response related to numerous diseases, is activated after dissociating from the cytoskeleton−anchored Kelch−like ECH−associated protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1–Nrf2 protein–protein interaction has become an important drug target. This study was designed to clarify whether antioxidantive phytochemicals inhibit the Keap1–Nrf2 protein–protein interaction and activate the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway efficiently. Molecular docking and 3D−QSAR were applied to evaluate the interaction effects between 178 antioxidant phytochemicals and the Nrf2 binding site in Keap1. The Nrf2 activation effect was tested on a H2O2−induced oxidative−injured cell model. Results showed that the 178 phytochemicals could be divided into high−, medium−, and low−total−score groups depending on their binding affinity with Keap1, and the high−total−score group consisted of 24 compounds with abundant oxygen or glycosides. Meanwhile, these compounds could bind with key amino acids in the structure of the Keap1−Nrf2 interface. Compounds from high−total−score group show effective activation effects on Nrf2. In conclusion, phytochemicals showed high binding affinity with Keap1 are promising new Nrf2 activators.

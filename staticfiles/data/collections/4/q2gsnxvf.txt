BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow disruption with the WEB-DL device has been used safely for the treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. The stability of aneurysm occlusion after this treatment was evaluated in the short and midterm, but not in the long term. This retrospective multicenter European study is the continuation of an already published series dealing with short- and midterm anatomic results and analyzes long-term data in patients treated with the WEB-DL. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve European neurointerventional centers initially participated in the study. In addition to data collected for the initial publication, images obtained at long-term follow-up were collected and independently analyzed by the same experienced interventional neuroradiologist. RESULTS Of the initial 45 patients, 26 (20 women and 6 men; 35-73 years of age; mean, 55.2 Â± 10.6 years; median, 55.5 years) with 26 aneurysms treated with the WEB-DL device had long-term follow-up (median, 27.4 months). Three of 26 patients (11.5%) were retreated between short- and midterm follow-up, and none, between mid- and long-term follow-up. Long-term aneurysm occlusion in the 19 patients treated with the WEB only and not retreated during follow-up was complete occlusion in 13/19 patients (68.4%), including aneurysms with opacification of the proximal recess in 9/19 patients (47.4%), neck remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 3/19 patients (15.8%). In all patients (100.0%), aneurysm occlusion was stable between midterm and long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that WEB treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms offers long-term stable occlusion.

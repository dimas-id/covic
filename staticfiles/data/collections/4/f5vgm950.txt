In some countries, leaves of Vitis vinifera grapes have been used for food and for treating many medical disorders. However, there are no studies on the leaves of Vitis labrusca, the main species used for wine and juice production in South America. In this work, the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of organic and conventional grape leaves extracts prepared from V. labrusca (var. Bordo) in brain tissues (in vitro model) have been evaluated. Both organic and conventional grape leaves extracts have similar total phenolic content, however, different patterns were observed for the main phenolic compounds of both kinds of leaves. The organic leaves extract showed about 10 times more resveratrol than the conventional one. Both extracts were able to reduce the lipid and protein damages induced by hydrogen peroxide in the brain of rats. This effect was accompanied by the reversion of the hydrogen peroxide-induced alterations in the superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Negative correlations between lipid and protein damages and the levels of polyphenols were found, suggesting that these compounds contribute directly to the protective effect observed.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by mycoplasmas is very rare. This report describes a severe case of atypical pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae in a formerly healthy young woman who developed high grade fever and cough leading to severe disseminated lung disease and finally to fatal ARDS. This case came into picture when killer atypical pneumonia, namely, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), spread very fast from South-Asian countries to the rest of the world. Moreover, the clinical presentation and radiologic features of SARS bear resemblance to the syndrome of atypical pneumonia, which lead us to investigate this case into detail. We suggest that M. pneumoniae infections should be included in the differential diagnosis of pathogens causing ARDS, establishing an early diagnosis may have important therapeutic implications.

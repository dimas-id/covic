Herein we describe the use of an automated suture fastener (Cor-Knot), recently proposed for valvular surgery, in cases of aortic valve bypass with a Correx apical connector. This surgical option aims to control suture tension, avoid muscular tears, and standardize and simplify the implantation technique. We report the first 5 cases operated on using the new suturing technique.

The Codebook model is one of the popular real-time models for background subtraction to detect moving objects. In this paper, we propose two techniques to adapt the original Codebook algorithm to multispectral images: dynamic mechanism and fusion strategy. For each channel, only absolute spectral value is used to calculate the spectral similarity between the current frame pixel and reference average value in the matching process, which can simplify the matching equations. Besides, the deciding boundaries are obtained based on statistical information extracted from the data and always adjusting themselves to the scene changes. Results demonstrate that with the proposed techniques, we can acquire a comparable accuracy with other methods using the same multispectral dataset for background subtraction.

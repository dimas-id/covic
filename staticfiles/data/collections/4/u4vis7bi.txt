OBJECTIVE Vascular endostaplers are bulky and can be dangerous when dividing small pulmonary arterial (PA) branch vessels during video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy. We aimed to evaluate and compare the immediate efficacy of modern energy sealing devices in an ex vivo PA sealing model. METHODS Patients undergoing anatomical lung resection or lung transplantation were recruited for a prospective cohort pilot study. Four devices were evaluated: Harmonic Ace (Ethicon, Cincinnati, Ohio), Thunderbeat (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), LigaSure (Covidien, Boulder, Colo), and Enseal (Ethicon; Cincinnati, Ohio). After anatomical lung resection, the PA branches were dissected in vitro. Sealing was then performed with 1 of the sealing devices, the vessel was slowly pressurized, and the bursting pressure was recorded. RESULTS Forty-nine PA branches were sealed in 14 patients. The mean PA branch diameter was 7.4 mm (1.8-14.5 mm). Ten patients had normal PA pressure and 3 had PA hypertension. The mean bursting pressure in each was as follows: Harmonic Ace group, 415.5 mm Hg (137.1-1388.4 mm Hg), Thunderbeat group, 875 mm Hg (237.1-2871.3 mm Hg); LigaSure group, 214.7 mm Hg (0-579.6 mm Hg); Enseal group, 133.7 mm Hg (0-315.38 mm Hg). There were 2 complete sealing failures: LigaSure (diameter 6.78 mm) and Enseal (diameter 8.3 mm). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study to examine energy sealing of PA branches in a simulated ex vivo model, vascular sealing using energy was effective and was able to sustain high intraluminal bursting pressures. Further research is needed to determine the in vivo and long-term safety of PA branch energy sealing.

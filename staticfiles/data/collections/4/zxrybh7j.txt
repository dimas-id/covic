In the last few months, a new Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak evolved in America. In accordance, World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2016 declared it as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). ZIKV infection was reported in more than 60 countries and the disease was spreading since 2007 but with little momentum. Many antiviral drugs are available in market or in laboratories under clinical trials, could affect ZIKV infection. In silico docking study were performed on the ZIKV polymerase to test some of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) drugs (approved and in clinical trials). The results show potency of almost all of the studied compounds on ZIKV polymerase and hence inhibiting the propagation of the disease. In addition, the study suggested two nucleotide inhibitors (IDX-184 and MK0608) that may be tested as drugs against ZIKV infection. J. Med. Virol. 88:2044-2051, 2016. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND The role of coronaviruses in paediatric gastro-enteritis is not well defined. We investigated the detection rate and epidemiological features of infection with coronavirus in children receiving hospital care for acute gastro-enteritis in Maddina, Saudi Arabia. METHODS Stool specimens were collected from children less than 5 years of age who were either hospitalised in Maddina or given oral rehydration therapy as outpatients between April 2004 and April 2005. Coronaviruses were detected by electron microscopy. RESULTS Coronaviruses were detected in 63 (6%) of 984 children with acute gastro-enteritis and were more commonly detected in outpatients (47/423, 11%) than in inpatients (16/561, 3%). The median age (range) of children with coronavirus infection was 42 months (10-60). Coronaviruses were detected throughout the year with the highest detection rate at the end of the winter season. CONCLUSIONS Coronaviruses were commonly identified in children with diarrhoea in Saudi Arabia. Their role in paediatric gastro-enteritis warrants further evaluation.

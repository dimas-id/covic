PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the outcomes and complications using cemented megaprosthesis in elderly patients with distal femur nonunions (DFN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2012 and 2016, 24 patients of DFN with an average age of 71.8 years (66–83) and an average 1.9(1–3) prior surgery was managed with distal femur replacement using cemented modular endoprosthesis. Outcomes were analysed on the following criteria: implant status, complications, knee range of motion, Knee Society Score (KSS) and Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. RESULTS: All patients were extremely satisfied with their outcomes. At an average 22.1 months (10–43) follow-up, patients had an average 69.5° (40°-110°) knee flexion, an average KSS of 75.7 (63–88) and an average MSTS score of 19.3 (17–25). Four patients died at an average 21.3 months after surgery due to causes unrelated to the fracture. One patient (4.1%) had implant-related complication; deep infection which required debridement and intravenous antibiotics. There were no late amputations or peri-operative deaths and no patient had aseptic loosening of components. CONCLUSION: By permitting immediate full weight-bearing ambulation and with most patients returning to an acceptable functional status, cemented megaprosthesis is a viable and useful single-stage management option in elderly patients with DFN.

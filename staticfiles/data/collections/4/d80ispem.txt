A novel coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 in February 2020 by World Health organization (WHO) was identified as main cause of SARS like pneumonia cases in Wuhan city in Hubei Province of China at the end of 2019 This been recently declared as Global Pandemic by WHO There is a global emergency to identify potential drugs to treat the SARS-CoV-2 Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus There is a urgency to identifying potential antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed An effective and quick approach is to test existing antiviral drugs against Whole genome analysis and alignment carried out using BLASTn, SMART BLAST and WebDSV 2 0 had shown more than 238 ORF's coding for proteins mostly origin from Bat SARS coronavirus and root genomic origin from Archaea Molecular docking results against protein targets Furin, papain like proteases, RdRp and Spike glycoprotein had shown paritaprevir, ritonavir, entecavir and chloroquine derivatives are the best drugs to inhibit multi targets of coronavirus infection including natural compounds corosolic acid, baicalin and glycyrrhizic acid with minimal inhibitory concentrations Thus we propose use of paritaprevir, entecavir, ritonavir and chloroquine derivatives as best drug combination along with niacinamide, folic acid and zinc supplements to treat novel coronavirus infection We also propose use of plant protease inhibitors (PI's) and Anti-IL8, IL-6, IL-2 as future drug models against coronavirus

Coronary stent dislodgement is a rare but critical complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. It can potentially result in serious consequences, such as stent embolization and emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Here, we describe the successful retrieval of an extracoronary dislodged stent, where dislodgement was induced by a vasodilator used for severe coronary artery spasm caused by Kounis syndrome.

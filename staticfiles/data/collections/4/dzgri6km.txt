PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The management of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) can be complex and challenging due to the myriad of complications they can experience. The continued use of corticosteroids, in addition to the rise of combination immunosuppressive therapy, has contributed to the ongoing concern for infection. Perhaps the most feared infection in IIM patients is Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) given its infrequent occurrence yet high mortality. The field has been, and continues to be, without evidence-based guidelines to help clinicians determine which patients with IIM to prescribe prophylaxis. Herein, we review this literature to provide the clinician with an up-to-date view of infections in IIM. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past 5 years, a number of studies have been reported highlighting various infectious complications, which help us better understand their frequency and associated risk factors. In addition, data has been published on the potential harms of PJP prophylaxis, to better inform the risk/benefit of our decision-making. SUMMARY: Infection remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in IIM. A better understanding of which patient subgroups are at risk for particular infections will inform optimal management strategies.

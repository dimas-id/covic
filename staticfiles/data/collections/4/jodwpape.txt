CASE DESCRIPTION A 10-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat with a 1-week history of vomiting, lethargy, and anorexia was examined. CLINICAL FINDINGS Abdominal radiography and ultrasonography revealed that calculi and a nonpatent stricture obstructed the right ureter, which resulted in secondary dilatation of the ureter proximal to the obstruction and severe hydronephrosis. The left kidney was small and suspected to be failing. Concentrations of BUN and creatinine were elevated. Despite administration of fluids, azotemia persisted. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Surgery was performed. The obstructed right ureter was replaced with a vascularized segment of ileum. Azotemia resolved, and the cat improved with regard to clinical signs. The cat was clinically normal for > 36 months after the surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE An ileal graft can successfully be used as a surgical option for ureteral obstruction in cats.

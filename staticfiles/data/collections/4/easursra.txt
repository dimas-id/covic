The first cases of the novel influenza A(H1N1) virus were reported in April 2009, especially in Mexico and the United States [1, 2]. The disease spread rapidly, becoming a pandemic by June 2009. On August 21, 2009, a total of 177 reported cases of novel influenza 182.166 A(H1N1) infection, of which 1,799 were fatal [2]. It has been observed in animal studies that the novel influenza virus A has a high replication rate in lung tissue, with a great capacity to invade the lower respiratory tract in humans, causing especially acute fulminant respiratory failure.

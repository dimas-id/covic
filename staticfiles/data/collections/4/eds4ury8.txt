Since the identification of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) in 1998, RNAi has become an effective tool to inhibit gene expression. The inhibition mechanism is triggered by introducing a short interference double-stranded RNA (siRNA,19~27 bp) into the cytoplasm, where the guide strand of siRNA (usually antisense strand) binds to its target messenger RNA and the expression of the target gene is blocked. RNAi has been widely applied in gene functional analysis, and as a potential therapeutic strategy in viral diseases, drug target discovery, and cancer therapy. Among the factors which may compromise inhibition efficiency, how to design siRNAs with high efficiency and high specificity to its target gene is critical. Although many algorithms have been developed for this purpose, it is still difficult to design such siRNAs. In this review, we will briefly discuss prediction methods for siRNA efficiency and the problems of present approaches.

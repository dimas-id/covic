The goal of this work is to make a contribution to the development of computationally efficient multirate Electrocardiogram (ECG) automated detectors of arrhythmia. It utilizes an intelligent combination of multirate denoising plus wavelet decomposition for an effective realization of the ECG wireless implants. The decomposed signal subband features are mined and in next step these are utilized by the mature k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier for arrhythmia diagnosis. The multirate nature substantially reduces the processing activity of the system and thus allows a dramatic decrease in energy consumption compared to traditional counterparts. The performance of the system is estimated also in terms of the classification performance. Obtained results reveal an overall 22.5-fold compression gain and 4-folds processing outperformance over the traditional equals while securing 93.2% highest classification accuracy and specificity of 0.956. Findings confirm that the proposed solution could potentially be embedded in contemporary automatic and mobile cardiac diseases diagnosis systems.

The sensitivity and specificity of recombinant open reading frame 5 products used in the Western blotting assay for confirmation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) serologic status were evaluated. The recombinant antigen-based assays were specifically compared with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for PRRSV antibodies using 1) PRRSV antibody-negative reference sera (n = 30), 2) naturally infected pig sera (n = 40), 3) sequential sera obtained from 24 experimentally infected pigs, and 4) sera submitted to 3 state diagnostic laboratories (n = 200). The recombinant antigen assay yielded an average increased sensitivity of 10% over the commercial PRRSV ELISA. The negative controls (group 1 sera) showed no difference between the 2 assays. This comparison confirmed that the recombinant antigen-specific assay was more sensitive than the commercial ELISA and is well suited for routine confirmation of the presence of PRRSV antibodies.

Abstract The emergence and global spread of human infectious diseases has become one of the most serious public health threats of the 21st century. Sophisticated computer simulations have become a key tool for understanding and predicting disease spread on a global scale. Combining theoretical insights from nonlinear dynamics, stochastic processes and complex network theory these computational models are becoming increasingly important in the design of efficient mitigation and control strategies and for public health in general.

In clinical practice, a rapid and accurate identification of pathogens causing viral respiratory tract infections can be problematic because of nonspecific clinical presentations, lack of rapid and sensitive tests, and the emergence of new and mutating viral pathogens. Nucleic acid-targeted molecular techniques are increasingly being used to provide high sensitivity and specificity, short test turnaround time, and automatic and high-throughput processing. In-house and commercially available molecular methods have been developed to qualitatively and quantitatively detect and identify a single or a panel of clinically encountered respiratory tract viruses in a single reaction. Molecular techniques are being gradually introduced in routine laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections. However, their performance characteristics and limitations must be clearly understood by both laboratory personnel and clinicians to ensure proper utilization and interpretation.

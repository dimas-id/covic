MHV-A59 coronavirus infection produces a transient episode of demyelination that is followed by spontaneous remyelination. This paradigm provides a complex lesion environment to examine cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in successful CNS remyelination. Our work in this model has focused on the roles of platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 in regulating oligodendrocyte progenitor responses required for remyelination.

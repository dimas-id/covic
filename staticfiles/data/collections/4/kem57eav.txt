Abstract Background Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has recently emerged as a cause of respiratory infections in hematological patients. Clinical data are lacking to guide the management of HMPV pneumonias. Objectives To characterize the clinical and radiographic presentation and outcome of HMPV pneumonias diagnosed in hematological patients. Study design We screened the patients with a positive HMPV respiratory test in two French teaching hospitals between 2007 and 2011. Among them, the medical charts from the hematological patients who presented with HMPV pneumonia were reviewed. Results Among the 54 patients with several underlying hematological conditions who were positive for HMPV, we found 13 cases of HMPV pneumonias. HMPV could be the cause of pneumonia as a single pathogen without associated upper respiratory infection. Centrilobular nodules were constant on lung computed tomography scans. No patients died despite the absence of administration of antiviral treatments. Conclusions Our data provide further insights in the diagnosis and management of HMPV pneumonias in this setting.

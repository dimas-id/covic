The bovine respiratory disease complex continues to be an economically important syndrome in an era when immunologic control is likely to become increasingly important. Recent studies have yielded a better understanding of the interaction, at the molecular level, of various pathogens with the bovine immune system. Improved challenge models for important viral pathogens such as bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus have provided evidence of the efficacy of immune responses stimulated by vaccination. This article highlights recent advances in understanding of the role of the immune response in the pathogenesis and prophylaxis of bovine respiratory disease complex.

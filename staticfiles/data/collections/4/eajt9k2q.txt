In this paper, we report the first case of a robot-assisted thoracoscopic resection of intralobar sequestration. By virtue of greater dexterity and three-dimensional visualization, the da Vinci robot enables a safer, more precise dissection of sequestered tissue in the face of chronic inflammatory adhesions than conventional video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery does. Thus, in expert hands, such robotic technology is likely to result in less bleeding complications and less conversions to open surgery in cases of sequestration.

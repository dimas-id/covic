Interferon was induced in two groups of swine lymphocyte antigen (SLA)-defined miniature pigs with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose. The group 1 pigs were low antibody-response phenotypes (SLA(a/a), SLA(a/c), SLA(c/c)), and the group 2 pigs were high antibody-response phenotypes (SLA(d/d), SLA(d/g), SLA(g/g)). Six hours after induction the antiviral titres were not influenced by the SLA group, but higher titres were observed in females. Higher antiviral titres were found in group 2 pigs before treatment and 24 hours after treatment, and higher titres were found in female pigs. The antiviral titres before and after treatment were also influenced by the sire. Group 2 pigs had lower total leucocyte counts before treatment, and there was a significant reduction in leucocyte numbers in both groups six hours after induction, due mainly to a large reduction in lymphocyte counts.

We investigated the relation between PCR examination rate among population and the success of containment of COVID-19. Although there was moderate negative correlation, the effect cannot be separated from that of Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), which may well be related to the strict compliance to social distancing. Close inspection of individual countries suggested that the social distancing is the largest factor to achieve containment, and the contribution of broad PCR tests is smaller.

BACKGROUND Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in children is a rare diagnosis. Little is known about factors determining AVM rupture and appropriate treatment strategies to prevent hemorrhage and associated disability. Available data suggest that children are subject to an increased risk for AVM rupture compared with adults. METHODS In 46 pediatric patients with AVM, demographic factors, clinical presentation, angioarchitectural features, and treatment regimens as well as clinical and radiologic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. First-line treatment option was microsurgical resection of the disease, with or without preoperative embolization. RESULTS Twenty-four boys (52.2%) and 22 girls (47.8%) with a mean age on admission of 12.4 years (4-18 years) were included. Mean follow-up was 4 years (median, 1.5; range, 0.1-16.4). Thirty-one children presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (67.4%). Small AVMs (<3 cm) ruptured in 83.3% (n = 25) and were shown to be more prone to hemorrhage than larger ones (P < 0.01). Small AVM size (P < 0.01; odds ratio [OR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.59) and exclusive deep venous drainage (P < 0.01; OR, 29.74; 95% CI, 2.45-4445.34) were independent risk factors for hemorrhage in the presented cohort. Good long-term outcome was associated with a high score on the Glasgow Coma Scale on admittance (P < 0.05; OR, 0.148; 95% CI, 0.03-0.73). CONCLUSIONS Two-thirds of children with AVM are admitted with intracerebral hemorrhage. Microsurgical resection was successful as confirmed by radiologic studies in 95%, and 79.5% of patients presented in a good clinical condition on follow-up (modified Rankin Scale 0 or 1). Microsurgical treatment is recommended if the lesion is accessible and angioarchitectural risk factors favor definitive treatment.

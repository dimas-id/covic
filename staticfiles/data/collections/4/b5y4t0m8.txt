Abstract Health care systems ideally include universal access to comprehensive prepaid medical care along with health promotion and disease prevention. National health insurance and national health services of various models have evolved in the developed world and increasingly in developing countries as well. Some models, such as the Bismarckian social security model and the Bereidge National Health Service model, or National Health insurance such as in pioneered in Canada, are used by a number of countries. The common features are based on principles of national responsibility and solidarity for health, social solidarity for providing funding and searching for effective ways of providing care. Various universal systems of health coverage exist in all industrialized countries, except in the United States which has a mix of public and private insurance but with high percentages of uninsured and poorly insured. Health reform is a continuing process as all countries aspire to assure health care for all. Aging populations, increasing costs, advancing and increasing technology all require nations to modify and adapt organization and financing systems of health care, health protection and promotion.

As mortality due to AIDS-related causes has decreased with the use of antiretroviral therapy, there has been a rise in deaths related to non-AIDS-defining illnesses. Given the exceedingly high prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals living with HIV infection, tobacco has been implicated as a major contributor to this paradigm shift. Evidence suggests that smoking-related illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory illnesses, and certain malignancies, contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons. In this review, we summarize the adverse health consequences of smoking relevant to HIV-infected individuals and discuss smoking cessation in this unique population, including a discussion of barriers to quitting and a review of studies that have examined smoking cessation interventions.

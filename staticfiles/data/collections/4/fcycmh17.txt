It is estimated that more than 300,000 people have died because of COVID-19 globally. The vast majority of documented deaths have occurred within hospitals, leading to psychological impacts on both family members and health care workers. This paper describes the actions (online death notification education, remote crisis intervention, and support for health care professionals) taken at a hospital in Mexico to address the psychological impacts of the notification of a COVID-19-related death on both the deceased's relatives and the health care personnel involved.

Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common infectious disease in humans worldwide The morbidity and mortality rates are high, especially in developing countries from Southeast Asia and Africa While ARTI is commonly associated with viruses, there is limited data on the spectrum of viruses causing ARTI in developing countries, including Indonesia This study was based on utilizing molecular techniques targeting a panel of 11 endemic and emerging respiratory viral pathogens including zoonotic viruses in a cohort of children and adults presenting at Tabanan General Hospital, Bali, with acute respiratory illness, from January to November 2017 In total, 98 out of 200 samples (49 0 %) tested positive for viruses Our study confirmed 64 3 % viral etiology in children and 12 2 % in adults Viruses that were detected were Herpesviridae (15 0 %) followed by enteroviruses (12 0 %), influenza A virus (11 5 %), respiratory syncytial virus (8 0 %), Adenoviridae (6 5 %), human metapneumovirus (3 5 %), Paramyxoviridae (2 0 %), bocavirus (1 0 %) and Coronaviridae (0 5 %) The study sheds light on the viral spectrum of ARTI in children and adults in Tabanan, Bali, Indonesia

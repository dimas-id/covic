Abstract Clinical management of captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) plays a key role in maintaining a healthy ex situ breeding population, and aids in the conservation of cheetahs in the wild. Cheetahs are prone to noninfectious disorders, as well as multiple infectious diseases that can lead to increased morbidity and decreased reproductive success. Proper management in a captive setting consists of a well-designed cheetah facilities adapted for the institutionâ€™s housing and animal movement needs. Breeding facilities should be designed to hold a large number of cheetahs and to provide the best care possible for both the adults and cubs. A thorough cheetah preventative health program should be in place. Breeding facilities should also be prepared for the potential of hand-rearing cubs.

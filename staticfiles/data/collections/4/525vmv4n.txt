Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease of unknown aetiology and probably a new strain of coronavirus is thought to be responsible for the disease. After originating from south-east China it has spread to several countries across the world. Patients of SARS suffer from fever with cough and dyspnoea. The virus spreads by droplet to nearby contacts and has high tendency to spread to the healthcare providers. Since the aetiology is not yet clear exact treatment is not yet defined and hence prevention is of utmost importance.

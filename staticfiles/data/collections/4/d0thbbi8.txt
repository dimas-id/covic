As the spread of COVID-19 has led to global efforts to social distance, concerns about the negative psychological effects of social isolation and loneliness have grown. The purpose of this commentary is to draw attention to 2 populations across the life span at risk for the psychological sequelae of social isolation and loneliness: young adults and old-old adults. We present data from three population-based longitudinal studies from two nations (United States and Sweden) to support this view. We then provide recommendations for the prevention of loneliness during social distancing as well as after social distancing measures are eased through implementation of programs that match young adults with older adults to foster intergenerational connection and group-based psychotherapy.

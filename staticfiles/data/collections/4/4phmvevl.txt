Wandering spleen is a rare condition in which the spleen lacks retroperitoneal fixation, thus its vascular pedicle can twist resulting in ischemia. Although splenectomy has traditionally been used for this condition, splenopexy is increasingly used in the pediatric population to anchor the spleen and preserve splenic function. We report an unusual case of wandering spleen in an adult with chronic torsion managed with laparoscopic splenopexy, suggesting splenic preservation is possible in adults with this presentation as well.

The entry of enveloped viruses involves virus adsorption followed by close apposition of the viral and plasma membranes. This multistep process is initiated by specific binding interactions between glycoproteins in the viral envelope and appropriate receptors on the cell surface. In the case of HIV-1, attachment of virions to the cell surface is attributed to a high affinity interaction between envelope spike glycoproteins (Env, composed of the surface protein gp120 and the transmembrane protein gp41) and a complex made of the primary CD4 receptor and a seven-transmembrane co-receptor (e.g., CXCR4 or CCR5) (reviewed in [1]). Then a chain of dynamic events take place that enable the viral nucleocapsid to penetrate within the target cell following the destabilization of membrane microenvironment and the formation of a fusion pore.

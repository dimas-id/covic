An “outbreak” of juvenile diabetes mellitus: consideration of a viral etiology. Am J Epidemiol 100:277–287. 1974.—Nine of twelve cases of juvenile diabetes mellitus, representing an unusual geographic and temporal cluster, were investigated for evidence that a specific viral infection might be etiologically related to their occurrence. Eight diabetics had experienced recent “viral-like” illnesses, predominantly repiratory, but these illnesses bore no uniform temporal relation to their onsets of diabetes. Diabetics demonstrated no serologic evidence of a recent viral illness common to all. Elevated titers to only one virus, coxsackie B-3, were more prevalent in diabetics than in controls (33% vs. 6%), but geometric mean titers of diabetics to a panel of 26 common viral antigens were similar to those of controls. These data neither support nor negate the hypothesis that infection with a specific virus precipitates juvenile diabetes mellitus.

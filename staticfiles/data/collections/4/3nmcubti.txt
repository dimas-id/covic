Previously, we demonstrated that intracerebral (IC) inoculation of a murine coronavirus, MHV-JHM, into two species of primates can result in acute encephalomyelitis (Murray et al., 1992a). Infectious virus isolated from acutely infected animals, designated JHM-OMp1, was inoculated IC into a second group of monkeys. In this report we describe observations on the acutely infected animals and those surviving the acute infection were sacrificed at later times post-infection. Results from dual in situ hybridization/immunohistochemistry screening of tissues show that astrocytes are target cells in white matter lesions during acute infection. In animals sacrificed 150 days post-infection, areas of demyelinated gliotic lesions, prominent in the spinal cord, were seen throughout the neuraxis. No virus products were detected in these late-infection lesions.

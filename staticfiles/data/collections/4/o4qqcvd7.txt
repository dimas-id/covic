Nephron sparing surgery (NSS) is the gold standard treatment option for patients with a solitary kidney in order to preserve renal function. Open partial nephrectomy (OPN) has been long considered the standard care for NSS. Robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) is being gradually used more commonly even for solitary kidney and complex tumors. There was no difference between RPN and OPN regarding the rate of intraoperative-postoperative complications and positive surgical margin (PSM) (RPN: 7.5%, OPN: 8%) for patients with solitary kidney who underwent partial nephrectomy for small renal masses. Warm ischemia time (WIT) in all of our studies was within the safe range of <25 minutes which is acceptable ischemia time for robotic approaches. More studies are needed in order to evaluate kidney function. In conclusion with increasing experience, solitary kidney tumors can be managed safely with robotic approach. For patients having complex tumors with a potential of WIT >25 minutes, administration of intracorporeal ice slush during surgery may be considered.

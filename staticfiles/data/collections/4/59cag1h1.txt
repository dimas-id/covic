INTRODUCTION: As the coronavirus pandemic swept across national and state borders, institutions of higher learning, including cytology, began closing campuses and moving instruction online. We have described a method of remotely teaching cytology in our institution, including using the telecytology concept used with rapid onsite evaluation and remote conferencing and educational tools to conduct eCytology learning. This is a cost-effective method to transition a traditional in-classroom program into online teaching for cytology. It can also be implemented quickly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In March 2020, our cytology program developed a method for teaching cytology remotely. The distance-learning teaching method included the use of remote conferencing (Zoom platform) and learning management platforms (Canvas) to present lectures and administer tests. Remote multihead sessions were conducted by adapting the telecytology rapid onsite evaluation concept, which attaches a mobile device to the microscope to transmit live video to remote learners. RESULTS: When asked about their experience with online learning, the students had responded positively. All the students indicated a willingness to attend classes remotely in the future, even when the traditional in-classroom learning option is available. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented a method for educating students remotely using existing technology that is affordable and can be implemented quickly by nearly all cytology education programs.

Abstract Canine distemper, caused by Canine distemper virus (CDV), is a highly contagious and fatal systemic disease in free-living and captive carnivores worldwide. Accurate, rapid and simple detection of CDV is critical to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks. In this study, a visible and incubation instrument-free reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with lateral flow strip (LFS RT-RPA) was developed to detect CDV using primers and lateral flow (LF) probe specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 Ã— 101 copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay. The performance of the LFS RT-RPA was comparable to real-time RT-PCR, while the LFS RT-RPA assay was much faster and easier to perform. The novel CDV LFS RT-RPA assay provides an attractive and promising tool for rapid and reliable detection of CDV in the underequipped laboratory and point-of-need facility, which is of great significance in CD control in low resource settings.

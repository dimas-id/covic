AIM The aim of this retrospective study was to assess and compare the clinical results of three hysterectomy techniques: abdominal hysterectomy (AH), vaginal hysterectomy (VH), and laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH). METHODS A total of 2163 patients having undergone AH (n = 1226), VH (n = 426), and LH (n = 511) procedures were analyzed. The mean age, body mass index (BMI), parity, uterus weight, operation time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, analgesic needs, intra- and postoperative complications, and indications for hysterectomy were analyzed and compared. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups with respect to the BMI, parity, and intra- or postoperative major and minor complications. The operation time was significantly shorter in the VH group than in the other two groups (p < 0.001), and the blood loss was significantly lower in the LH group than in the others (p < 0.001). The duration of hospitalization and analgesic needs were the shortest in the LH group (p < 0.001), while the uterus weight and previous intra-abdominal surgery rate were the lowest in the VH group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S) Despite the fact that the LH exhibited a longer operation time than the VH, the LH was considered to be a safe and effective surgical procedure due to the lesser blood loss, hospital stay, and analgesic needs.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae Synthesis of the viral RNA is directed by replication/transcription complexes (RTC) that are mainly composed of a network of PRRSV nonstructural proteins (nsps) and likely cellular proteins. Here, we mapped the interaction network among PRRSV nsps by using yeast two-hybrid screening in conjunction with coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and cotransfection assays. We identified a total of 24 novel interactions and found that the interactions were centered on open reading frame 1b (ORF1b)-encoded nsps that were mainly connected by the transmembrane proteins nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5. Interestingly, the interactions of the core enzymes nsp9 and nsp10 with transmembrane proteins did not occur in a straightforward manner, as they worked in the co-IP assay but were poorly capable of finding each other within intact mammalian cells. Further proof that they can interact within cells required the engineering of N-terminal truncations of both nsp9 and nsp10. However, despite the poor colocalization relationship in cotransfected cells, both nsp9 and nsp10 came together with membrane proteins (e.g., nsp2) at the viral replication and transcription complexes (RTC) in PRRSV-infected cells. Thus, our results indicate the existence of a complex interaction network among PRRSV nsps and raise the possibility that the recruitment of key replicase proteins to membrane-associated nsps may involve some regulatory mechanisms during infection.IMPORTANCE Synthesis of PRRSV RNAs within host cells depends on the efficient and correct assembly of RTC that takes places on modified intracellular membranes. As an important step toward dissecting this poorly understood event, we investigated the interaction network among PRRSV nsps. Our studies established a comprehensive interaction map for PRRSV nsps and revealed important players within the network. The results also highlight the likely existence of a regulated recruitment of the PRRSV core enzymes nsp9 and nsp10 to viral membrane nsps during PRRSV RTC assembly.

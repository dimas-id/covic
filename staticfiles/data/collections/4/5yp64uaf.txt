Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are atypical bacteria that are frequently found in patients with asthma. A definitive diagnosis of infection is often difficult to obtain because of limitations with sampling and detection. Numerous animal studies have outlined mechanisms by which these infections may promote allergic lung inflammation and airway remodeling. In addition, there is mounting evidence from human studies suggesting that atypical bacterial infections contribute to asthma exacerbations, chronic asthma, and disease severity. The role of antimicrobials directed against atypical bacteria in asthma is still under investigation.

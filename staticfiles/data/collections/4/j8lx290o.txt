PURPOSE We performed laparoscopic gastrectomy using an umbilical port in addition with one other port (dual-ports laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, DP-LADG) since December 2009. We describe a retrospective study to evaluate the possibility of DP-LADG compared with conventional LADG (C-LADG). METHODS The indication for DP-LADG was preoperative clinical Stage IA gastric cancer. We compared 20 patients who underwent DP-LADG with 24 patients of clinical Stage IA patients who underwent C-LADG. RESULTS The mean operation time was significantly longer for DP-LADG (250.5 min) than for C-LADG (197.5 min); however, the mean operation time for the last 5 patients undergoing DP-LADG (209 Â± 31.1 min) was almost the same as that for C-LADG. There were no significant differences between DP-LADG and C-LADG in terms of blood loss, number of lymph nodes dissected, rates of conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications, and length of postoperative hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS DP-LADG is technically feasible.

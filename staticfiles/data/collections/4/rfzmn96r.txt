We compared simultaneous regional cerebral oxygen saturation and central venous oxygen saturation at different time periods in 20 adult patients (median age, 57.9; range, 35 to 76 years) undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) graft surgery (n= 20). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PcvCO(2)), heart rate, haematocrit (Hct), lactate and patient oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were also recorded as a secondary analysis to determine independent predictors of cerebral desaturation and interactions between predictors. The cross-sectional analysis performed at each time point showed several significant moderate to strong positive correlations between central venous oxygen saturation and both right and left cerebral oxygen saturations; however, right cerebral saturations correlated better with central venous saturations than left cerebral saturation. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PcvCO(2)) was identified as a major predictor of cerebral saturation 0.59 (p < 0.001). Central venous saturation can be used as a surrogate measure of cerebral oxygen saturation during OPCAB surgery.

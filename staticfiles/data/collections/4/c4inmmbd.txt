Governments can intervene to a greater or lesser extent in managing the risks that citizens face They can adopt a maximal intervention approach (e g , COVID‐19) or a hands‐off approach (e g , unemployment), effectively “responsibilizing” their citizens To manage the cyber risk, governments publish cyber‐related policies This article examines the intervention stances the governments adopt in supporting individual citizens managing their personal cyber risk The authors pinpoint the cyber‐related responsibilities that several governments espouse, applying a “responsibilization” analysis Those applying to citizens are identified, thereby revealing the governments' cyber‐related intervention stances The analysis reveals that most governments adopt a minimal cyber‐related intervention stance in supporting their citizens Given the increasing number of successful cyber attacks on individuals, it seems time for the consequences of this stance to be acknowledged and reconsidered The authors argue that governments should support individual citizens more effectively in dealing with cyber threats

Abstract Pandemics and epidemics represent an uncharacterized risk to human healthâ€”ranging from episodic to chronic pathogens and from chronic diseases. Society's capacity to respond to these threats with an even increasing range of pharmaceuticals presents a novel challenge to environmental scientists and public health officials. The environmental and human health risks posed by society's medical response to pandemics and epidemics will be discussed in the context of influenza as a case study and a range of existing pathogen and noncommunicable pathogen risks.

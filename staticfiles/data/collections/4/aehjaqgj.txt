A 20-year-old man presented for outpatient evaluation of treatment options for recurrent respiratory papillomas. He was born with vocal cord paralysis. At 4 weeks of life, he underwent tracheostomy. In childhood his tracheostomy was closed, and he was found to have occasional, small papillomas in the trachea. During puberty, he experienced a dramatic increase in the number and size of the papillomas.

BACKGROUND: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling phospholipid involved in pathophysiologic progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through its roles in endothelial barrier function and immune modulation. We hypothesized that decreased serum S1P level is associated with the clinical outcomes of ARDS and polymorphisms in the S1P gene are associated with serum S1P levels. METHODS: This multicenter prospective study includes ARDS patients and healthy blood donors as controls. Serum S1P levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the S1P gene were detected, and their associations with S1P levels were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 ARDS patients and 100 healthy individuals were enrolled. Serum S1P levels were lower in ARDS patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Decreased S1P levels correlated with more organ dysfunction and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. Changes in S1P levels in ARDS patients were associated with the clinical outcomes. The recessive model for SNP rs3743631 suggests that GG homozygote is associate with a higher risk for ARDS. The dominant model for SNP rs907045 suggests that AA or TA genotype might increase the risk for ARDS. In ARDS patients, the rs3743631 GG genotype showed lower S1P levels than those harboring AG and AA genotypes. The serum S1P levels of rs907045 AA or TA genotype patients were lower than those of TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S1P levels are dramatically decreased in ARDS patients. Reduced S1P levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes. There is a significant association between S1P rs3743631, rs907045 polymorphisms and susceptibility of ARDS.

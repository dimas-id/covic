The rate at which epidemics of zoonotic disease in humans have surfaced over the past 25 years has shaken--some would say shattered--the assumption that zoonotic diseases are under control, says Paul Gibbs. In this review he analyses the global factors that have led to the increased emergence of zoonotic diseases, sketches several recent epidemics (and where relevant, their relationship to bioterrorism), discusses the lessons learned, and concludes by outlining an agenda for action.

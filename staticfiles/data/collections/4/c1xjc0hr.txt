PURPOSE Since thrombectomy has become a standard treatment technique for stroke, there is great demand for well-trained interventionalists. We offer practical courses on both silicone models and porcine models, and conducted a survey to evaluate whether ex vivo training models could replace in vivo models in the future. METHODS In total, 110 neurointerventionalists participating in 30 training courses were included in our survey using a semi-structured questionnaire. RESULTS The level of experience in thrombectomy maneuvers was almost balanced in our sample (52% experienced and 48% less-experienced participants). Silicone models were regarded as useful training tools regardless of the participants' experience (p = 1.000): 94% of less-experienced and 92% of experienced participants considered a silicone model to be a useful introduction for training with animal models. Of the participants, 95% indicated that training on animal models was helpful and necessary, even if they already had experience in performing interventions in humans (p = 1.000). After joining this course, 97% of all participants felt well prepared to perform thrombectomies in humans. CONCLUSION Even experienced participants benefit from silicone models. Silicone models are a good preparation for animal models but cannot replace them. Categorizing participants depending on their experience and their individual needs before practical training may allow for more efficient endovascular training.

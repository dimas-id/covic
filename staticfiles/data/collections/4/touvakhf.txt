The Onyx system has been well established in recent years as a very important material in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). When using the Onyx, it is essential to wait for the creation of a plug around the tip of the catheter, which enables the effective forward penetration of Onyx. Recent reports have shown that the introduction of a dimethyl sulfoxide compatible dual-lumen balloon microcatheter improves the efficiency of AVM embolization. We report our recent experience of two cases of intracranial AVM embolization using Onyx and the transarterial balloon-assisted technique. In both cases, the procedures were successfully performed and the nidus of the AVM was totally occluded in a relatively short time. This technique may enable immediate forward flow and penetration of Onyx without concern about reflux. It may also reduce the procedure time and increase the angiographic occlusion rate. Navigation of the dual-lumen balloon microcatheter nevertheless remains a challenge.

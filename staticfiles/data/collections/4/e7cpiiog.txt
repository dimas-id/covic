Lung transplantation has become a proven therapeutic option for patients with end-stage lung disease, extending life and providing improved quality of life to those who otherwise would continue to be breathless and oxygen-dependent. Over the past 20 years, considerable experience has been gained in understanding the multitude of medical and surgical issues that impact upon patient survival. Today, clinicians have an armamentarium of tools to manage diverse problems such as primary graft dysfunction, acute and chronic allograft rejection, airway anastomotic issues, infectious complications, renal dysfunction, diabetes and osteoporosis, hematological and gastrointestinal problems, malignancy, and other unique issues that confront immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients.

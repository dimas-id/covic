BACKGROUND Multimodal imaging of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) lesions (type 3 neovascularization) and the diagnostic significance of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). MATERIAL AND METHODS Confirmation of the diagnosis in six case reports with fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (FLA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT‑A). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The use of OCT‑A is helpful for the diagnosis and follow-up examinations of RAP lesions (type 3 neovascularization). It enables the detailed visualization of intraretinal and choroidal microcirculation. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the progression, classify the stages and comprehend the treatment strategy.

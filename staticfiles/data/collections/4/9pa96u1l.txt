The TCM protocol in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Trial Version 7) has been updated from previous versions. The protocol was formulated under the direct leadership of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, based on the experience of a panel of experts, supported by evidence from fever clinics and from the outcomes of emergency (EM) observation rooms and inpatients throughout China (especially in Wuhan, Hubei Province) in combination with the latest scientific research results and data. The present interpretation of the TCM protocol is based on an overall understanding of the revised content, and aims to guide and standardize its clinical application to provide a reference for clinicians.

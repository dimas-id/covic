The full-length genome sequence of a variant of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), that of strain CH/JXJA/2017, was highly homologous to CH/ZMDZY/11, a highly virulent Chinese PEDV strain. CH/JXJA/2017 had a distant relationship with the attenuated CV777 vaccine strain, but the insertion sites of the S1 gene were similar to those of the recombinant strain of CH/ZMDZY/11.

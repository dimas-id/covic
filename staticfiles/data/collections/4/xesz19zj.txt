In this study, we use US county-level COVID-19 case data from January 21-March 25, 2020 to study the exponential behavior of case growth at the metropolitan scale. In particular, we assume that all localized outbreaks are in an early stage (either undergoing exponential growth in the number of cases, or are effectively contained) and compare the explanatory performance of different simple exponential and linear growth models for different metropolitan areas. While we find no relationship between city size and exponential growth rate (directly related to $R0$, which denotes average the number of cases an infected individual infects), we do find that larger cities seem to begin exponential spreading earlier and are thus in a more advanced stage of the pandemic at the time of submission. We also use more recent data to compute prediction errors given our models, and find that in many cities, exponential growth models trained on data before March 26 are poor predictors for case numbers in this more recent period (March 26-30), likely indicating a reduction in the number of new cases facilitated through social distancing.

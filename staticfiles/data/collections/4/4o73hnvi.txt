OBJECTIVE To determine which of 3 different plate angles (20°, 25°, 30°) used in double pelvic osteotomy (DPO) would result in the most similar acetabular angle (AA) achieved with a 20° triple pelvic osteotomy (TPO) technique in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Experimental anatomic study. ANIMALS Cadaveric canine pelves (n = 8). METHODS Transverse plane computed tomographic images of cadaveric pelves with intact sacroiliac joints, mounted in a custom jig, were made (baseline) and again after DPO (20°, 25°, 30°) and TPO (20°) and pelvic angles measured in 6 transverse planes. Pelvic angles of the 3 DPO techniques were compared with TPO using concordance correlation to determine which DPO angle resulted in an acetabular ventroversion angle closest to TPO. RESULTS Mean ± SD AAs were 32.89 ± 2.23 (baseline), 47.39 ± 4.39 (20° DPO), 51.43 ± 5.06 (25° DPO), 54.75 ± 4.38 (30° DPO), and 50.20 ± 5.76 (20° TPO). Concordance correlations for the AA compared with 20° TPO were 0.027 (baseline), 0.721 (20° DPO), 0.902 (25° DPO), and 0.593 (30° DPO). A concordance correlation of ≥ 0.8 indicates good correlation. CONCLUSIONS A 25° DPO is most similar in acetabular ventroversion to 20° TPO (concordance correlation, 0.902).

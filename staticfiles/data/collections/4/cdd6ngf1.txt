Abstract BST-2 is an antiviral protein described as a powerful cross-species transmission barrier for simian immunodeficiency viruses. Influenza viruses appear to interact with BST-2, raising the possibility that BST-2 may be a barrier for cross-species transmission. An MDCK-based cell line expressing human BST-2 was generated to study human-derived A/Puerto Rico/8/36 (H1N1; PR8) as well as two low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (subtypes H4N6 and H6N1). The H4N6 and H6N1 viruses were less affected by BST-2 expression than PR8, due to their ability to decrease BST-2 levels, a function localized to the PA segment of both avian viruses. Experiments with PA-mutant and -chimeric viruses confirmed that the avian PA segment conferred BST-2 downregulation and antagonism. These results indicate a species-specific ability of PA from low pathogenic avian viruses to mitigate human BST-2 antiviral activity, suggesting that BST-2 is unlikely to be a general cross-species barrier to transmission of such viruses to humans.

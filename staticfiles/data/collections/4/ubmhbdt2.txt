We described three COVID-19-infected patients with profound immune thrombocytopenia causing haemorrhagic mucocutaneous complications. We conclude that an immune mechanism was responsible as common causes were excluded. Since corticoids were considered harmful in the circumstances, the patients were successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulins without later relapse. LEARNING POINTS: The severity of haemorrhagic syndrome is not correlated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Thrombocytopenia in mild COVID-19 infection seems to have an autoimmune mechanism. Intravenous immunoglobulins (1 g/kg) should be the first line of treatment.

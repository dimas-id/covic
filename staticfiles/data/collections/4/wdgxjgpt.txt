BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is an efficient procedure for remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in morbid obesity. However, in Asian countries, mean body mass index (BMI) of T2DM patients is about 25 kg/m(2). Various data on patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery showed that control of T2DM after surgery occurs rapidly and somewhat independent to weight loss. We hypothesized that in non-obese patients with T2DM, the glycemic control would be achieved as a consequence of gastric bypass surgery. METHODS From September 2009, the 172 patients have had laparoscopic single anastomosis gastric bypass (LSAGB) surgery. Among them, 107 patients have been followed up more than 1 year. We analyzed the dataset of these patients. Values related to diabetes were measured before and 1, 2, and 3 years after the surgery. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased during the first year after the surgery but plateaued after that. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin level decreased continuously. The mean fasting and postglucose loading plasma glucose level also decreased. CONCLUSION After LSAGB surgery in non-obese T2DM patients, the control of T2DM was possible safely and effectively. However, longer follow-up with matched control group is essential.

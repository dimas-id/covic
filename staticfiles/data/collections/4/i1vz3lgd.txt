Parietal cells are responsible for gastric acid secretion, which aids in the digestion of food, absorption of minerals, and control of harmful bacteria. However, a fine balance of activators and inhibitors of parietal cell-mediated acid secretion is required to ensure proper digestion of food, while preventing damage to the gastric and duodenal mucosa. As a result, parietal cell secretion is highly regulated through numerous mechanisms including the vagus nerve, gastrin, histamine, ghrelin, somatostatin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and other agonists and antagonists. The tight regulation of parietal cells ensures the proper secretion of HCl. The H(+)-K(+)-ATPase enzyme expressed in parietal cells regulates the exchange of cytoplasmic H(+) for extracellular K(+). The H(+) secreted into the gastric lumen by the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase combines with luminal Cl(âˆ’) to form gastric acid, HCl. Inhibition of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase is the most efficacious method of preventing harmful gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors and potassium competitive acid blockers are widely used therapeutically to inhibit acid secretion. Stimulated delivery of the H(+)-K(+)-ATPase to the parietal cell apical surface requires the fusion of intracellular tubulovesicles with the overlying secretory canaliculus, a process that represents the most prominent example of apical membrane recycling. In addition to their unique ability to secrete gastric acid, parietal cells also play an important role in gastric mucosal homeostasis through the secretion of multiple growth factor molecules. The gastric parietal cell therefore plays multiple roles in gastric secretion and protection as well as coordination of physiological repair.

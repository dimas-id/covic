Two independent groups last week reported that they had used artificial intelligence in different ways to find possible treatments for the novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV On Feb 4, researchers from the AI drug discovery company BenevolentAI and Imperial College London reported that they had used AI software to find an already-approved drug that might limit the virus’s ability to infect people (Lancet 2020, DOI: 10 1016/S0140-6736(20)30304-4) On Feb 6, Insilico Medicine announced that its AI algorithms had designed new molecules that could stop the virus from replicating in people’s bodies The company says it submitted a paper to the bioRxiv server, but the preprint had not been posted there as of press time BenevolentAI’s algorithms connect molecular structure data to biomedical information about relevant receptors and diseases to find potential drug targets The group adapted its search to newly available information about 2019-nCoV and focused on the enzyme adaptor-associated protein kinase

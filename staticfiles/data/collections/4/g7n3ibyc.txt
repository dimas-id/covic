OBJECTIVES To determine the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other selected axis-I disorders among women with newly diagnosed, untreated endocrine disorders. METHODS Two hundred and eighteen consecutive women, aged 18-65, with newly diagnosed, untreated endocrine disorders were referred for potential diagnosis of co-morbid axis-I disorders with the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I-Patient Edition (SCID-P). The SCID-P was re-administered after 12 weeks. RESULTS At baseline, 64 (29.3%) women met criteria for at least one axis-I disorder. Women who were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism were more likely to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder than women without hyperthyroidism. Nine of 154 (5.8 %) women who did not meet criteria for an axis-I disorder at baseline met criteria for at least one axis-I disorder during follow-up. Among them, the presence of diabetes mellitus was statistically correlated with a higher probability of developing major depressive disorder at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Although preliminary, our findings are consistent with previous studies and suggest an increased prevalence of MDD and other axis-I disorders among women with newly diagnosed endocrine disorders, providing further evidence suggesting that women with endocrine abnormalities may be at increased risk of depression and/or anxiety disorders.

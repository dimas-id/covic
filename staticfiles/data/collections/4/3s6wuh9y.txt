BACKGROUND Ophthalmoplegia secondary to a traumatic dissecting aneurysm in the cavernous segment of internal carotid artery (ICA) is a relatively rare entity. Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy is the preferred treatment option for carotid dissections. However, endovascular interventions are noninvasive and alternative methods to surgery, especially in cases of aneurysms that do not respond to medical therapy. CASE REPORT We report of a 19-year-old man presenting with left-sided, total ophthalmoplegia after a traffic accident. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a dissection beginning at the cervical segment of internal carotid artery (ICA) together with a dissecting aneurysm in the cavernous segment. A stent was placed in the narrowed and dissected segment of ICA, and the dissecting aneurysm of the cavernous segment was successfully managed with a stent-assisted coil embolization. After the endovascular treatment of the aneurysm, a full recovery of cranial nerve function was achieved. CONCLUSIONS Immediate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of dissecting aneurysms is necessary for good clinical outcomes in cases of ophthalmoplegia.

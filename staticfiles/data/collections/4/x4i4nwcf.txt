OBJECTIVE To investigate the risk factors in the dead patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS The retrospective analyses were made on 12 dead cases and 32 recovered cases with SARS. RESULTS The mean age was 67 years old in 12 dead cases with SARS and was 42 in recovered control group. There were 1-5 other basic diseases in 5 cases of death group. The states of dead patients were severe and the deterioration of patients' condition was rapid. The CD 4 and CD 8 T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were (416.6+/-235.0) cells/microl and (296.1+/-181.5)cells/microl in survival patients and (143.8+/-78.1)cells/microl, (103.6+/-63.2) cells/microl in dead patients, they often decreased compared to the normal values, especially in dead cases. Five cases were infected with bacteria in 12 dead cases, among them 3 were infected with fungus and 2 were septicemia. In dead group, the occurrence rates of electrolyte maladjustment and kidney injury were 41.67 percent. Invasive ventilation was used in 10 cases and death rate was 80.0 percent, among them 5 patients were infected with bacteria. None was dead in the patients with non-invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION The age and basic diseases are the main mortal risk factors in SARS. Other risk factors include the decline of immune function, secondary infection, complications and use of invasive ventilation.

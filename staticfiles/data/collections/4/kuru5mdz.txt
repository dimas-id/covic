Abstract The present article reports on an experimental study of the effect of crystallographic orientation of single crystal diamond on ductile material removal of ZnS. A multispectral ZnS workpiece was machined with single crystal diamond tools having two different configurations of cutting plane and cutting direction. An x-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used to evaluate the cutting plane and cutting direction of each tool. It was observed that the tools having a {100} cutting plane and <110> cutting direction resulted in considerably lower tool wear and surface roughness values, to that of tools with similar cutting plane orientation and <100> cutting direction.

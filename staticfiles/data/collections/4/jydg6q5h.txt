Forsythoside A is a polyphenolic constituent of the fruits of Forsythia suspensa Vahl. which is widely used as an antiinflammatory agent in traditional Chinese medicine. In the present study, the effects of forsythoside A on cell infection by avian infectious bronchitis virus were assessed. A real‐time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay was used to determine mRNA content of IBV N gene. The pretreatment of cells with forsythoside A, adding forsythoside A post infection of cells, and treatment of virus with forsythoside A were analysed. The inhibitory effect of forsythoside A was confirmed by infecting primary chicken embryo kidney cells. Infected cells were inhibited by forsythoside A treatment. The data indicated that forsythoside A has the potential to prevent IBV infection in vitro. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

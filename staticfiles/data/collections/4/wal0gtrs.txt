Abstract Saliva is produced by both major (parotid and submandibular and sublingual) and minor (located in the mouth) glands, with different constituents and properties between the two groups. In the mouth saliva is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, watery liquid containing 99% water and 1% organic and inorganic substances and dissolved gases, mainly oxygen and carbon dioxide. Salivary constituents can be grouped into proteins (e.g., amylase and lysozyme), organic molecules (e.g., urea, lipids, and glucose mainly), and electrolytes (e.g., sodium, calcium, chlorine, and phosphates). Cellular elements such as epithelial cells, leukocytes and various hormones, and vitamins have also been detected. The composition of saliva is modified, depending on factors such as secreted amount, circadian rhythm, duration and nature of stimuli, diet, and medication intake, among others.

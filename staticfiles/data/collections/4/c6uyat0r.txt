Sport-related injury patterns among Para athletes have been described with increasing frequency. This review summarizes musculoskeletal injuries in Para athletes. Seated Para athletes sustain upper extremity injuries more commonly; ambulant Para athletes frequently sustain lower extremity injuries. The upper extremity is the most commonly injured anatomic area in all Para athletes, unlike able-bodied athletes. Advanced age and spinal cord injury may increase the risk of upper extremity injury. Injury data for recreational and youth Para athletes are sparse. Summarizing current injury epidemiology data may help to accelerate the development of injury prevention strategies and lifetime injury models for Para athletes.

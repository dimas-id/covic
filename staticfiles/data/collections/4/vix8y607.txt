We present a comparison between stochastic simulations and mean-field theories for the epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on correlated networks (both assortative and disassortative) with a power-law degree distribution [Formula: see text]. We confirm the vanishing of the threshold regardless of the correlation pattern and the degree exponent [Formula: see text]. Thresholds determined numerically are compared with quenched mean-field (QMF) and pair quenched mean-field (PQMF) theories. Correlations do not change the overall picture: The QMF and PQMF theories provide estimates that are asymptotically correct for large sizes for [Formula: see text] , while they only capture the vanishing of the threshold for [Formula: see text] , failing to reproduce quantitatively how this occurs. For a given size, PQMF theory is more accurate. We relate the variations in the accuracy of QMF and PQMF predictions with changes in the spectral properties (spectral gap and localization) of standard and modified adjacency matrices, which rule the epidemic prevalence near the transition point, depending on the theoretical framework. We also show that, for [Formula: see text] , while QMF theory provides an estimate of the epidemic threshold that is asymptotically exact, it fails to reproduce the singularity of the prevalence around the transition.

The positive strand RNA coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), induces a G2/M phase arrest and reduction in the G1 and G1/S phase transition regulator cyclin D1. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was reduced post-transcriptionally within infected cells independently of the cell-cycle stage at the time of infection. Confocal microscopy revealed that cyclin D1 decreased in IBV-infected cells as infection progressed and inhibition studies indicated that a population of cyclin D1 could be targeted for degradation by a virus mediated pathway. In contrast to the SARS-coronavirus, IBV nucleocapsid protein did not interact with cyclin D1.

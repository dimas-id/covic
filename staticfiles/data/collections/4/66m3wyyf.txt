Coronaviruses infect many species of animals, including humans. Among them, murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) has been well studied as a model of human diseases, such as hepatitis and demyelinating disease. An agent causing severe acute respiratory disease (SARS), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is a newcomer in this genus, however, it is now one of the most studied coronaviruses due to its medical impact. The receptors of those two viruses have been identified and their cell entry mechanism has been actively investigated. Recently, SARS-CoV cell entry mechanism is shown to be different from that of other enveloped viruses, including MHV. In this review, cell entry mechanism of those two viruses is described, stressing on the difference and similarity found between those two viruses.

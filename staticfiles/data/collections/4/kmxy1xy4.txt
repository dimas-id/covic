The treatment of wide-neck bifurcation cerebral aneurysms is challenging especially if at least one of the arteries arise from an obtuse angle. These wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms are difficult to treat with the usual balloon and stent assisted coiling, including Y stenting or double-barrel stent techniques [1, 2]. Other available options include using current devices with the waffle cone or double waffle cone techniques [3, 4]. Novel devices that are in development include intrasaccular devices and the barrel bifurcation vascular reconstruction device (Covidien) [5, 6, 7]. We report the use of a novel barrel technique using the LVIS (low-profile visualized intraluminal support) Jr stent for the treatment of a wide-neck bifurcation aneurysm.

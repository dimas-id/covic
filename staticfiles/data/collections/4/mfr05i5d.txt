There is growing evidence that ethnic minorities in Europe are disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Using a name-based ethnicity classifier, we found that hospitalised Black, Asian and minority ethnic cases were younger and more likely to be admitted to intensive care (ICU). Pakistani, Bangladeshi and White - other than British or Irish, ethnic groups were most at risk. In this study, older age and male gender, but not ethnicity, were associated with death in hospitalised patients.

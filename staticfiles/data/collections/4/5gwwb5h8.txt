Hepatic sclerosing hemangioma is a rare benign disease that occurs in association with hepatic cavernous hemangioma degeneration and sclerosis. Recent studies have shown that radiofrequency (RF) ablation is an alternative treatment for hepatic cavernous hemangiomas, even for large hemangiomas (â‰¥10 cm). However, RF ablation might not be suitable to treat large sclerosing hemangiomas. We herein report the successful surgical removal of a large hepatic sclerosing hemangioma after RF ablation treatment failure in a 65-year-old man. In conclusion, we suggest that resection should be chosen as a first-line therapy for the disease.

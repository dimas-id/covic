Upon return from Hajj 2014, 150 Australian pilgrims were interviewed about their understanding of the Ebola epidemic. Most (89%, 134/150) knew of the epidemic before travelling and 60% (80/134) of those knew Ebola transmits through body fluids. Pilgrims who received pre-travel health advice were more conscious of Ebola (69% vs 31%, p = 0.01) and adhered better to hand hygiene after touching an ill person (68% vs 31%, p < 0.01). Mass media was the main information source (78%).

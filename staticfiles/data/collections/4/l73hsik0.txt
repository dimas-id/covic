Phage display involves the expression of selected proteins on the surface of filamentous phage through fusion with phage coat protein, with the genetic sequence packaged within, linking phenotype to genotype selection. When combined with antibody libraries, phage display allows for rapid in vitro selection of antigen-specific antibodies and recovery of their corresponding coding sequence. Large non-immune and synthetic human libraries have been constructed as well as smaller immune libraries based on capturing a single individualâ€™s immune repertoire. This completely in vitro process allows for isolation of antibodies against poorly immunogenic targets as well as those that cannot be obtained by animal immunization, thus further expanding the utility of the approach. Phage antibody display represents the first developed methodology for high throughput screening for human therapeutic antibody candidates. Recently, other methods have been developed for generation of fully human therapeutic antibodies, such as single B-cell screening, next-generation genome sequencing and transgenic mice with human germline B-cell genes. While each of these have their particular advantages, phage display has remained a key methodology for human antibody discovery due its in vitro process. Here, we review the continuing role of this technique alongside other developing technologies for therapeutic antibody discovery.

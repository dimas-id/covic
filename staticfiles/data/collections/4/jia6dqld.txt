Microarrays can be constructed with dozens to millions of probes on their surface to allow high-throughput analyses of many biologic processes to be performed simultaneously on the same sample. Microarrays are now widely used for gene expression analysis, deoxyribonucleic acid resequencing, single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, and comparative genomic hybridization. Microarray technology is accelerating research in many fields and now microarrays are moving into clinical application. This review discusses the emerging role of microarrays in molecular diagnostics, pathogen detection, oncology, and pharmacogenomics.

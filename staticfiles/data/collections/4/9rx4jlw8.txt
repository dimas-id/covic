Based on the general framework of logical analysis of data, we develop a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes for genotyping applications in this paper. When extensively tested on genomic sequences downloaded from the Lost Alamos National Laboratory and the National Center of Biotechnology Information websites in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experimental settings, the proposed probe design method selected a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences. These results well illustrate the utility of the proposed method in genotyping applications.

Feline calicivirus (FCV) strains isolated from feces (E-FCV) were compared with FCV strains of respiratory origin (R-FCV). All strains were shown to be labile at pH 3.0. All strains except one strain of E-FCV were found to be sensitive to the action of trypsin. When exposed to bile salt (deoxycholic acid sodium salt), all R-FCV strains were markedly inactivated, but none of the E-FCV strains was inactivated. It was possible to select bile-resistant substrains from a bile-sensitive strain.

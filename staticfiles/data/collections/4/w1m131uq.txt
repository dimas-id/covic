Acquired causes of coronary fistulas are rare disorders and may develop following coronary atherosclerosis, infection, or trauma (iatrogenic). Iatrogenic coronary fistulas may be acquired secondary to surgical or nonsurgical interventions. We describe a case of an iatrogenic coronary artery-left ventricle fistula following mitral valve replacement surgery, presented with ventricular arrhythmia and heart failure. In a unique technique, we implanted three coils with the aid of a Scepter C balloon with inflation at the ostial portion of the left circumflex artery.

Eight new fasamycin-type polyketides, streptovertimycins A–H (1−8), were isolated from soil-derived Streptomyces morookaense SC1169 cultivated on wheat grains. Their structures were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis and theoretical computations of ECD spectra. Compounds 1−8 have a fasamycin-type pentacyclic structure featuring a 15-O-methyl group. They exhibited potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) with MIC values in the range of 0.63–5.0 μg/ml. The activity profile provided new insights into the structure–activity relationships of fasamycin-type antibiotics.

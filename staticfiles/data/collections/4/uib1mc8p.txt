This article identifies payment policy perspectives of the American Academy of Neurology's guideline on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The guideline is a reliable repository of information for advocating or not recommending certain CAM treatments in MS. It eases the burden of searching for information on each separate CAM treatment. It frequently emphasizes the need for patient counseling. To provide such generally undervalued, but needed, cognitive services, neurologists could use advanced practice providers and patient-friendly visual aids during or between visits. They should also rely on evaluation and management codes that recognize time spent predominantly on counseling or coordination of care. The guideline's categorization of probable effectiveness of certain therapies will not influence coverage decisions because payers do not generally cover CAM therapies.

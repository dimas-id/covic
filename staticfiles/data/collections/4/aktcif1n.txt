Beauveria bassiana has been extensively employed since the last century for biocontrol of lepidopteran pests. B. bassiana has also been explored for diverse functions including bioremediation of toxic industrial effluents and heavy-metal polluted soils. Investigations on multifarious applications of chemically diverse secondary metabolites of this entomopathogenic fungus offer promising implications in pharmaceutical and agricultural sectors. In addition, the development of eco-friendly bioremediation strategies using abiotic stress-tolerant strains of B. bassiana will contribute to maintain the sustainability of agroecosystem.

This chapter starts from a holistic perspective on health in the society. It makes a statement that, in order to become effective and sustainable, health communication needs to be studied, assessed, and practiced from a rights- or social justice-based position. Such an approach implies the use and integration of multidisciplinary perspectives that try to grasp the complexity of health issues from both global and local, individual, interpersonal, group, and community levels.

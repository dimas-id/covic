This review evaluates studies published between January 1997 and August 2003 comparing clinical outcome and bacteriological eradication rates for patients with acute streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis treated with penicillin or other antimicrobial agents. Studies were identified using MEDLINE, and clinical outcome and bacteriological eradication at end of treatment and 2 weeks after end of treatment were ascertained. Any longer-term follow-up was also noted, along with treatment-related adverse events and compliance. Clinical efficacy rates between penicillin and comparator antibiotics were generally high and similar. Bacterial eradication rates were more variable and, 2 weeks after treatment, ranged from 64% to 93% for penicillin and 31% to 98% for comparators. Simpler dosing schedules and shorter therapy durations produced higher compliance rates. This review highlights the similarities and differences between treatment with penicillin and a wide range of comparator antibiotics. Therapy for acute group A streptococcal pharyngitis should combine excellent clinical efficacy, high bacteriological eradication rates, good tolerance and a simple, convenient dosing regimen.

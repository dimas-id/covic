Vesicovaginal fistulas (VVF) represent a detrimental condition causing psychological, physical and social strain on patients. In developed countries they are predominantly the result of pelvic surgery or radiation therapy, whilst obstetric VVF are common in developing countries due to prolonged and complicated births. The majority of VVF require surgical therapy, thus a comprehensive diagnostic workup is needed. Depending on diagnostic characteristics fistula repair can be performed by a transvaginal, transabdominal or minimally invasive approach. Timing of surgery, appropriate interposition of vascularized grafts, optimized postoperative management and surgical expertise are determining factors for successful treatment. This review describes the diagnostic workup and therapeutic management of VVF including various surgical techniques.

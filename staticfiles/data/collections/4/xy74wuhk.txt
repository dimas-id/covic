Uni- or bilateral radial nerve palsy in newborn is a rare symptom. We report about a case of unusual bilateral radial nerve palsy in a term-born girl who recovered completely after 10 months and review the English-speaking literature about this condition. Review of the literature shows less than 60 reported cases of radial nerve palsy, most of them unilateral. Conclusion: Besides the clinical examination, in most cases, no further diagnostic investigation is necessary. An incomplete restitution is rare as recovery mostly occurs within 3â€“6 months.

Since 2015 most patients implanted with cardiac devices (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), Implantable Loop Recorders (ILRs), Pacemakers (PMs)) at Santa Croce e Carle Hospital (Cuneo, Italy) are remotely followed with home monitoring systems free of charge. From 2017 the home monitoring outpatient follow‚Äêup service has been systematically organized mainly for the peculiar geographical features (typically mountainous, vast and with few roads) of the territory served by our hospital, making difficult for patients the access to the health care facilities.

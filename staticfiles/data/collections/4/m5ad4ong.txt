COVID-19 and related efforts to mitigate its spread have dramatically transformed the structure and predictability of modern childhood, resulting in growing concerns children may be particularly vulnerable to serious mental health consequences. Worldwide stay-at-home directives and emergency changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement have smoothed the trail for broad implementation of technology-based remote mental health services for children. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is particularly well-positioned to address some of the most pressing child and parental needs that arise during stressful times, and telehealth formats of PCIT, such as Internet-delivered PCIT (iPCIT), have already been supported in controlled trials. This commentary explores PCIT implementation during the COVID-19 public health crisis and the challenges encountered in the move toward Internet-delivered services.

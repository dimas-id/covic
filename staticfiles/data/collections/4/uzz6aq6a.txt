BACKGROUND The 12-month (M) PROTECT study showed that de novo liver transplant recipients (LTxR) who switched from a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppression to a CNI-free everolimus (EVR)-based regimen showed numerically better renal function. Here, we present the five-yr follow-up data. METHODS PROTECT was a randomized controlled study in which LTxR received basiliximab and CNI-based immunosuppression Â± corticosteroids. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive EVR or continue CNI. Patients completing the core study could enter the extension study on their randomized treatment. RESULTS A total of 81 patients entered the extension study (41, EVR; 40, CNI). At M59 post-randomization, the adjusted mean eGFR was significantly higher in the EVR group, with a benefit of 12.4 mL/min using Cockcroft-Gault (95% CI: 1.2; 23.6; p = 0.0301). Also, there was a significant benefit for adjusted and unadjusted eGFR using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD4) or Nankivell formula. During the extension period, treatment failure rates were similar. SAEs occurred in 26 (63.4%) and 28 (70.0%) of the patients in EVR and CNI groups, respectively. CONCLUSION Compared with the CNI-based treatment, EVR-based CNI-free immunosuppression resulted in significantly better renal function and comparable patient and graft outcomes after five-yr follow-up.

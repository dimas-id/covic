Abstract Death certification requires the same effort and dedication as all reports by doctors during their patients’ lifetimes. The physician must follow the basic instructions to complete a death certificate correctly, taking special care to fill in the sequence of causes of death. In the case of a pandemic, completion of the death certificate falls to the primary care physician and therefore the official bodies must publish instructions based on international recommendations. It should be established as soon as possible whether it is possible to report deaths telematically. While this is not possible, in a pandemic procedures should be put in place to enable the immediate reporting of deaths to the health authorities.

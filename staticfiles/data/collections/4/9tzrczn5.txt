Abstract We describe the use of epidural analgesia in a 39-year-old G2P1 parturient presenting at 38+6 weeks estimated gestation with confirmed influenza A H1N1 and superimposed bilateral pneumonia. Although the patient had an uncomplicated intra- and post-partum course, little is known about the safety of performing neuraxial analgesia or anesthesia in patients with influenza. The prevalence of viremia and possible translocation of blood-borne virus to the central nervous system are discussed.

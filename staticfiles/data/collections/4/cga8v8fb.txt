Based on the statistical analyses of the data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and meteorological determinants in some of the severely affected cities in Spain, Italy and the USA, some models are constructed showing the relationship of I' (the number of infected individuals divided by the total population of a city) with temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and time. Three models are based on the data before lockdown/travel restrictions in these cities, and the other three models are based on data both before and after lockdown/travel restrictions. These models, in general, indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 could be relatively high either for elevated temperatures with lower relative humidity or for lower temperatures with higher relative humidity conditions. Although one model indicates exponential increase in number of infection cases with time, the more statistically significant models show that the number of cases varies quadratically with time. We have discussed in short, how all these features could be linked with the alterations of structural characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, the possibility of natutal disappearance of COVID-19 pandemic, at the global level, has been discussed in the context of the most statistically significant model.

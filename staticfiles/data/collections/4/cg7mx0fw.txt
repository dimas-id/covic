BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher among people with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are used in the majority of people with DM and CVD. This mini-review discusses the current understanding of benefit-risk ratio of use of statins in COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till June 12, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Statins, with their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant properties, have the potential to reduce severity of lung injury in, and mortality from, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections. Statin-induced upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has the potential to reduce lung injury from excess angiotensin II. By disrupting lipid rafts, statins have the potential to reduce viral entry into cells. However, benefit-risk ratio of its complex interaction with MYD88 gene expression on outcomes in COVID-19, and the putative role of low serum LDL cholesterol in increasing severity of SARS-CoV2 infection need further clarification. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19, who are already on statins for an underlying co-morbid condition, should continue on it unless there are specific contraindications. De-novo use of statins in people with COVID-19 with no underlying co-morbidity might be beneficial but awaits substantiation in clinical trials; till that time, de novo use of statins in COVID 19 should be limited to a clinical trial setting.

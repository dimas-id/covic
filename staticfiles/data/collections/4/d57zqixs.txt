In this letter the authors discuss the relationship between structure and random walk dynamics in directed complex networks, with an emphasis on identifying whether a topological hub is also a dynamical hub. They establish the necessary conditions for networks to be topologically and dynamically fully correlated (e.g., word adjacency and airport networks), and show that in this case Zipfâ€™s law is a consequence of the match between structure and dynamics. They also show that real-world neuronal networks and the world wide web are not fully correlated, implying that their more intensely connected nodes are not necessarily highly active.

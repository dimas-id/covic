BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus 19 infection (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and Turkey had the first coronavirus patient tested positive in 10 March 2020. AIMS: In this analysis we have discussed the characteristics of Turkish patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Cross sectional study Methods: This retrospective study included all the patients who have been hospitalized for novel coronavirus at blinded for peer review -Department of Internal Medicine between 15th March 2020 and 28th March 2020. Patients were screened with real time PCR (2019nCoV), chest X-ray and computer tomography. Also, their demographic characteristics including sex, age, occupation, comorbid disease etc. were recorded. RESULTS: There were 70 patients for analysis. Thirty-seven patients (52.9 %) tested positive for coronavirus infection with PCR. Mean age was 55.8 (min 24- max 87). There were 49 men (70.0%). Two patients (2%) were sent home and eleven patients (15.7%) were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU). Patients in ICU had statistically higher, pulse rate, respiratory rate, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, c-reactive protein, d-dimer, fibrinogen, activated partial thromboplastin time, troponin and procalcitonin compared to patients followed in clinics. CONCLUSION: Turkey has avoided the disease for some time but as inevitable as it is, our country has been added to the countries which are infected.

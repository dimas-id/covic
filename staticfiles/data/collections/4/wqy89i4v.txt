The gag and pol genes of most retroviruses occur in different reading frames and their translation as a single polypeptide is carried out by ribosomal frameshifting in the âˆ’1 direction. The alignment of the different reading frames occurs by overlapping reading in response to at least two signals within the RNA: one is a heptanucleotide stretch at the frameshift site and the other is a stem-loop structure which occurs just downstream of the first signal.

Background: In March 2020, it was necessary to impose so-called curfews for several weeks across Germany due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant massive restraints for the population. Objectives: It was to be investigated whether the theory of reasoned action (TORA) is an adequate method for explaining the intention to follow the curfews and to explain whether anticipation of sanctions influences the intention. There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? Methods: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individual’s intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1–7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. Results: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p &lt; 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (∆R 2 = 0.002). Discussion: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews. Key political decision-makers should avoid threatening sanctions during speeches to increase compliance but instead emphasize the meaning and benefit of the measures for society and also for the individual’s own social environment in order to positively influence the intended goals.

In this study we argue that parasite-host infections are a major research topic because of their implications for human health, agriculture and wildlife. The evolution of infection mechanisms is a research topic in areas such as virology and ecology. Mathematical modelling has been an essential tool to obtain a better systematic and quantitative understanding of the processes of parasitic infection that are difficult to discern through strictly experimental approaches. In this article we review recent attempts using mathematical models to discriminate and quantify these infection mechanisms. We also emphasize the challenges that these models could bring to new fields of study such as social sciences and economics.

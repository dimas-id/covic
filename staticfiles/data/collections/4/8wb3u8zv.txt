BACKGROUND To determine, in a private practice, whether symptomatic bile reflux can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) for morbid obesity and the outcome after laparoscopic alimentary (Roux) limb lengthening. Bile reflux as a cause of pain after laparoscopic RYGB has not been previously described. We report on a series of patients with chronic pain after RYGB as a result of bile reflux owing an abnormally short alimentary limb. METHODS A prospective database of patients who underwent revisional surgery to treat symptomatic bile reflux at our center was retrospectively reviewed and analyzed for the onset of symptoms, interval to revision, length of alimentary limb, and outcome after revision. RESULTS A total of 16 patients were diagnosed with bile reflux and underwent revisional surgery. The onset of symptoms occurred at 58.3 +/- 22.2 months after RYGB. All patients complained of pain, 13 (81.3%) had vomiting, and 7 (43.8%) had dysphagia. Endoscopy was performed in all patients and confirmed the presence of bile in all patients and detected marginal ulceration in 5 (31.3%) and gastritis in 8 (50.0%). At revisional surgery, the mean alimentary limb length was 37.7 +/- 12.4 cm (range 20-62 cm). At a mean follow-up of 14.9 months after revision, all patients had reported resolution of their symptoms. CONCLUSION Although previously unreported after RYGB, bile reflux can be an important possible cause of chronic pain. Bile reflux, however, responds favorably to alimentary limb lengthening to 100 cm and was not been seen in patients with an alimentary limb length >62 cm.

Respect for privacy and confidentiality have been professional responsibilities of physicians throughout recorded history. This article reviews the moral, religious, and legal foundations of privacy and confidentiality and discusses the distinction between these two closely related concepts. Current federal and state laws are reviewed, including HIPAA regulations and their implications for research and care in the emergency department. In the emergency department, privacy and confidentiality often are challenged by physical design, crowding, visitors, film crews, communication, and other factors. These problems are reviewed, and advice and guidelines are offered for helping preserve patients' dignity and rights to privacy and confidentiality.

INTRODUCTION Achieving proficiency in flexible endoscopy is a major priority for general surgery training programs. The Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery (FES™) is a high-stakes examination of the knowledge and skills required to perform flexible endoscopy. The objective of this study was to establish additional evidence for the validity of the FES™ hands-on test as a measure of flexible endoscopy skills by correlating clinical colonoscopy performance with FES™ score. METHODS Participants included FES™-naïve general surgery residents, gastroenterology fellows at all levels of training and attending physicians who regularly perform colonoscopy. Each participant completed a live colonoscopy and the FES™ hands-on test within 2 weeks. Performance on live colonoscopy was measured using the Global Assessment of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Skills-Colonoscopy (GAGES-C, maximum score 20), and performance on the FES™ hands-on test was assessed by the simulator's computerized scoring system. The clinical assessor was blinded to simulator performance. Scores were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS A total of 24 participants were enrolled (mean age 30; 54 % male) with a broad range of endoscopy experience; 17 % reported no experience, 54 % had <25 previous colonoscopies; and 21 % had >100. The FES™ and GAGES scores reflected the broad range of endoscopy experience of the study group (FES™ score range 32-105; GAGES score range 5-20). Pearson's correlation coefficient between GAGES-C scores and FES™ hands-on test scores was 0.78 (0.54-0.90, p < 0.0001). All eight participants with GAGES-C score >15/20 achieved a passing score on the FES™ hands-on test. CONCLUSION There is a strong correlation between clinical colonoscopy performance and scores achieved on the FES™ hands-on test. These data support the validity of FES™ as a measure of colonoscopy skills.

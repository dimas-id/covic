Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome disease (PRRS), a disease that has a significant and economic impact on the swine industry. In this study, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers with high specificity and affinity against VR-2332 strain of PRRSV type II were successfully obtained. Of 19 candidates, the LB32 aptamer was found to be the most specific and sensitive to VR-2332 strain according to an aptamer-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The detection of VR-2332 of PRRSV type II was successfully accomplished using the enzyme-linked antibody-aptamer sandwich (ELAAS) method. The detection limit of ELAAS was 4.8 Ã— 10(0) TCID(50)/mL that is comparable to some of the previous reports of the PCR-based detection but does not require any complicated equipment or extra costs. Moreover, this ELAAS-based PRRSV detection showed similar sensitivity for both the VR-2332 samples spiked in diluted swine serum and in buffer. Therefore, this VR-2332 strain-specific aptamer and its assay method with high specificity can be used as an alternative method for the fast and precise detection of PRRSV.

During 1989 fecal and gut samples of 598 dogs, 189 cats, 496 calves, 100 pigs and 66 foals with diarrhoea were investigated for virus by electron microscopy. In samples of dogs and cats Parvovirus was detected in 18.5% and 8.5% of the samples, respectively; Coronavirus was found in 14.9% and in 16.4% of the specimens. In samples of calves Coronavirus dominated with a detection rate of 37.5%, followed by Rotavirus with 10.7% and not clearly identifiable particles resembling Coronavirus (4.2%). In 7.1% of the specimens Rotavirus as well as Coronavirus was found. In 33% of specimens from piglets Coronavirus was detected. 10.6% of the faeces from foals contained Coronavirus-like particles. Between 1987 and 1989 the detection rate of Parvovirus in faeces from dogs and cats decreased from 24.2% to 18.6% and from 17.5% to 8.5%. Coronaviruses in calves, dogs and cats increased from 22.9% to 37.5%, from 5.6% to 14.9% and from 8.2% to 16.4% of the samples investigated.

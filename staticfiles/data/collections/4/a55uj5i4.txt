The introduction of robotics into surgery represents progression in the field of minimally invasive surgery. Its use has been reported in coronary artery bypass graft along with repair of other major vascular structures. We report the first case of robot-assisted resection of a large hepatic artery aneurysm. Robotic surgery is safe and feasible and is a significant advance in the field of aneurismal repair. It offers significant advantages in the degrees of freedom of movement compared to laparoscopic surgery.

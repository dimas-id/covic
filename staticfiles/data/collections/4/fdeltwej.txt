The majority of the Internet-of-things (IoT)-based health monitoring systems adopt ontologies to represent and interoperate the huge quantity of data collected. Classical ontologies cannot appropriately treat imprecise and ambiguous knowledge. The integration of Fuzzy logic theory with ontology can effectively resolve knowledge problems with uncertainty. It considerably raises the accuracy and the precision of healthcare decisions. This paper presents a fuzzy-ontology based system using the internet of things and aims to ensure continues monitoring of diabetic patients. It mainly describes the ontology-based model and the semantic fuzzy decision-making mechanism. The system is evaluated using semantic querying. The results indicate its feasibility for effective remote continuous monitoring for diabetes.

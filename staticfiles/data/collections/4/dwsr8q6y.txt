OBJECTIVE: The impact of tracheostomy on language and cognitive development in infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is not known. We hypothesize that tracheostomy has an independent negative impact on language and cognitive development in infants with severe BPD. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of de-identified data of infants with severe BPD who received tracheostomy at <2 years of age, compared with infants with severe BPD without tracheostomy. The primary outcomes measured were total language and cognitive scores at 2â€“3 years of age as determined by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients with tracheostomies and 28 patients without tracheostomies were analyzed. There was no significant difference in total language development or cognitive development between patients with tracheostomies and those without. Insurance status had an effect on language and cognition while controlling for trach status. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy does not independently impact the language and cognitive development of infants with severe BPD.

BACKGROUND Experience with the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms by the Flow Re-Direction Endoluminal Device (FRED) is still limited. The aim of this study is to discuss the results and complications of this new flow diverter device (FDD). METHODS Between November 2013 and April 2015, 20 patients (15 female and five male) harboring 24 cerebral aneurysms were treated with FRED FDD in a single center. RESULTS Complete occlusion was obtained in 20/24 aneurysms (83 %) and partial occlusion in four (17 %). Intraprocedural technical complication occurred in one case (4 %) and post-procedural complications in three (12 %). None reported neurological deficits (mRS = 0). All FRED were patent at follow-up. No early or delayed aneurysm rupture, no subarachnoid (SAH) or intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) no ischemic complications and no deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment with FRED FDD is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, resulting in a high rate of occlusion. The FRED is substantially equivalent to the other known FDDs, which show similar functions and technical profiles.

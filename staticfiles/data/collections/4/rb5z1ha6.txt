Cytokine storm is an important cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. Excessive secretion and accumulation of mucins on the surface of airway cause airway obstruction and exacerbate lung infections. MUC5AC and MUC5B are the main secreted mucins and overexpressed in various inflammatory responses. S-allylmercaptocysteine, a water-soluble organic sulfur compound extracted from garlic, has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects for various pulmonary diseases. The aim of this work was to investigate the therapeutic effects of SAMC on mucin overproduction and inflammation in 16HBE cells and LPS-induced ARDS mice. Results show that SAMC treatment ameliorated inflammatory cell infiltration and lung histopathological changes in the LPS-induced ARDS mice. SAMC also inhibited the expressions of MUC5AC and MUC5B, decreased the production of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, CD86 and IL-12) and increased the production of anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10, CD206 and TGF-β). These results confirm that SAMC had potential beneficial effects on suppressed hyperinflammation and mucin overexpression. Furthermore, SAMC exerted the therapeutic effects through the inhibition of phosphorylation of MAPKs and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways in the 16HBE cells and mice. Overall, our results demonstrate the effects of SAMC on the LPS-induced mucin overproduction and inflammation both in the 16HBE cells and mice.

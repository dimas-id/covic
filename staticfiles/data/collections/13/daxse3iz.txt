BACKGROUND This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic greater curve plication (LGCP) for the treatment of obesity in ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong. METHODS Twenty-seven consecutive Chinese patients (23 females; mean age 37.6 ± 8.9 years) received LGCP for the treatment of obesity from September 2010 to December 2011. Mean baseline body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were 84.6 ± 17.5 kg and 31.2 ± 4.7 kg/m(2), respectively. RESULTS All procedures were performed laparoscopically with conversion to open surgery in one patient. There was neither mortality nor any postoperative complications. Mean follow-up was 10.6 ± 6.5 months. Mean procedure time was 117.9 ± 22.3 min and mean hospital stay was 2.6 ± 0.7 days. Mean BMI loss was 4.1 ± 1.6, 4.8 ± 2.0 and 5.2 ± 2.5 kg/m(2) at 3, 6 and 12 months. Mean % EBL was 67.3 ± 42.1, 66.4 ± 35.9 and 60.2 ± 25.5 % at 3, 6 and 12 months. Mean % EBL in BMI >35 group (n = 7) was 38.2 ± 11.1, 43.5 ± 14.0 and 50.6 ± 21.6 % at 3, 6 and 12 months. Mean % EBL in BMI <35 group (n = 20) was 76.5 ± 44.2, 76.5 ± 38.2 and 65.0 ± 27.0 % at 3, 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS LGCP is safe and effective in achieving significant weight loss in obese ethnic Chinese patients. However, weight loss in BMI <35 is more pronounced. It is a very valid alternative to other procedures in Asian population.

COVID-19 is known to cause serious respiratory symptoms and involvement of other body systems such as hematopoietic, neurological and the immune system. In this report, we described a case of a COVID-19 patient who presented with no pulmonary involvement but severe thrombocytopenia. She suffered from headache and malaise with no respiratory symptoms, fever or chills. Chest radiological imaging was unremarkable but, the laboratory results showed significant thrombocytopenia associated with relatively decreased lymphocytes. Based on her high-risk work environment, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab. Complete blood count (CBC) of patient was re-checked during admission and platelet count showed rising trend up to normal levels. A narrow diagnostic approach where only febrile patients with pulmonary symptoms are evaluated for a COVID-19 diagnosis will result in many missed diagnoses; so it is important that physicians are familiar with atypical and rare presentations of COVID-19, such as isolated thrombocytopenia.

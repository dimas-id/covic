We report a case of a 28-year-old major depressive female patient who manifested ecchymoses following fluoxetine use. After substitution of sertraline, her depression resolved after 4 weeks and ecchymoses 1.5 months latter. This is an unexplored side-effect with unknown long-term consequences that warrants further study.

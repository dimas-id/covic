The variations with breed, gender, age and coat colour in the prevalence of Culicoides hypersensitivity were studied in 408 horses on 18 farms in Israel. Data were gathered by means of questionnaires and the diagnoses were confirmed by direct physical examinations. The prevalence of Culicoides hypersensitivity was 28 per cent. The disease was rare on farms more than 800 m above sea level but was more prevalent at lower altitudes. The most important factors affecting the prevalence of Culicoides hypersensitivity were the farm, breed and age, but gender and colour were not significantly correlated with its prevalence.

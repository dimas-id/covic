A stochastic cellular automaton is developed for modeling waves in excitable media. A scale of key features of excitation waves can be reproduced in the presented framework such as the shape, the propagation velocity, the curvature effect and spontaneous appearance of target patterns. Some well-understood phenomena such as waves originating from a point source, double spiral waves and waves around some obstacles of various geometries are simulated. We point out that unlike the deterministic approaches, the present model captures the curvature effect and the presence of target patterns without permanent excitation. Spontaneous appearance of patterns, which have been observed in a new experimental system and a chemical lens effect, which has been reported recently can also be easily reproduced. In all cases, the presented model results in a fast computer simulation.

Abstract As we learn more and more about the classes of organisms that infect humans, we are discovering that many organisms, including pathogenic organisms, may have a complex relationship with humans in which infection seldom results in the production disease. In some cases, infection may be just one biological event that occurs during a multievent process that develops sequentially, over time, and involves genetic and environmental factors that may vary among individuals. Consequently, the role of infectious organisms in the development of human disease may not meet all of the criteria normally required to determine when an organism can be called the cause of a disease. This chapter reviews the expanding role of infections in the development of human disease. We discuss prion diseases of humans, a fascinating example of an infectious disease-causing agent that is not a living organism. We also discuss the diseases of unknown etiology for which infectious organisms may play a role. In addition, this chapter reviews some of the misconceptions and recurring errors associated with the classification of infectious diseases that have led to misdiagnoses and have impeded our understanding of the role of organisms in the development of human diseases.

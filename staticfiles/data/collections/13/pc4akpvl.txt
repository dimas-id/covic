PURPOSE To investigate the feasibility and safety of solo surgery with single-port laparoscopic appendectomy, which is termed herein solo-SPLA (solo-single-port laparoscopic appendectomy). METHODS This study prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed data from patients who had undergone either non-solo-SPLA (n = 150) or solo-SPLA (n = 150). Several devices were utilized for complete, skin-to-skin solo-SPSA, including a Lone Star Retractor System and an adjustable mechanical camera holder. RESULTS Operating times were not significantly different between solo- and non-solo-SPLA (45.0 ± 21.0 minutes vs. 46.7 ± 26.1 minutes, P = 0.646). Most postoperative variables were also comparable between groups, including the necessity for intravenous analgesics (0.7 ± 1.2 ampules [solo-SPLA] vs. 0.9 ± 1.5 ampules [non-solo-SPLA], P = 0.092), time interval to gas passing (1.3 ± 1.0 days vs. 1.4 ± 1.0 days, P = 0.182), and the incidence of postoperative complications (4.0% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.153). Moreover, solo-SPLA effectively lowered the operating cost by reducing surgical personnel expenses. CONCLUSION Solo-SPLA economized staff numbers and thus lowered hospital costs without lengthening of operating time. Therefore, solo-SPLA could be considered a safe and feasible alternative to non-solo-SPLA.

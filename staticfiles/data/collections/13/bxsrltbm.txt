The sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on the whole scientific world. We assisted to a tremendous effort by researchers with the final goal of achieving a better management of COVID-19 patients. The world of otorhinolaryngology, likewise, has not been exempt from this commitment to research. In this commentary we perform a bibliometric review of the available academic literature about COVID-19 in the top 20-ranked ENT journal, with the goal of providing an overview of what has been published to date and encouraging a shift towards quantitative research.

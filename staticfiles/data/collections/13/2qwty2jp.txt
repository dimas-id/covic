BACKGROUND: Since emergence of the new coronavirus in China in December 2019, many countries have been struggling to control skyrocketing numbers of infections, including among healthcare personnel. It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV‑2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in n = 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5 µm was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with the current literature, clearly emphasize that tracheostomy care is associated with a high infection risk and should only be performed by a small group of well-trained, maximally protected healthcare personnel.

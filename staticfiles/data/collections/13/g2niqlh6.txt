Lung disease is common throughout the world. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, fibrosis, etc. Timely diagnosis of lung disease is essential. Many image processing and machine learning models have been developed for this purpose. Different forms of existing deep learning techniques including convolutional neural network (CNN), vanilla neural network, visual geometry group based neural network (VGG), and capsule network are applied for lung disease prediction.The basic CNN has poor performance for rotated, tilted, or other abnormal image orientation. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid deep learning framework by combining VGG, data augmentation and spatial transformer network (STN) with CNN. This new hybrid method is termed here as VGG Data STN with CNN (VDSNet). As implementation tools, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, and Keras are used. The new model is applied to NIH chest X-ray image dataset collected from Kaggle repository. Full and sample versions of the dataset are considered. For both full and sample datasets, VDSNet outperforms existing methods in terms of a number of metrics including precision, recall, F0.5 score and validation accuracy. For the case of full dataset, VDSNet exhibits a validation accuracy of 73%, while vanilla gray, vanilla RGB, hybrid CNN and VGG, and modified capsule network have accuracy values of 67.8%, 69%, 69.5%, 60.5% and 63.8%, respectively. When sample dataset rather than full dataset is used, VDSNet requires much lower training time at the expense of a slightly lower validation accuracy. Hence, the proposed VDSNet framework will simplify the detection of lung disease for experts as well as for doctors.

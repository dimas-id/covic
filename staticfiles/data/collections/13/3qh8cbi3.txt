The human colorectal adenocarcinoma‐derived Caco‐2 cell line was evaluated as a means isolating common respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal aspirates for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. One hundred eighty‐nine direct immunofluorescence positive nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from patients with various viral respiratory diseases were cultured in the presence of Caco‐2 cells or the following conventional cell lines: LLC‐MK2, MDCK, HEp‐2, and A549. Caco‐2 cell cultures effectively propagated the majority (84%) of the viruses present in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples compared with any positive cultures obtained using the panel cells (78%) or individual cell line MDCK (38%), HEp‐2 (21%), LLC‐MK2 (27%), or A549 (37%) cell lines. The differences against individual cell line were statistically significant (P = < 0.000001). Culture in Caco‐2 cells resulted in the isolation of 85% (36/42) of viruses which were not cultivated in conventional cell lines. By contrast, 80% (24/30) of viruses not cultivated in Caco‐2 cells were isolated using the conventional panel. The findings indicated that Caco‐2 cells were sensitive to a wide range of viruses and can be used to culture a broad range of respiratory viruses. J. Med.

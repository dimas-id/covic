OBJECTIVE Current treatments cannot completely eradicate HIV-1 owing to the presence of latently infected cells, which harbor transcriptionally silent HIV-1. However, defucosylated antibodies can readily kill latently infected cells after their activation to express envelope glycoprotein (Env) through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We herein aimed to test a defucosylated bispecific multivalent molecule consisting of domain-antibody and single-domain CD4, LSEVh-LS-F, for its HIV-1 neutralizing activity and ADCC against the reactivated latently infected cells, compared with the nondefucosylated molecule LSEVh-LS. METHODS LSEVh-LS-F's neutralizing activity against a panel of newly characterized Chinese HIV-1 clinical isolates was assessed by using TZM-bl-based and PBMC-based assays. LSEVh-LS-F-mediated ADCC in the presence of natural killer cells against cell lines that stably express Env proteins, HIV-1-infected cells and LRA-reactivated HIV-1 latent cells, was measured using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay or flow cytometry. RESULTS LSEVh-LS-F and LSEVh-LS were equally effective in neutralized infection of all HIV-1 isolates tested with IC50 and IC90 values 3âˆ¼4-fold lower than those of VRC01. LSEVh-LS-F was more effective in natural killer-mediated killing of HIV-1 Env-expressing cell lines, HIV-1-infected cells, latency reactivation agents-reactivated ACH2 cells and reactivated latently infected resting CD4 T cell line as well as resting CD4 T lymphocytes isolated from patients receiving HAART. CONCLUSION LSEVh-LS-F exhibits broad HIV-1 neutralizing activity and enhanced ADCC against HIV-1-infected cells, reactivated latently infected cell lines and primary CD4 T cells, thus being a promising candidate therapeutic for eradicating the HIV-1 reservoir.

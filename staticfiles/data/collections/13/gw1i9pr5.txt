BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is usually diagnosed around the age of 60-70 years. Patients older than 65 years are frequently described as "elderly". Several trials with monotherapy have established treatment regimens that offer therapies with reduced side effects but reduced efficacy. We analysed the outcome of elderly glioblastoma patients treated at our facility. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 62 consecutive patients older than 65 years treated for a primary glioblastoma at our facility from 2009 to 2015. RESULTS Median age was 69.6 years (range 65.1-85.6 years); median OS of the entire cohort was 10.9 months. ECOG, MGMT and extent of resection but not age and the time from surgery to radiotherapy were associated with longer survival. Patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly longer survival (20.5 vs. 7.8 months). Furthermore, salvage therapies were associated with significant improved survival when compared to Best Supportive Care (22.3 vs. 8.8 months). CONCLUSION Also elderly patients are likely to benefit from an aggressive treatment after primary diagnosis of glioblastoma.

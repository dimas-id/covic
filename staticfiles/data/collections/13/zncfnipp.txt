As of March 10, 2020, more than 100,000 novel coronavirus pneumonia cases have been confirmed globally. With the continuous spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in even the world, prevention and treatment of the disease have become urgent tasks. The drugs currently being developed are not adequate to deal with this critical situation. In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research. By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period. At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine. The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.

Carbon and graphene quantum dots are prepared using top-down and bottom-up methods. Sustainable synthesis of quantum dots has several advantages such as the use of low-cost and non-toxic raw materials, simple operations, expeditious reactions, renewable resources and straightforward post-processing steps. These nanomaterials are promising for clinical and biomedical sciences, especially in bioimaging, diagnosis, bioanalytical assays and biosensors. Here we review green methods for the fabrication of quantum dots, and biomedical and biotechnological applications.

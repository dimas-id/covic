COVID-19 patients (n = 34) suffering from ARDS were treated with tocilizumab (TCZ). Outcome was classified in two groups: "Death" and "Recovery". Predictive factors of mortality were studied. Mean age was 75.3, mean oxygen (O2) requirements 10.4 l/min. At baseline, all patients had multiple biological abnormalities (lymphopenia, increased CRP, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer and liver enzymes). 24 patients (70.5%) recovered after TCZ therapy and 10 died (29.5%). Deceased subjects differed from patients in whom treatment was effective with regard to more pronounced lymphopenia (0.6 vs 1.0 G/l; p = 0.037), lower platelet number (156 vs 314 G/l; p = 0.0001), lower fibrinogen serum level (0.6 vs 1.0 G/l; p = 0.03), higher aspartate-amino-transferase (108 vs 57 UI/l; p = 0.05) and greater O2 requirements (11 vs 8 l/min; p = 0.003).

Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) is a promising method of producing non-thermal plasma, which is widely used in variety of industrial and biological applications including disinfection/sterilization. Plasma sterilization offers a faster, less toxic and versatile alternative to conventional sterilization techniques. 45 kV, 50 kHz high voltage high-frequency power supply was designed for generating DBD plasma. Experimental studies were conducted using DBD plasma on growth control in algae, breakdown of complex phenols for chemical wastewater treatment and generation of UV, ozone and other reactive species using DBD plasma discharges in ambient air. A portable DBD plasma-based sterilization system is developed for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Quartz tube is used as a dielectric medium between copper foilâ€”SS electrodes and 17 kV, 30 kHz pulse is applied across it, which produces intense DBD across SS mesh. This system can sterilize and disinfect the microorganism contaminated surfaces, garments and used disposable protective gears with UV, ozone and short-lived molecules of metastable states and excited chemical species of nitrogen and oxygen produced during the DBD plasma discharges in ambient air.

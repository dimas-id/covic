INTRODUCTION Single-port or single-incision cholecystectomy with current rigid laparoscopic devices is limited by in-line visualization, restricting the ability to approach the surgical site with proper angles and instrumentation. A single-port access system with articulating arms and strong instrumentation should minimize these issues. The TransEnterix system may facilitate safe and straightforward single-port surgery. METHODS The TransEnterix single-port surgery system was used in both survival and nonsurvival porcine laparoscopic cholecystectomies under animal use committee approval. Nonsurvival procedures compared four standard laparoscopic with four single-port cholecystectomies from a histologic perspective. Five single-port swine laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures were completed in sterile conditions, and all animals survived for 1 week postoperatively. Standard surgical clips were used for both cystic duct and artery ligation. At sacrifice, both gross and microscopic histology were obtained for assessment of surgical complications. RESULTS All cholecystectomies were successfully completed with the TransEnterix single-port system. Operative time for the survival procedures averaged 39.4 (range 18-66) min. Histology of the acute specimens showed less inflammation at the single-port site compared with the trocar sites from the standard cholecystectomy. At sacrifice, no complications were identified. CONCLUSIONS The TransEnterix system is safe and straightforward for completing single-port cholecystectomy in this limited porcine series. Port site inflammation is reduced compared with standard laparoscopic trocars.

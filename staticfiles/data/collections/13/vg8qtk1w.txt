As we have seen in the last chapter, infectious and parasitic diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Approximately 26% of global deaths and 26% of global burden of disease were attributed to infectious diseases in 2001 (Lopez et al.2006 see Chapter 1). One in two deaths that are mostly preventable occurs in developing countries (Kim-Farley 2004 Folch et al.2003. Looking to the remaining 21st century, we could imagine a decline in major infectious diseases like malaria and AIDS as a result of an adoption of effective prevention strategies and treatments or, like in the case of hepatitis B, as a consequence of worldwide vaccination programs in children. In addition, new vaccines, new treatment technologies, as well as an improvement in infrastructures can contribute to win the “battle against infectious diseases.”

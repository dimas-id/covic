Since the first report of cutaneous manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) by Recalcati et al(1), there has been described five clinical patterns including pseudo‐chilblain lesions, vesicular eruptions, urticarial lesions, livedo and necrosis and maculopapular eruptions(2). Several clinical reports have been published recently describing these clinical patterns although there is still a lack of information regarding histopathology of maculopapular eruptions. We designed a retrospective study of patients attended in our department over the course of three weeks. We collected clinical data and pictures, and performed a biopsy when possible.

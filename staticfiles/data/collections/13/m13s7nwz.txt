STUDY OBJECTIVE To demonstrate a new technique of contained in bag morcellation of a myoma after laparoscopic myomectomy. DESIGN Step-by-step explanation of the technique in a narrated video. INTERVENTION Contained In Bag Morcellation of myoma after laparoscopic myomectomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Recent controversy regarding the risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcomatous tissue during morcellation means we need to revise our current approach to tissue extraction at laparoscopic myomectomy and morcellation in general. Herein we present a novel technique, conceived by Dr. Danny Chou, called the Sydney Contained In Bag Morcellation technique for laparoscopic myomectomy. In this technique an EndoCatch bag (EndoCatch II Auto Suture Specimen Retrieval Pouch; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) is introduced in the typical fashion, the myoma is retrieved, and the mouth of the bag is exteriorized onto the abdominal wall. A 12-mm trocar is then introduced within the bag, and pneumoperitoneum is created before introducing an optical balloon tip port (KII Balloon Blunt Tip System; Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) and the power morcellator device. Morcellation is then performed within the bag, under direct vision. This technique may offer a safer approach to morcellation because the bowel is not within the morcellation field and there is lower risk of disseminating occult leiomyosarcomatous tissue during morcellation. Subsequent to the morcellation process, suctioning of the bag removes any aerosolized particles of myoma, further minimizing the risk of possible dissemination. CONCLUSION This technique may enable a minimally invasive approach to myomectomy to continue as a viable option in the era since the warning by the US Food and Drug Administration.

In view of the rising prevalence of dengue virus and mixing of host and vector populations, complete full-length sequence determination of dengue strains isolated from different epidemic areas is important for the study of virus evolution, pathogenicity, vaccine efficiency and diagnosis. Based on the genomic analysis of 51 complete dengue virus sequences, all of which cocirculated in Thailand between 1974 and 2001, we report here the occurrence of homologous recombination in the NS5 nonstructural gene region of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) strains. In order to analyze those 51 virus sequences at one time, we chose to use a highly sensitive recombination detection program called RDP. When RDP detects a possible recombination event, further bootscanning and phylogenetic tree analyses are applied to these candidate sequences to identify this recombination event. We found that within the DENV-2 subfamily, the strain ThNH63/93 is the evolutionary product of a recombination event between ThNH62/93 and ThD2_0284_90 strains. The strain ThNH62/93 was identified as the major parent, while the strain ThD2_0284_90 was the minor parent. The recombination site was determined to localize between positions 7967 (± 36 nt) and 8283 (± 36 nt) with a significance level of p < 0.001. Our results showed, for the first time, that an intraserotype recombination event occurred between DENV-2 strains in the nonstructural gene region; by contrast, an interserotype recombination between different serotypes of dengue strains was not identified. This study thus supports the theory that homologous recombination plays a key role in dengue virus evolution.

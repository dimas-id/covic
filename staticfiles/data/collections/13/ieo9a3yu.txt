The palm (Elaeis guineensis), known as dendê, is an important oleaginous Brazilian plant with a high performance of oil production. In this work, a 23 full experimental design was performed and the response surface method (RSM) was used to indicate the optimum parameter of caffeine adsorption on Elaeis guineensis endocarp activated carbon, since the endocarp is the main by-product from dendê oil production. It was set the adsorbent point of zero charge (pHpzc), and the material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The RSM results indicate removal efficiency (%) at the optimal conditions, 0.20 g of adsorbent, and caffeine initial concentration of 20 mg/L, and acidic medium was about 95%. Based on ANOVA and F test (Fcalculated > Fstandard), the mathematical/statistical model obtained fits well to the experimental data. The overall kinetic studies showed time was achieved after 5 h and caffeine adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemisorption is a predominant mechanism. Redlich-Peterson and Sips models best represented the experimental data (0.967 < R2 < 0.993). Thermodynamic revealed that caffeine adsorption was spontaneous at all temperatures studied, exothermic, and probably with changes in the adsorbate-adsorbent complex during the process. The tests conducted in different water matrixes corroborate the suitability of this adsorbent to be used in caffeine removal even in a complex solution.

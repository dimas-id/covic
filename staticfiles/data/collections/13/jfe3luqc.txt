BACKGROUND A proportion of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. AIM OF THE STUDY To determine the findings on high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) and 24-h pH recording in patients with typical GERD symptoms, refractory to PPI treatment. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of patients referred for HREM and 24-h pH recording was done. We selected patients who were referred for evaluation of refractory GERD symptoms despite > 8 weeks of at least once-daily PPI treatment. Details noted were demographic profile, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy report, HREM findings and 24-h pH findings. RESULTS Ninety-six patients had symptoms of GERD that were refractory to PPI therapy. Seven patients (7.1%) were diagnosed having diseases mimicking GERD: eosinophilic esophagitis (n=2), supragastric belching (n=4) and rumination (n=1). After excluding these patients and those with insufficient data, the final study cohort included 82 cases. Fifty patients (61%) had normal motility. Major motility disorders were detected in 8 (9.75%) patients: achalasia cardia (6) and distal esophageal spasm (2). Ineffective esophageal motility was noted in 24 patients. A total of 74 patients underwent 24-h pH testing. Significant acid reflux with good symptom correlation was noted in 56 patients. Eighteen patients did not have significant acid reflux (Johnson-DeMeester score < 14.7): hypersensitive esophagus (12) and functional heartburn (6). CONCLUSION Fifty-six patients (68.3%) had definite diagnosis of GERD and 31.7% (26) had non-GERD conditions like motility disorders, functional heartburn and hypersensitive esophagus.

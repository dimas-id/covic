In the wake of the tremendous fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic that was mostly negative, I find great optimism and encouragement from the ability of society at all levels to focus on a common problem with a collaborative and productive resolve to address this millennial event. The rapid response was made possible by marshaling the resources available from many sources, not the least of which was the medical association community. It has been particularly gratifying to work hand-in-hand with our specialty societies within and outside the otolaryngology family to produce educational and scientific information that is consistent and that has and will continue to affect policy favorably. The groups that enable these inspirational collaborative accomplishments through their dedication, innovation, and imagination are the practicing physicians who have given freely and generously of their time and talents to help the whole health care community provide the most up-to-date care possible.

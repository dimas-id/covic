The authors present 2 cases of dengue shock syndrome with unusual complications. In the first case, a 14-y-old boy with dengue shock syndrome who required aggressive fluid resuscitation, developed abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Patient developed severe shock, increased ventilator requirement and oliguria as a consequence of ACS. Patient responded well to abdominal paracentesis draining 2.7 l of fluid and made rapid recovery. In the second case, 8-y-old girl was treated for dengue shock syndrome, including mechanical ventilation for ARDS. In the second wk of illness, she developed severe neurological manifestations including frequent episodes of convulsions, hallucinations and altered sensorium. She was diagnosed to have acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis from CT brain findings. She responded well to pulse steroid therapy with complete neurological recovery.

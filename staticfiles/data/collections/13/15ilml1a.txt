Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur during the treatment of several diseases and in several interventional procedures as a complication. It is a difficult situation to handle and special care should be applied to the patients. Mechanical ventilation is used for these patients and several parameters are changed constantly until compliance is achieved. However, a complication that is observed during the application of positive airway pressure is pneumothorax. In our current work we will present definition and causes of pneumothorax in the setting of intensive care unit (ICU). We will identify differences and similarities of this situation and present treatment options.

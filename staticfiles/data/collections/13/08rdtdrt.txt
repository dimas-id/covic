Gene transfer involves the introduction of an engineered gene into a person's cells with the expectation that the protein expressed from the gene will produce a therapeutic benefit. Strategies based on this principle have led to the approval of > 600 clinical trials and enrollment of approximately 3500 subjects worldwide in attempts to treat diseases ranging from cancer to AIDS to cystic fibrosis. While gene therapy has met with limited success and still has many hurdles to overcome before it sees wide application, it may be useful as a defensive strategy against bioterrorism agents including infectious microbes and toxins. Although many defensive strategies are possible, immunological strategies are currently the most developed and are being actively applied to the development of strategies against several of the most virulent potential bio-weapons. While most of these strategies are not yet ready for human application, DNA-based vaccines appear to be among the most promising in the fight against bioterrorism.

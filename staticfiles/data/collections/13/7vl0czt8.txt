OBJECTIVES To report robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) outcomes from a single tertiary hospital in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of patients undergoing RPN at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between January 2008 and January 2018. The study reports patient's demographics, tumor characteristics, operative details, and perioperative outcomes, using descriptive statistics of median and range values. Results: One hundred and one patients underwent RPN during the study period. Average tumor size was 3 (1.3-6.4) cm and average radius exophytic nearness anterior/posterior location (RENAL) score was 6 (4-10). Perioperative parameters were blood loss 200 (5-1500) ml and warm ischemia time 17 (8-40) minutes, excluding off-clamp surgery in 12 (11.9%); operative time was 166 (66-381) minutes. Conversion to open partial nephrectomy occurred in 9 (8.9%) patients, major complications in 3 (3%) patients, positive surgical margins in 5 (5%) patients, and the hospital stay was 4 (2-14) days. A total of 73 (73%) patients achieved a trifecta of freedom from any complication, negative surgical margins, and ischemia time â‰¤25 minutes. Study limitations included the retrospective design and small cohort size. Conclusions: The initial experience of robotic partial nephrectomy was associated with a surgical outcome comparable to that reported by higher-volume centers.

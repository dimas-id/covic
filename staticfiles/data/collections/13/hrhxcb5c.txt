The corona virus pandemic has ignited a proliferation of research aimed at prevention of spread, early diagnosis and treatment. Coincidentally, in recent years the Yorkshire Laser Centre has been engaged in developing the methodology of applying PDT in chronic bronchiectasis. Our methodology is based on Methylene Blue (MB) mediated PDT used topically within the airway.

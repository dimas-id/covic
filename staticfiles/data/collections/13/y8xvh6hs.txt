The sequence of the region located between the S and M glycoprotein genes of the 79-1146 strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is presented. The inter-structural gene region encodes 3 open reading frames (ORFs), termed ORFs 3a, 3b and 4, with nucleotide sequences conforming to the minimum conserved transcription signal upstream of each. An additional ORF, 3x, partially overlaps the 3â€² end of ORF 3a. The FIPV interstructural gene region is identical in length when compared to the Insavc-1 strain of canine coronavirus (CCV) but differs from various strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by the presence of deletions and insertions. The sizes of ORF 3a and 4 are conserved in FIPV, TGEV and CCV. However, as with CCV, the FIPV ORF 3b is truncated in comparison with TGEV.

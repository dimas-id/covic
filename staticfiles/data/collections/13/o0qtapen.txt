RATIONALE Endogenous tissue mediators inducing lung inflammation in the context of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are ill-defined. OBJECTIVES To test whether mitochondrial alarmins are released during VILI, and are associated with lung inflammation. METHODS Release of mitochondrial DNA, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) peptide-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis were measured in conditioned supernatants from human alveolar type II-like (A549) epithelial cells submitted to cyclic stretch in vitro. Similar measurements were performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from rabbits submitted to an injurious ventilatory regimen, and from patients with ARDS. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mitochondrial DNA was released by A549 cells during cell stretching, and was found elevated in BAL fluids from rabbits during VILI, and from ARDS patients. Cyclic stretch-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) of A549 cells could be inhibited by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) blockade. ATP concentrations were increased in conditioned supernatants from A549 cells, and in rabbit BAL fluids during VILI. Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by A549 cells conditioned supernatants was essentially dependent on fMLP rather than IL-8. A synergy between cyclic stretch-induced alarmins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found in monocyte-derived macrophages in the production of IL-1ÃŸ. CONCLUSIONS Mitochondrial alarmins are released during cyclic stretch of human epithelial cells, as well as in BAL fluids from rabbits ventilated with an injurious ventilatory regimen, and found in BAL fluids from ARDS patients, particularly in those with high alveolar inflammation. These alarmins are likely to represent the proximal endogenous mediators of VILI and ARDS, released by injured pulmonary cells.

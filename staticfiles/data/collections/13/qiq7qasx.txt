Abstract We carried out a study to determine if the high-neurovirulence GDVII strain of Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and the demyelinating, low-neurovirulence BeAn strain induced apoptosis in murine astrocytes. Astrocytes, the major glial cell population of the central nervous system, were semipermissive for GDVII virus replication. Programmed cell death, demonstrated by apoptosis-specific caspase-3 protease activity, was maximal 8 h after GDVII infection at an m.o.i. of 1. Purified TMEV capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 did not induce apoptosis but antibodies to VP1 and VP2 inhibited it. Antibody inhibition of caspase-3 activity as well as flow cytometry experiments implicated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TNF-α-receptor (TNF-R) in apoptosis signaling. Converselly, TNF-α and the TRAIL-receptor were not upregulated. Furthermore, the number of functional TNF-α receptors, but not their affinity, was increased in apoptotic GDVII virus-infected astrocytes, as confirmed in binding experiments with 125I-labeled recombinant murine TNF-α. In vivo studies showed that most of the cells loaded with the virus when injected in the brains of SJL mice were neurons but very few showed TUNEL costaining. Conversely, many of the apoptotic cells found were also positive for GFAP staining.

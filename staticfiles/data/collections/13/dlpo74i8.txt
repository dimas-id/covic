The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the management of head and neck cancer must be addressed. Immediate measures to reduce transmission rates and protect patients and providers take priority and necessitate some delays in care, particularly for patients with mild symptoms or less aggressive cancers. However, strict guidelines have yet to be developed, and many unintentional delays in care are to be expected based on the magnitude of the looming public health crisis. The medical complexity of head and neck cancer management may lead to prolonged delays that worsen treatment outcomes. Therefore, those caring for patients with head and neck cancer must take action to reduce these negative impacts as the country rallies to overcome the challenges posed by this pandemic.

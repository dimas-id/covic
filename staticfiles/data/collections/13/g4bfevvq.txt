Myriad conditions may affect both the neurologic system and the thorax, while other diseases primarily affecting the thorax may manifest with neurologic abnormalities. Correlation of signs, symptoms, and imaging findings in the neurological system with those in the thorax can help diagnose certain conditions and/or guide further diagnostic work-up and treatment. We will review and illustrate the imaging appearance of several systemic/neurological diseases with thoracic manifestations as well as discuss conditions in the thorax that can lead to neurologic symptoms.

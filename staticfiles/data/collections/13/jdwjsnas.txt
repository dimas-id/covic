The occurrence of antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV), parvovirus and Ehrlichia spp. in wild captive carnivores was evaluated in a zoological park in midwestern Brazil. Serum samples were collected between 2007 and 2014 from 45 carnivores. Antibodies were evaluated by virus neutralization assay for CDV, hemagglutination inhibition test for parvovirus, indirect immunofluorescent and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Ehrlichia spp. Antibodies against CDV and parvovirus were detected in 75% of Canidae and Felidae. Procyonidae were negative for CDV, although one Mustelidae was positive. TwoCanidae presented antibodies reactive to E. canis antigens. The high antibodies rates to CDV and parvovirus suggest the contact with both pathogens, however since no clinical history of disease are registered in the Zoo-UFMT, we can presume that carnivores have responded satisfactorily against the antigens. The low serological rates observed against Ehrlichia spp. may be resulted to the low occurrence of ticks among carnivores.(AU)

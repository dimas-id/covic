BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies of human adenovirus (HAdV) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients have been conducted mostly in European countries where HAdV 2 (species C) has been most prevalent in the community. The main objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology and the characteristics of HAdV infection in Korean allogeneic HCT recipients (<19 years). METHODS: In a prospective study from April 2012 to September 2015, HAdV in blood, urine, and stool specimens were monitored weekly from transplantation to day 100 or after if clinically suspected. HAdV infection was defined as positive HAdV PCR result in any specimens regardless of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 1734 specimens were collected from 57 consecutively enrolled recipients. The cumulative incidence of HAdV infection at day 100, and 1 year was 10%, and 20%, and the incidence of viremia was 2% and 6%, respectively. The median onset time from HCT to viremia was 221 days (range, 7‐596 days). All viremia cases were caused by only HAdV 3 (species B), whereas several types were detected in stool. Among patients with HAdV infection, lower absolute lymphocyte counts and extensive chronic graft‐vs‐host disease were associated with viremia (P = .028 and P = .006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to western studies, this study demonstrated a lower incidence and delayed onset of HAdV infections and HAdV 3 was most prevalent in Korea.

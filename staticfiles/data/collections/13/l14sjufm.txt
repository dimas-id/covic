Abstract A total of 12 clinically ill cats previously diagnosed as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) were treated with a combination of recombinant feline interferon and glucocorticoid. A complete remission (over 2 years) and a partial remission (2 to 5 months) were observed in four (33.3%) and four (33.3%) cases, respectively. Those that survived for more than 2 years were all older cats (6 to 16 years old) with the effusive form of FIP.

Unreasonable antibacterial therapy is suspected to be the main reason of emergence of multi-resistant bacteria. The connection between seasonal variability of antibiotic use and reasonable antibacterial therapy has been described. We examined the issue basing on the data obtained from the primary care system in Szczecin (Poland) in order to verify the situation in this region of Central Europe. Increase in antibiotic consumption in a viral infection season was proved to be statistically significant. Statistically significant differences in various drug forms dispensation were also observed. Increased consumption of antibiotics in seasons of influenza-like illnesses might be connected with a lack of proper diagnostics or numerous cases of bacterial co-infections.

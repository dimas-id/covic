The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the global health economies. As health care resources have been prioritised to cater for patients affected by COVID-19, routine health care services have remained suspended. In an effort to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the UK introduced a country-wide lockdown which came into effect on the 23rd March 2020. Since then, clinics offering laser and intense pulsed light services have remained closed for business. As the rate of COVID-19 infection slows, the UK government has issued guidance for lifting of the lockdown in a cautious and phased manner. With this in view and to facilitate safe resumption of laser and intense pulsed light services, the British Medical Laser Services has issued this guidance document, based on best available and current scientific evidence.

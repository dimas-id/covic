OBJECTIVE The Enterprise stent is the first closed-cell stent designed to treat wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. Advantages of the design can include improvement in keeping coils within an aneurysm and the ability of the stent to be recaptured. We compared the technical and clinical complications of the Enterprise stent with the open-cell Neuroform stent, its primary alternative. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patients undergoing Enterprise and Neuroform stent-assisted aneurysm coiling were enrolled in prospective registries starting in March 2007 and February 2003, respectively. All consecutive patients through December 2011 were included. Deployment success and difficulty, stent movement and misplacement, and procedural complications were compared. RESULTS Enterprise deployment success was high (108 of 115 attempts, 93.9%) with 102 aneurysms receiving a stent compared with Neuroform (173 of 214 attempts, 80.8%, p = 0.001) with 163 aneurysms. Enterprise was easier to deploy (1.7% vs 15.9% difficult deployment, p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in the rates of stent movement, misplacement, or symptomatic hemorrhage. Symptomatic thromboembolic events, however, were more frequent with the Enterprise stent (8.7% vs 1.4%, p = 0.0021). The Enterprise stent enabled treatment of 10 additional aneurysms that could not be treated with Neuroform and had a higher rate of immediate aneurysm occlusion (87.3% vs 73.0%, p = 0.0058). CONCLUSION Enterprise was easier to deploy and enabled treatment of additional aneurysms; however, there were more thromboembolic complications. On the basis of these findings, we prefer to use the Neuroform stent first and rely on the Enterprise stent as an easy-to-deliver backup for stent-assisted coiling.

This paper discusses a novel theory of senescence: the community of pathogens within each host individual evolves during the life-time of the host, and in doing so progressively reduces host vigour. I marshal evidence that asymptomatic host individuals maintain persistent populations of viral pathogens; that these pathogens replicate; that they are often extremely variable; that selection within hosts causes the evolution of pathogens better able to exploit the host; that selection is host-specific; and that such evolving infections cause appreciable and progressive deterioration. Experimental approaches to testing the theory are discussed.

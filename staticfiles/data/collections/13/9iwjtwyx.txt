BACKGROUND. More than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been confirmed. While PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis, high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. METHODS. A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS. Fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subjects, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects. INTERPRETATION. Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through-put of samples/day. FUNDING.

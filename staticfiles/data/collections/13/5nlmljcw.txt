Abstract The complete nucleotide sequences of the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), and fusion protein (F) genes of 15 Canadian human metapneumovirus (hMPV) isolates were determined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct genetic clusters, or groups for each gene with additional sequence variability within the individual groups. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences for the N, M and F genes of the different isolates revealed that all three genes were well conserved with 94.1–97.6% identity between the two distinct clusters The P gene showed more diversity with 81.6–85.7% amino acid identity for isolates between the two clusters, and 94.6–100% for isolates within the same cluster.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the concordance between ventilator-associated events (VAE) and ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), and their impact on outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in five 10-bed ICUs of a teaching hospital, during a 2-year period. Ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were prospectively diagnosed. The agreement between VAE, VAT and VAP was assessed by k statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1059 patients (15,029 ventilator-days) were included. 268 VAP (17.8 per 1000 ventilator-days), 127 VAT (8.5 per 1000 ventilator-days) and 262 VAE (17.4 per 1000 ventilator-days) were diagnosed. There was no agreement between VAT and VAE, and the agreement was poor between VAP and VAE (k = 0.12, 95% CI 0.03â€“0.20). VAE and VA-LRTI were associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. VAP, VAT and VAE were not significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement was poor between VAE and VAP. No agreement was found between VAE and VAT. VAE episodes were significantly associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, but not with ICU mortality.

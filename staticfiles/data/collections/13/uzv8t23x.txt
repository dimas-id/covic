Background: There are apprehensions amongst healthcare worker (HCWs) about COVID-19. The HCWs have been given hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) chemoprophylaxis for seven weeks as per Government of India guidelines. Objectives: To assess the apprehensions amongst HCWs about COVID-19 and to document accessibility, adherence and side effects related to HCQ prophylaxis in HCWs. Methods: A longitudinal follow up study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. HCQ was given in the dose of 400 mg twice on day one, and then 400 mg weekly for seven weeks. 391 HCWs were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire. Results: 62.2% HCWs expressed perceived danger posted by COVID-19 infection. Doctors (54%) showed least acceptance and paramedics (88%) showed highest acceptance to chemoprophylaxis. 17.5% participants developed at least one of the side effects to HCQ. Females and nursing profession were significantly associated with adverse effects. Common side effects were gastro-intestinal symptoms, headache and abnormal mood change. Most of these were mild, not requiring any intervention. Gender, professions and perceived threat of COVID-19 were significantly associated with acceptance and adherence to HCQ prophylaxis. Conclusion: Two thirds of HCWs had perceived danger due to COVID-19. Three fourth of the HCWs accepted chemoprophylaxis and four out of five who accepted had complete adherence to prophylaxis schedule. One out of five had developed at least one of side effects; however, most of these were mild not requiring any intervention.

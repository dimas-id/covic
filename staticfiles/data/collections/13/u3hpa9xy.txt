PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review describes the range of cases now available in the interventional radiology suite and summarizes suggestions for their anaesthetic and perioperative management. RECENT FINDINGS The type and complexity of interventional radiology cases being performed increases from year to year. Anaesthesiologists' presence in interventional radiology is increasing in turn, due to increasingly ill patients and intricate procedures requiring more than local anaesthesia for well tolerated completion. The literature available describing this is largely written by radiologists, with little attention paid to anaesthetic considerations. SUMMARY Cases in interventional radiology are complex in terms of the logistics of working in an unfamiliar area, frequency of patient comorbidity and unfamiliar procedures. Ensuring familiarity with the variety of interventional radiology procedures and their periprocedure requirements can increase anaesthesiologists' comfort in interventional radiology.

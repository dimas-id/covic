Abstract The synthesis of several (3-noradamantyl)amines, [(3-noradamantyl)methyl]amines, (3,7-dimethyl-1-bisnoradamantyl)amines, and [(3,7-dimethyl-1-bisnoradamantyl)methyl]amines is reported. They were evaluated against a wide range of viruses and one of them inhibited the cytopathicity of influenza A virus at a concentration similar to that of amantadine. Several of the new polycyclic amines show an interesting activity as NMDA receptor antagonists. A rimantadine analogue displayed significant trypanocidal activity. Moreover, to further characterize the pharmacology of these compounds, their effects on dopamine uptake were also assessed.

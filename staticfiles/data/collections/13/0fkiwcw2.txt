Endogenous IL‐12 production is hypothesized to play an essential role preventing spontaneous expression of type 2 responses, acting as a natural inhibitor limiting development of immediate hypersensitivity. Here, IL‐12‐deficient p35(– / –) and p40(– / –) mice were used to examine the role of endogenous IL‐12 and p40 homodimer during in vivo development of exogenous antigen‐driven responses. In the absence of deliberate immunization, IL‐12‐deficient mice exhibited greatly reduced serum IgG2a but IgG1 / IgE levels no higher than controls. Immunization to elicit polarized ovalbumin‐specific type 1 or type 2 dominant responses, or using Trichinella spiralis extract in the absence of adjuvants, led to IFN‐γ production of approximately 10 % of C57BL / 6 controls yet the kinetics and intensity of primary and secondary type 2 cytokine (IL‐4, IL‐5, IL‐13) and antibody (IgG1, IgE) responses, as well as functional IL‐12 receptor expression, were consistently unaltered. Thus, while IL‐12 provides an important positive signal for Th1 development, antigen exposure in its absence does not lead to generalized enhancement of type 2 cytokine or antibody responses. The data argue that endogenous IL‐12 production is not required as a constitutive negative regulator limiting induction or expression of type 2 effector responses.

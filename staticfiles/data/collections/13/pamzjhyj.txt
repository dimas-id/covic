The study sought to ascertain the incidence rates and risk factors for 30-day post-operative complications after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Complications were categorized as systemic or local and subcategorized as major or minor. There were 17,640 individuals who received primary THA identified from the 2006-2011 ACS NSQIP. The mortality rate was 0.35% and complications occurred in 4.9%. Age groups ≥ 80 years (P <0.001) and 70-79 years old (P = 0.003), and renal insufficiency (P = 0.02) best predicted mortality. Age ≥80 years (P <0.001) and cardiac disease (P = 0.01) were the strongest predictors of developing any postoperative complication. Morbid obesity (P <0.001) and operative time > 141 minutes (P <0.001) were strongly associated with the development of major local complications.

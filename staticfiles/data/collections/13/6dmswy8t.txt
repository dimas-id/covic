Enterovirus 70 (EV70) is the causative agent of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), for which no effective vaccine is available. This study revealed a high reactivity of the N-terminal region of EV70 VP1 (VP1-1) with an anti-EV70 mouse serum. The analysis of overlapping synthetic peptides of VP1-1 identified a B-cell epitope in this region. The E-peptide (14-ANTVESEIKAELGVI-28) showing the highest reactivity with the anti-EV70 serum induced neutralizing antibodies in mice and reduced the virus titer in the eyes, suggesting that it is a candidate vaccine against AHC caused by EV70.

The epitope specificity of the protective immune response against swine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) has been investigated by using circulating and secretory antibodies. This study was carried out with sows vaccinated with TGEV or the antigenically related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). TGEV vaccination of sows resulted in greater lactogenic protection of suckling piglets against TGEV challenge and a higher secretory immune response than PRCV vaccination did. These differences in the immune response were conditioned by the route of antigen presentation as a result of the different tropism of each virus. Epitopes on S protein, and in particular those contained in its antigenic site. A, were more immunogenic than epitopes on N and M proteins in both groups of vaccinated sows, as determined by a competitive radioimmunoassay. Minor differences in antibody response against the previously defined antigenic subsites Aa, Ab, and Ac were also detected, with subsite Ab being the most antigenic in both TGEV- and PRCV-immune sows. These findings suggest that antigenic site A on S protein, involved in virus neutralization, is the immunodominant site in pregnant sows that confer lactogenic protection. They also validate, in experiments with secretory antibodies, the antigenic maps made with murine monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, this antigenic site should be considered for vaccine or diagnostic development.

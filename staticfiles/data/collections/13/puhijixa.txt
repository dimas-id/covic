BACKGROUND: This pilot study was conducted to determine whether supplementing standard classroom training methods regarding respiratory disease transmission with a visual demonstration could improve the use of personal protective equipment among emergency department nurses. METHODS: Participants included 20 emergency department registered nurses randomized into 2 groups: control and intervention. The intervention group received supplemental training using the visual demonstration of respiratory particle dispersion. Both groups were then observed throughout their work shifts as they provided care during January-March 2005. RESULTS: Participants who received supplemental visual training correctly utilized personal protective equipment statistically more often than did participants who received only the standard classroom training. CONCLUSION: Supplementing the standard training methods with a visual demonstration can improve the use of personal protective equipment during care of patients exhibiting respiratory symptoms.

BACKGROUND The problem of intensive care unit methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections has led to routine surveillance and eradication strategies. METHODS Our surgical intensive care unit (SICU) admissions receive MRSA nares cultures and if positive are isolated followed by eradication treatment. This strategy was retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Our nares-positive culture rate was 21% (30/145), and the sputum positive (sputum+) rate was 18% (26/145). Positive nares culture (Nares+) was eradicated in 63%. The rate of sputum+ in Nares+ patients was 36% (9/25). The rate of sputum+ in Nares- was 10% (12/115; P = .003). The sputum+ SICU length of stay (LOS) (18 ± 12 days in 23 S+ patients) is longer than in sputum- (10 ± 9 days in 69 S-patients, P = .0002). CONCLUSIONS This SICU has high rates of both nares and sputum MRSA cultures. Our data suggest eradicating nares colonization may prevent pneumonia and might decrease SICU LOS.

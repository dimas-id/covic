Our understanding of the antiviral actions of IFIT1, one of the most strongly induced interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), has advanced remarkably within the last few years. This review focuses on the recent cellular, biochemical, and structural discoveries that have provided new insight as to how IFIT1 functions as both a sensor and effector molecule of the cellular innate immune system. IFIT1 can detect viral RNA lacking 2’-O methylation on their cap structures or displaying a 5’-triphosphate moiety and inhibit their translation or sequester them from active replication. Because of these inhibitory actions, many viruses have evolved unique mechanisms to evade IFIT1 to facilitate replication, spread of infection, and disease pathogenesis.

Abstract Enveloped viruses, which include many medically important viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus and hepatitis C virus, are intracellular parasites that acquire lipid envelopes from their host cells. Success of replication is intimately linked to their ability to hijack host cell mechanisms, particularly those related to membrane dynamics and lipid metabolism. Despite recent progress, our knowledge of lipid mediated virusâ€“host interactions remains highly incomplete. In addition, diverse experimental systems are used to study different stages of virus replication thus complicating comparisons. This review aims to present a unifying view of the widely diverse strategies used by enveloped viruses at distinct stages of their replication cycles.

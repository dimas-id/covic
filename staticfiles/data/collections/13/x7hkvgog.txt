Nowadays, remote healthcare monitoring systems (RHMS) are attracting patients, doctors and caregivers. RHMS reduces the number of unessential hospitalizations by providing the required healthcare services for patients at home. Furthermore, continuous health monitoring using RHMS is a hopeful solution for elderly people suffering from chronic diseases. RHMS is in general three tiers architecture where the first tier uses intelligent wearable sensors to gather physiological signs. The majority of wearable sensors constructors commercialized sensing devices with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication interfaces, which lead to the development of diverse RHMS deploying BLE communication interfaces for physiological patient data gathering. In this paper, we introduce the basic concepts related to RHMS design and development. Besides that, we focus our investigation on the BLE communication protocol used in the healthcare context and its configuration to sense several physiological data. Also, we highlight the different steps enabling reading sensed data on mobile application.

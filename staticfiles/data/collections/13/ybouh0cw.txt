Taiwan is situated less than 200 km from the first Covid‐19 outbreak state, China, and has millions of international visitors yearly. Taiwan's collective efforts to block and eliminate the invisible enemy (Covid‐19) from the island, have resulted in relatively low infection and death numbers, and were hailed as a successful anomaly amid the global pandemic. In this review, I pinpoint some background on the systems and organizations that helped Taiwan streamline a task force (Command Center) in a timely manner to launch related initiatives, mobilize the public, and engage private resources to implement the strategies and policies which were further enhanced by collaborative behaviors and volunteers. Also, even subject to similar threatening conditions such as cruise ship stopover and numerous foreign immigrant workers, there were no outbreaks of community infection in Taiwan similar to Singapore, Japan, etc. Taiwan's successful measures offer good example for future comparative studies.

INTRODUCTION Morbid obesity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery offers morbidly obese individuals substantial and sustainable weight loss and reduction in obesity-related comorbidities. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a new restrictive procedure in bariatric surgery. We aimed to evaluate our experience with LSG with regard to its safety and feasibility and early weight loss. METHODS The surgical outcome, complications and early clinical results of all patients who underwent LSG at Singapore General Hospital were studied. RESULTS 30 patients underwent LSG between December 2008 and October 2010. The mean preoperative weight of the patients was 113.4 (range 91.0-170.0) kg, while the mean body mass index (BMI) was 42.6 (range 33.0-60.0) kg/m². Diabetes mellitus was present in 39 percent of the patients, hypertension in 43 percent, hyperlipidaemia in 35 percent, obstructive sleep apnoea in 30 percent and osteoarthritis in 22 percent. The majority of patients had two or more obesity-related comorbidities (52 percent). Mean operative time was 142 (range 80-220) minutes and median duration of postoperative stay was three days. At two weeks, one, three and six months post operation, the mean BMI was 38.6 kg/m², 37.8 kg/m², 34.5 kg/m² and 30.8 kg/m², the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 17.7 percent, 23.3 percent, 40.9 percent and 56.7 percent, and absolute weight loss was 8.00 kg, 11.52 kg, 18.77 kg and 26.85 kg, respectively. CONCLUSION LSG is a promising procedure for surgical treatment of obesity, with good early weight loss and low morbidity.

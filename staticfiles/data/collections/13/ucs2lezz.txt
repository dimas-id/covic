The extreme 5′ end of the leader sequence of four equine arteritis virus (EAV) strains was obtained by using rapid amplification of cDNA end method (5′ RACE), and sequenced. Seventeen more nucleotides were added upstream of the 5′ end of the EAV published genomic sequence. A common feature among the analyzed EAV isolates was the presence of an AUG start codon within the added sequence and the appearance of an intraleader open reading frame (ORF) of 111 nucleotides which was predicted to encode a peptide of 37 amino acids. The role of this putative intraleader ORF has yet to be determined.

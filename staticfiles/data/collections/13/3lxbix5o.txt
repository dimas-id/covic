Pyocystis, empyema cystis, vesical empyema are all terms that describe the purulent filled bladder that may develop in patients with defunctionalized bladders such as after supravesical urinary diversion without cystectomy or in patients with end-stage renal disease with anuria. It is a severe form of lower urinary tract infection. In addition to the local symptoms of suprapubic pain and malodorous discharge, the condition can be more serious with bacterial dissemination into the blood stream and ensuing sepsis and even mortality. The current review will discuss the pathogenesis, risk factors and management of this commonly forgotten complication of urinary diversion.

On March 11th, 2020, the WHO declared the SARS‐Cov‐2 pandemic. Syndromes have been detected in relation to COVID‐19 such as encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy and cerebrovascular complications. There are also cases of peripheral nervous system involvement. Our case would be the 3rd patient with MFS associated with COVID‐19 as far as we know. We present a 51 years old female diagnosed with MFS two weeks after COVID‐19. RT‐PCR to SARS‐CoV‐2 was negative but IgG was positive. Most of the cases were mild or moderate with typical signs and symptoms. All were treated with IV immunoglobulin with good response in most cases. Despite the short evolution time of the cases surviving the current pandemic, the description of cases of post‐infectious neurological syndromes suggests that this is probably not an infrequent complication in the subacute stage of Covid‐19 disease.

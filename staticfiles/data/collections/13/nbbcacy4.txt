Abstract Concerns on negative effects of urbanization on the environment make the aerodynamic properties of urban areas increasingly important in architectural design, particularly at high density cities. Over the past few decades, a rapid development in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has resulted in the widespread use of this technique not only as an environmental research tool but also as an architectural design tool. However, given real building morphologies and particular architectural requirements for the modeling and data analysis, the frequently used methods in research work are unsuitable for practical application. Therefore, this study focuses on the practical application of CFD to bridge the gap between wind engineering and architectural design. This study aims to provide a framework to accurately predict the pedestrian level wind environment, and identify the wind-related design issues. The methods are provided to answer the questions encountered by wind consultants and architects, particularly those on the input boundary condition, simulation modeling, modeling verification, data collection and analysis. The hypothesis testing method is introduced in the framework to verify and evaluate the simulation results. A Hong Kong case study is presented to illustrate that the framework and methods can work well.

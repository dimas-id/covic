BACKGROUND: Most articles describing the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on neurosurgical services have been from developed countries. We report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. METHODS: To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health's online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). RESULTS: Compared with other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To increase our understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we divided the period into 4 phases: phase 1 (when there were confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases in Yogyakarta), phase 2 (when the first case in Yogyakarta was detected), phase 3 (when the cumulative cases surpass their peak), and phase 4 (when the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 per week. CONCLUSIONS: A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities. A comprehensive plan can improve both utilization and safety of the neurosurgical staff.

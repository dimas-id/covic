PURPOSE Laparoscopic hernia repair has emerged as an effective alternative method for treating inguinal hernias. It has several significant advantages over the tension-free open repair now in use. In this report we summarize our laparoscopic hernia repair results and recommendations. METHODS The transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) procedures for groin hernias performed between January 2003 and January 2008 at a single center were analyzed retrospectively. Individual surgeon performances were compared to determine whether the rates of complications were related to the level of surgeon experience. RESULTS A total of 312 TAPP procedures were reviewed, and 284 (91%) of the patients were followed retrospectively. There were 266 (85.25%) males and 46 (14.75%) females. The average age was 57.4 years. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.1 days. The mean duration of surgery was 35 min. Six (1.92%) intraoperative and seven (2.24%) postoperative complications were noted. Two recurrences occurred (0.70%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair has proven to be an efficient method for the treatment of groin hernias at our institution. Most patients can be treated as day-cases, namely they are hospitalized for 1 day, and they demonstrate a low recurrence rate (0.70%). Such low morbidity makes TAPP an attractive method for the routine treatment of groin hernias.

BACKGROUND Patients with M2 middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions are not always considered for endovascular treatment. OBJECTIVE To study outcomes in patients with M2 occlusion treated with endovascular procedures in the era of stentrievers. METHODS We studied patients prospectively included in the SONIIA registry (years 2011-2012)-a mandatory, externally audited registry that monitors the quality of reperfusion therapies in Catalonia in routine practice. Good recanalization was defined as postprocedure Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score 2b-3; dramatic recovery as drop in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >10 points or NIHSS score <2 at 24-36 h; and good outcome as modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-2 at 3months. A 24 h CT scan determined symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) and infarct volume. RESULTS Of 571 patients who received endovascular treatment, 65 (11.4%) presented an M2 occlusion on initial angiogram, preprocedure NIHSS 16 (IQR 6). Mean time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 289 Â± 195 min. According to interventionalist preferences 86.2% (n=56) were treated with stentrievers (n=7 in combination with intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), 4.6% (n=3) received intra-arterial tPA only, and 9.2% (n=6) diagnostic angiography only. Good recanalization (78.5%) was associated with dramatic improvement (48% vs 14.8%; p=0.02), smaller infarct volumes (8 vs 82 cc; p=0.01) and better outcome (mRS 0-2: 66.3% vs 30%; p=0.03). SICH (9%) was not associated with treatment modality or device used. After adjusting for age and preprocedure NIHSS, good recanalization emerged as an independent predictor of dramatic improvement (OR=5.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 29.2), p=0.03). Independent predictors of good outcome at 3 months were age ( OR=1.067 (95% CI 1.005 to 1132), p=0.03) and baseline NIHSS ( OR=1.162 (95% CI 1.041 to 1.297), p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of M2 MCA occlusion with stentrievers seems safe. Induced recanalization may double the chances of achieving a favorable outcome, especially for patients with moderate or severe deficit.

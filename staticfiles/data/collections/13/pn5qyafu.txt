OBJECTIVE To determine the ability of an intraoperative cell salvage (IOCS) system and a leukocyte reduction filter (LRF) to remove hemangiosarcoma (HSA) cells from canine blood. STUDY DESIGN Cultured HSA cells were added to canine blood to simulate intraoperative hemorrhage and address hemoabdomen from ruptured splenic HSA. The blood/HSA cell mixture was processed through an IOCS, followed by LRF processing. SAMPLE POPULATION Whole blood from 3 healthy dogs combined with cultured HSA cells. METHODS The ability of quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), multiparameter flow cytometry, and cytologic examination to detect 50 HSA cells per milliliter of culture media was confirmed. RT-PCR, multiparameter flow cytometry, and cytologic examination were used to determine the presence of cultured HSA cells at 4 points during processing. RESULTS HSA cells were found in all control samples and in all samples after IOCS but prior to LRF processing with all 3 cell detection methods. HSA cells were not found after IOCS/LRF processing with all 3 cell detection methods. CONCLUSION IOCS combined with LRF processing is able to remove cultured HSA cells from canine blood. The addition of LRF to IOCS may allow application of IOCS in dogs with HSA. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE A combination of IOCS and LRF processing may provide an alternative to allogeneic blood transfusion in dogs with hemoabdomen due to HSA.

Diarrheic feces from 21 calves were examined by electron microscopy and 16 contained particles morphologically similar to those of Breda virus. The particles were spherical or elongated, 60–270 nm in greatest dimension and had surface spikes 9–13 nm long. Convalescent serum from a human patient with Breda virus-associated diarrhea reacted with one of the bovine viruses by immune electron microscopy, suggesting a serological resemblance between human and bovine Breda-like viruses. Immune electron-microscopy and immunofluorescence demonstrated that isolates of bovine Breda virus from the U.S.A. were related to the French virus. One of the viruses had a density in sucrose solution of 1.16, similar to the value for Berne virus.

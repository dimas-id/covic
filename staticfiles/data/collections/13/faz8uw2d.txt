In December 2019, COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. The current study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 complicated by hypertension. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 110 discharged patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 25 to February 20, 2020. All study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of hypertension. Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs. The mean age of 110 patients was 57.7 years (range, 25-86 years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients. The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96 × 109/L vs 1.26 × 109/L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission. The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

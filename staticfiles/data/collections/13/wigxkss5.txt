Caecal diverticulitis is an uncommon phenomenon in western countries. The clinical diagnosis is often difficult as it mimics other acute abdominal conditions like appendicitis, colitis or neoplasia. Diagnosis is often made at operation. Operative strategy has been controversial and there is no broad consensus emerging. We report the case of a 71-year-old woman, known to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented acutely with right iliac fossa pain. A clinical diagnosis of appendicitis was made. At laparoscopy, a solitary, inflamed, gangrenous caecal diverticulum was found. A laparoscopic stapled diverticulectomy was performed. The patient made a steady post-operative recovery. Histology confirmed diverticulitis. We conclude that stapled diverticulectomy for solitary caecal diverticulitis is a safe and effective surgical strategy when confronted with this scenario.

In April 2004, two patients were admitted to hospital in Berlin, Germany, with clinical signs of acute respiratory infection after returning from a military exercise in their home country of Turkey. They were admitted to a high security infectious disease unit as epidemiological data pointed to an outbreak of unknown etiology. Samples taken at the time of admission proved to be strongly positive for Adenovirus by PCR, but negative for Influenza A/H1N1 virus, Influenza A/H3N2 virus, Influenza B virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS coronavirus. No evidence for bacterial infection was obtained by serological tests and blood cultures. The adenovirus detected was characterized further by genotyping and was identified as a species B2 virus with the highest similarity to adenovirus type 11a. J. Med.

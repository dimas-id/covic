This study was designed to assess risk factors for neurocognitive impairment in patients with benign intracranial lesions including tumors and vascular lesions. 74 patients (29 m, 51 f, mean age 54.4 years) with surgery for benign intracranial lesions were included in this prospective single-center study. Extensive neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively, including tests for attention, memory and executive functions. Furthermore, headache and depression were assessed using the german version of the HDI (IBK) and the BDI-II. Multiple linear regression analyses of the percentile ranks (adjusted for age, sex and education) including the parameters age, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS), mood, pain and lesion size were performed to identify risk factors for cognitive impairment. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, the influence of hemisphere and type of lesion (tumor/vascular) was assessed. Posthoc Bonferroni correction was performed. Poorer neurocognitive functions were observed only in the category attention in patients with higher age (divided attention, WMS) and reduced KPS (WMS). Lesion volume, mood, pain, hemisphere or the type of the lesion (tumor, vascular) were not identified as risk factors for poorer neurocognitive functions in patients with benign intracranial lesions. Age and KPS are the main risk factors for poorer neurocognitive functions in the category attention in patients with benign intracranial lesions. Knowledge of these risk factors might be important to find appropriate therapy regimes to improve cognitive functions and quality of life.

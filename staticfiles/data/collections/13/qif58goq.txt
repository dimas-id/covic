Porous media and conduit coupled systems are heavily used in a variety of areas such as groundwater system, petroleum extraction, and biochemical transport. A coupled dual porosity Stokes model has been proposed to simulate the fluid flow in a dual-porosity media and conduits coupled system. Data assimilation is the discipline that studies the combination of mathematical models and observations. It can improve the accuracy of mathematical models by incorporating data, but also brings challenges by increasing complexity and computational cost. In this paper, we study the application of data assimilation methods to the coupled dual porosity Stokes model. We give a brief introduction to the coupled model and examine the performance of different data assimilation methods on a finite element implementation of the coupled dual porosity Stokes system. We also study how observations on different variables of the system affect the data assimilation process.

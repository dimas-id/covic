Five nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb) generated to the virulent Miller strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and specific for the S protein were characterized. Competition assays between purified and biotinylated MAb indicated that MAb 75B10 and 8G11 mapped near a new subsite, designated V and 2 MAb, 44C11 and 45A8, mapped to a previously designated subsite D. A fifth MAb mapped between subsites V and E. These MAb were tested with 3 previously characterized MAb to subsites A, E, and F in fixed-cell ELISA and cell culture immunofluorescent assays against 5 reference and 9 field strains of TGEV and 2 US strains (ISU-1 and ISU-3) of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). Subsites A, E, and F were conserved on all TGEV and PRCV strains examined. The 2 MAb to subsite V, 8G11 and 75B10, reacted only with the Miller TGEV strains (M5C, M6, and M60), except that 75B10 also recognized field strain U328. The MAb 11H8 did not react with 4 field strains or the Purdue strains of TGEV. The 2 MAb to subsite D reacted with all TGEV strains examined, but not with 2 US PRCV strains, 2 European PRCV strains, 1 feline infectious peritonitis virus strain, and 1 canine coronavirus strain. Because of this specificity for TGEV, but not PRCV, these latter 2 subsite D MAb may be useful for the development of competition ELISA to differentiate serologically between TGEV and PRCV infections in swine, similar to the currently used European subsite D MAb.

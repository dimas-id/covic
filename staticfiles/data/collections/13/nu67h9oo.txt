We report here the clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and successful surgical management associated with triceps tendon avulsion in a dog. A definitive diagnosis of triceps tendon avulsion was made based on MRI with evidence of displacement of the triceps tendon. Surgical correction of triceps tendon avulsion was performed with two horizontal mattress sutures using polyester and two tunnels drilled in the olecranon to reattach the tendon to the proximal olecranon. At 9 months, there was no evidence of lameness on the left thoracic limb. This is the first case report to describe MRI evaluation for the diagnosis of the triceps tendon avulsion.

In a recent paper entitled, "COVID-19 Related School Closings and Risk of Weight Gain Among Children" Rundle et al. (2020) proposed the COVID-19 pandemic may increase obesity among American children because the pandemic, "will likely double out-of-school time this year for many children in the United States and will exacerbate the risk factors for weight gain associated with summer recess" (pg. 1). I add support to Rundle et al.'s argument by demonstrating that doubling of out-of-school time alone may lead to a sizable increase in childhood obesity.

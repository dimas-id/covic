Abstract Herein we report a description of gross and microscopic lesions found in specific pathogen-free chicken embryos caused by UNAM-97 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variant strain after the eighth passage. Embryos were divided into three groups and were inoculated in the chorioallantoic sac with 0.2 mL of UNAM-97, Mass 41 IBV (positive control), or sterile PBS (negative control). Forty-eight hours later the allatoic fluid was taken and used to start a cycle of eight passages through 9-d-old embryos. Seven days after the last passage, embryos were harvested and macroscopic lesions in all organs were recorded. Proventriculus and gizzard samples were obtained from all embryos and routinely processed for microscopic and ultrastructural examinations. The UNAM-97 IBV variant strain caused two macroscopic lesions uncommon for Mexican strains: thin-walled proventriculus and gizzard, as well as urate accumulation within an extra-embryonic peritoneal sac, leaving the body through the umbilical duct and accompanied by the yolk sac. At microscopic level, two relevant findings were observed to be produced by this variant. In the proventriculus, there was a decrease in the gland papillary branching, while the gizzard showed a significant reduction in mucosa thickness and tubular-to-proliferative-cell ratio, as well as an absence of hyaline secretion in the lumen. Electrodense material scattered in proventricular and gizzard cells was observed, with a structure consistent with that of coronaviruses. These pathological chicken embryo findings have not been reported as being caused by other IBV strains in Mexico.

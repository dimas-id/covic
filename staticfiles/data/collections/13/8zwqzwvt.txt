BACKGROUND Both vedolizumab and ustekinumab can be considered for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) when anti-TNF treatment fails. However, head-to-head trials are currently not available or planned. AIM To compare vedolizumab and ustekinumab in Crohn´s disease patients in a prospective registry specifically developed for comparative studies with correction for confounders. METHODS Crohn´s disease patients, who failed anti-TNF treatment and started vedolizumab or ustekinumab in standard care as second-line biological, were identified in the observational prospective Dutch Initiative on Crohn and Colitis Registry. Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (Harvey Bradshaw Index ≤4), biochemical remission (C-reactive protein ≤5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin ≤250 µg/g), combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission, and safety outcomes were compared after 52 weeks of treatment. To adjust for confounding and selection bias, we used multiple logistic regression and propensity score matching. RESULTS In total, 128 vedolizumab- and 85 ustekinumab-treated patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. After adjusting for confounders, ustekinumab-treated patients were more likely to achieve corticosteroid-free clinical remission (odds ratio [OR]: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.36-4.90, P = 0.004), biochemical remission (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.10-4.96, P = 0.027), and combined corticosteroid-free clinical and biochemical remission (OR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.23-6.09, P = 0.014), while safety outcomes (infections: OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.63-2.54, P = 0.517; adverse events: OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.62-2.81, P = 0.464; hospitalisations: OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.32-1.39, P = 0.282) were comparable between the two groups. The propensity score matched cohort with sensitivity analyses showed comparable results. CONCLUSION Ustekinumab was associated with superior effectiveness outcomes when compared to vedolizumab while safety outcomes were comparable after 52 weeks of treatment in CD patients who have failed anti-TNF treatment.

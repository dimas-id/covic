Since the declaration of COVID‐19 as global pandemic, several countries including India have enforced a national quarantine.We aimed to compare the perceived stress of Dermatologists and non‐dermatologists, due to quarantine and COVID‐19 pandemic and analyze the role of possible risk‐factors. We conducted a web‐based cross‐sectional study to determine the perceived stress of doctors using the Perceived stress scale‐10 and evaluate possible risk‐factors. Among 384 valid responders,we had 37.5% dermatologists and 62.5% non‐dermatologists. Perceived stress was more in non‐dermatologists compared to dermatologists, but not statistically significant (P = 0.1). Degree of stress was also comparable (P = 0.5). Higher stress was significantly associated with females and unmarried individuals in both groups. Risk of infecting self or colleagues or family members and lack of protective gear at work‐place were top causes of stress. Perceived stress is increased in all doctors due to COVID‐19 pandemic and quarantine. Even dermatologists have developed high‐stress due to current situation, comparable to non‐dermatologists, despite being traditionally considered an out‐patient speciality with minimum stress. Thus, proper mental health care policies should be adopted for all doctors, including dermatologists. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

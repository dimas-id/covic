Bcl2-associated athanogene (BAG) 3, which is a chaperone-mediated selective autophagy protein, plays a pivotal role in modulating the life cycle of a wide variety of viruses. Both positive and negative modulations of viruses by BAG3 were reported. However, the effects of BAG3 on pseudorabies virus (PRV) remain unknown. To investigate whether BAG3 could modulate the PRV life cycle during a lytic infection, we first identified PRV protein UL56 (pUL56) as a novel BAG3 interactor by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analyses. The overexpression of pUL56 induced a significant degradation of BAG3 at protein level via the lysosome pathway. The C-terminal mutations of (181)L/A, (185)L/A, or (181)L/A-(185)L/A in pUL56 resulted in a deficiency in pUL56-induced BAG3 degradation. In addition, the pUL56 C-terminal mutants that lost Golgi retention abrogated pUL56-induced BAG3 degradation, which indicates a Golgi retention-dependent manner. Strikingly, BAG3 was not observed to be degraded in either wild-type or UL56-deleted PRV infected cells as compared to mock infected ones, whereas the additional two adjacent BAG3 cleaved products were found in the infected cells in a species-specific manner. Overexpression of BAG3 significantly suppressed PRV proliferation, while knockdown of BAG3 resulted in increased viral yields in HEK293T cells. Thus, these data indicated a negative regulation role of BAG3 during PRV lytic infection. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel molecular mechanism on host protein degradation induced by PRV pUL56. Moreover, we identified BAG3 as a host restricted protein during PRV lytic infection in cells.

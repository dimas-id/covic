Abstract The influence of the microbiota on viral infection susceptibility and disease outcome is undisputable although varies among viruses. The purpose of understanding the interactions between microbiota, virus, and host is to identify practical, effective, and safe approaches that target microbiota for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases in humans and animals, as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available. The initial step for achieving this goal is to gather clinical evidences, focusing on the viral pathogens—from human and animal studies—that have already been shown to interact with microbiota. The subsequent step is to identify mechanisms, through experimental evidences, to support the development of translational applications that target microbiota. In this chapter, we review evidences of virus infections altering microbiota and of microbiota enhancing or suppressing infectivity, altering host susceptibility to certain viral diseases, and influencing vaccine immunogenicity in humans and farm animals.

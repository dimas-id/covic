The present study provides an overview of the food related behavior of the Spanish population during the confinement period due to the Covid-19 sanitary emergency. A national survey was responded by 600 volunteers, who answered questions related to food consumption, home-food and cooking related habits (F&C), and the Spanish version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. In general, most consumers could be considered “External eaters”; F&C questionnaire allowed segmenting the population in “low-cooking engagement”, “health -concerned” and “health-disregarded” groups. These consumers’ segments reported different behavior, highlighting, for example, the increase of snacks and ultra-processed food consumption of the health-disregarded group.

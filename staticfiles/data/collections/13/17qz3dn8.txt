We report a case of Yersinia enterocolitica sepsis syndrome and the acute respiratory distress syndrome in a chronically transfused adolescent with beta-thalassemia. This manifestation of serious Y. enterocolitica infection has not previously been reported. Dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever were the principal features of the clinical presentation. The acute onset of respiratory symptoms occurred after appendectomy. Chest radiographs revealed frontal bilateral infiltrates and alveolar consolidation to three quadrants. Y. enterocolitica was identified from blood and intraoperative appendix cultures. Although there was no need for mechanical ventilation, a remarkable persistence of clinical and X-ray findings was noted. Therapy with high levels of oxygen, and intravenous amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam led to a favorable outcome.

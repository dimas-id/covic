Background After its emergence in China in December 2019, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread infecting more than 3 million people worldwide. South America is among the last regions hit by COVID-19 pandemic. In Uruguay, first cases were detected on March 13 th 2020 presumably imported by travelers returning from Europe. Methods We performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Results Our phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain. Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20th. Identification of specific mutations showed rapid local genetic differentiation. Conclusions We evidenced early independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 that likely occurred before first cases were detected. Our analysis set the bases for future genomic epidemiology studies to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay and the Latin America and the Caribbean region.

Introduction:The outbreak of new coronavirus has become a global public health challenge. Given a consequential liver function, and the high risk of death coming from liver disorders, the assessment of Novel Coronavirus Disease on liver function is importance. Hence, we carried out this meta-analysis to heightening insight into the occult features of COVID 19, which is likely to affect liver function. Method:This study was performed using databases of Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. We considered English cross-sectional and case-series papers, which reported available findings on the association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection. We used the STATA v.11 and random effect model for data analysis. Result:In this present meta-analysis, 52 papers, including 8,463 COVID-19 patients, were studied. The prevalence of increased liver enzymes among the patients, including Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, were 30% and 21% in non-severe patients, respectively, which were 38% and 48% in severe patients. The prevalence of increasing C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and Bilirubin were 55%, 39%, 28%, and 10% in non-severe patients respectively, which were 78%, 75%, 79% and 17% in sever patients.The prevalence of liver toxicity as a complication of COVID-19 was 20%.Also patients who have severe condition are 5.54, 4.22, 4.96, 4.13 and 4.34 times more likely to have elevated CRP, ALT, AST, LDH, D-dimer enzymes retrospectively. Conclusion:Elevation of some liver markers were higher in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. All to gather, we assumed that abnormal liver markers could act as a prognostic factor for a better survey of COVID-19.

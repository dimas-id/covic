Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a single-stage restrictive bariatric procedure is becoming increasingly popular, especially in patients who are high risk and/or superobese. Between November 21, 2006, and September 30, 2008, 42 patients underwent LSG at our institution. Average age was 47 +/- 11 years, average body mass index was 54 +/- 10 kg/m2, and 62 per cent were female. Preoperative indications for LSG included contraindication to laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 11), severe coronary artery disease and/or congestive heart failure (n = 3), significant liver disease (n = 3), and patient preference (n = 4). Intraoperative indications for LSG included a foreshortened mesentery with inability to create a gastrojejunostomy (n = 13), extensive adhesions (n = 5), and intraoperative findings concerning for cirrhosis (n = 3). Twelve complications occurred in six patients: laparoscopic to open conversion (n = 1), reoperation (n = 3), nosocomial pneumonia (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1), bleeding (n = 1), pulmonary embolus (n = 1), readmission (n = 3), and superior splenic pole infarction. There was one death resulting from pulmonary embolism that occurred 2 weeks postoperatively. Preliminary excess body weight loss at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months was 29, 32 t, 38, and 30 per cent, respectively, and many patients had improvement or resolution of obesity-related comorbidities. Early review of our experience demonstrates that LSG may be an effective single-stage bariatric procedure. Additional follow up will be necessary to better define its long-term safety and efficacy.

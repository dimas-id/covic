Pediatric acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening, and devastating illness in children without preexisting liver disease. Due to the rarity and heterogeneity of this syndrome, there is a significant lack of data to guide evaluation and management of this disease. Most of our practice is extrapolated from adult literature and guidelines. This leads to significant controversies in medical management of acute liver failure in children. With advances in critical care, there has been a tremendous improvement in outcomes with decreased morbidity and mortality; however, there is a dire need for more research in this field. This chapter discusses challenges as well as controversies in diagnostic evaluation and management of this rare but potentially fatal disease. Latest developments in supportive care of liver failure, including advances in the area of liver support systems, are also discussed.

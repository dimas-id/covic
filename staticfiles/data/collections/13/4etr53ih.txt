Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Early detection of a viral etiology of a LRTI in a febrile transplant recipient can theoretically reduce the use of antibiotics, trigger modification of immunosuppression and prompt appropriate isolation procedures to reduce nosocomial infections. We retrospectively evaluated pediatric abdominal organ transplant recipients hospitalized with respiratory illnesses to determine the viral pathogens identified by various methods including multiplex RT‚ÄêPCR performed on nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates. Among 30 symptomatic subjects (median age, 2.5 yr) evaluated using this methodology, 25 (83%) were positive for at least one virus. Rhinovirus was the most frequently identified virus (14 subjects). RSV was identified in five subjects with associated mortality of 40%. Parainfluenza, influenza, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus were also identified. This study indicates that rhinovirus is a significant cause of morbidity in this single center cohort of pediatric abdominal organ transplant recipients.

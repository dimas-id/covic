Serology testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is increasingly being used during the current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate. Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences/cross-reactions, including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6 by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset. Overall agreements between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89). No cross-reaction with other endemic coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences/cross-reactions were low. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies.

The advent of “at will” production of biologics in lieu of harvesting animal proteins (i.e. insulin) or human cadaver proteins (i.e. growth hormone) has revolutionized the treatment of disease. While the fruits of the biotechnology revolution are widely acknowledged, the realization of the differences in the means of production and changes in the manner of control of potential impurities and contaminants in regard to the new versus the old are less widely appreciated. This chapter is an overview of the biologics revolution in terms of the rigors of manufacturing required to produce them, their mechanism of action, and caveats of endotoxin control. It is a continulation of the previous chapter that established a basic background knowledge of adaptive immune principles necessary to understand the mode of action of both disease causation and biologics therapeutic treatment via immune modulation.

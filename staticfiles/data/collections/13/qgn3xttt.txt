Fifty (13%) of 375 infants who weighed 1500 g or less at birth had necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Haematological changes suggestive of sepsis occurred in 83% and positive bacteriological cultures were found in 38%, the most common organism isolated being Clostridium perfringens. Complications included intestinal perforation in six patients and recurrence of NEC in five, of whom one subsequently developed an intestinal stricture. Five of the eight nursery deaths were secondary to peritonitis and overwhelming sepsis from NEC. In spite of the discontinuation of milk feeds for prolonged periods, satisfactory caloric intake and weight gain were achieved with parenteral nutrition in the survivors. Of the 41 long‐term survivors, six (15%) were found to have a disability at 2 years of ago, corrected for prematurity, compared with 48 (20%) of 241 very low birthweight survivors from the same study period who did not have NEC. None had evidence of gastrointestinal dysfunction. Six (15%) children remained below the 10th percentile for both weight and height. This study showed that early diagnosis and therapy for NEC in very tow birthweight infants were associated with a favourable short‐ and long‐term outcome.

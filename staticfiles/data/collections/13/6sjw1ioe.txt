INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common severe complications. There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19 in chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans; however, their availability to clinical staff in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) has yet to be explored. The purpose of this case report is to describe the natural course of the disease in mild infection managed at home. CASE REPORT We report a 35-year-old man with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection. Clinical examination was unremarkable. The diagnosis of mild disease was made clinically which was later reaffirmed by LUS after identifying a bilateral small pleural effusion and a thickened pleural line. During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever). The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home. CONCLUSION LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray. We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.

As a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread widely and claim lives worldwide, its transmission characteristics remain uncertain. Here, we present and analyze the serial intervals–the time period between the onset of symptoms in an index (infector) case and the onset of symptoms in a secondary (infectee) case–of 339 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified from 264 cities in mainland China prior to February 19, 2020. Here, we provide the complete dataset in both English and Chinese to support further COVID-19 research and modeling efforts.

BACKGROUND The BridgePoint system consists of the CrossBoss coronary catheter and Stingray CTO system (Boston Scientific) for coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs), and the Viance crossing catheter and Enteer re-entry system (Covidien) for peripheral CTOs. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature on the BridgePoint system published between October 2008 and August 2014, in accordance with the standards set forth in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS We identified a total of 20 studies: 12 studies on coronary CTOs (10 retrospective with 2 prospective case series) and 8 studies on peripheral CTOs (all retrospective). Among 320 patients undergoing coronary CTO intervention, pooled technical success and major adverse cardiac event rates were 77.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Among 175 patients undergoing peripheral CTO intervention, pooled technical success and major adverse events were 82.2% and 4.6%, respectively. Only 1 study reported long-term outcomes after use of the coronary BridgePoint system, demonstrating similar incidence of major adverse cardiac events between BridgePoint-treated and non-BridgePoint treated patients; however, the study had low power. CONCLUSIONS The BridgePoint system is associated with high procedural success rates and low complication rates when used for crossing both coronary and peripheral CTOs.

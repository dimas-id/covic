Blood plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses by secreting high levels of IFN-α following acute bacterial and viral infections and indirectly by augmenting cell-mediated immunity. Cross-sectional studies have shown that the number of circulating pDCs in HIV patients, compared to that in uninfected individuals, is reduced. However, since the time of infection is usually unknown in HIV-infected patients, pDC-virus interactions that occur immediately after virus exposure are poorly understood. The current study investigated pDC dynamics during acute and chronic infections of macaques with either SIVmac239 or the pathogenic SIV-HIV chimera, SHIV-89.6P, as models for HIV infection. In three rhesus and three pig-tailed macaques infected intravenously with SIVmac239, the percentages of pDCs in blood declined 2- to 6-fold during the first 6 weeks after infection and remained depressed throughout the disease course. Surprisingly, no consistent, comparable decline in peripheral blood pDCs was observed in six macaques infected with SHIV-89.6P. In this latter group, percentages of pDCs did not correlate with CD4(+) T cells, but there was an inverse relationship with viral load. In addition, when compared to naïve controls, the percentages of pDCs were reduced in spleens and peripheral lymph nodes of SIVmac239- but not SHIV-89.6P-infected animals that had progressed to AIDS. Proviral DNA was detected during the acute phase in pDCs isolated from macaques infected with either virus. These results imply that, even though macaque pDCs can be infected by both SIVmac239 and SHIV-89.6P, the subsequent effects on in vivo pathogenesis differ. The underlying mechanism(s) for these differences is unclear, but the selection of SIV or SHIV as a challenge virus might influence the outcome of some studies, such as those evaluating vaccines or the therapeutic efficacy of drugs.

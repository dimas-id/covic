Oocyte donation was originally established in 1983 as a treatment option for younger women with premature ovarian failure and for women with severe pelvic disease whose ovaries, as a result, were surgically inaccessible. The indications for donor oocyte in vitro fertilization (IVF) have now expanded to include not only women with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism but also those with advanced reproductive age, diminished ovarian reserve, significant genetic disease risk, poor oocyte or embryo quality, or multiple failures in prior attempts to conceive using conventional assisted reproductive technology (ART). Oocyte donation has also been recently used as an important source of material to promote the study of stem cell research. In these first cases of donation, gametes were obtained primarily from women already undergoing IVF who had excess oocytes at the time of retrieval. Today, most egg donors are not currently pursing infertility treatment themselves but are willing to donate their gametes for altruistic or commercial reasons. Since its initiation, oocyte donation services have spread throughout the USA and to many areas of the world. In the USA, 9,000â€“10,000 donor oocyte cycles occur annually. Though donor oocyte IVF is available throughout the USA, globally the practice of oocyte donation varies due to legal restrictions in many countries (Chap. 30).

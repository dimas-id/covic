Host factors render cells susceptible to viral infection. One family of susceptibility factors, the tetraspanin proteins, facilitate enveloped virus entry by promoting virus-cell membrane fusion. They also facilitate viral egress from infected cells. In this Gem, we discuss recent insights into how tetraspanins assemble viral entry and exit platforms on cell membranes, and we speculate that tetraspanins contribute to nonviral membrane fusions by similar mechanisms.

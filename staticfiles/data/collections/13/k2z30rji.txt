Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) is a rare form of thoracic outlet syndrome caused by axillosubclavian vein thrombosis which typically presents in healthy young adults. Prompt therapy, traditionally by means of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) prior to definitive surgery, can prevent the subsequent onset of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and considerable disability. As CDT is associated with major haemorrhage and high overall treatment cost, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) seems to be an attractive alternative which combines pharmacological thrombolysis with mechanical clot disruption. The Trellis-8 peripheral infusion catheter is an example of such a treatment which provides topical thrombolysis in an isolated zone. We describe the use of the Trellis-8 PMT system in the successful management of three patients with PSS.

Epidemiology of Covid‐19 and diffusion patterns of the novel coronavirus (SARS – CoV – 2) are still poorly understood, as they differ substantially among countries and even in neighboring regions within the same country. It is not clear if differences in viral spreading depends on population age, genetic influences, specific environmental factors (e.g. season of the year), socioeconomic conditions or a combination of these. Some Authors hypothesized that differences in models of SARS – CoV – 2 diffusion may be explained also on the basis of ethnic influences (Pareek, Bangash, Pareek, Pan, Sze, Minhas, Hanif, Khunti, 2020). Under such perspective, it seems rational to compare the Italian experience to that of Uruguay.

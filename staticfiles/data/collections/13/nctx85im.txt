Bilateral ophthalmic-ethmoidal dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are extremely rare and may present as complex lesions. These DAVFs are associated with high risk of intracranial hemorrhage but can be presented with ocular symptoms, cranial nerve palsy or epistaxis. Endovascular approaches have been used to manage an increasing proportion of complex intracranial DAVFs safely and with good clinical results. We present a patient with subdural hematoma and severe epistaxis due to ruptured bilateral ophthalmic-ethmoidal DAVF that was successfully treated by transarterial embolization with precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid.

Abstract It is known that certain feline cell lines, such as the Crandell-Rees feline kidney cell, produce an RD-114-like virus. As a feline endogenous retrovirus, RD114 virus, exists in the genome of all cats, it can be assumed that contamination with the virus in feline and canine live vaccines manufactured by culturing cells of feline origin occurs. To detect an infectious RD114 virus in vitro, a LacZ marker rescue assay has recently been established. In feline and canine live vaccines approved in Japan, feline cell lines are widely used to produce vaccines, especially those containing canine parvovirus components. The LacZ marker rescue assay detects infectious viral particles, but the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR detects both infectious and defective viruses. The canine live vaccines manufactured in cells of feline origin showed positive results for the env gene by the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR, including all of the 8 vaccines produced in feline cell lines that were negative in the LacZ marker rescue assay. In conclusion, the present investigation suggests that the newly developed method has the advantages of shorter time requirements and can be applied as a valuable screening method to detect RD114 viral RNA in vaccines.

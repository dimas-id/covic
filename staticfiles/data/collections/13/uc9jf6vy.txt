The streptococci are a large heterogeneous group of gram-positive spherically shaped bacteria widely distributed in nature. They include some of the most important agents of human disease as well as members of the normal human flora. Some streptococci have been associated mainly with disease in animals, while others have been domesticated and used for the culture of buttermilk, yogurt, and certain cheeses. Those known to cause human disease comprise two broad categories: First are the pyogenic streptococci, including the familiar Î²-hemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. These organisms are not generally part of the normal flora but cause acute, often severe, infections in normal hosts. Second are the more diverse enteric and oral streptococci, which are nearly always part of the normal flora and which are more frequently associated with opportunistic infections.

In this paper, the issue of tailoring the soft confusion matrix classifier to deal with imbalanced data is addressed. This is done by changing the definition of the soft neighbourhood of the classified object. The first approach is to change the neighbourhood to be more local by changing the Gaussian potential function approach to the nearest neighbour rule. The second one is to weight the instances that are included in the neighbourhood. The instances are weighted inversely proportional to the a priori class probability. The experimental results show that for one of the investigated base classifiers, the usage of the KNN neighbourhood significantly improves the classification results. What is more, the application of the weighting schema also offers a significant improvement.

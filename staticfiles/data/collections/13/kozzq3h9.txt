This chapter discusses tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) strains U1, OM, L, CGMMV, 0, and Cc. The production of each TMV protein is regulated differently, both in amounts and times of production. The chapter discusses some of the strategies that tobamoviruses uses to control gene expression: (1) different subgenomic RNA promoter/leader sequences control timing of expression of genes, (2) genes expressed via subgenomic mRNAs are expressed in decreasing amounts with increasing distances from the 3' terminus, and (3) TMV mRNAs appear to be translationally regulated differently from host mRNAs. Genome organization affects gene expression, but it appears to be equally important for the efficiency of replication and the ability of the genomic structure to be stably propagated. Different virus groups have evolved different gene arrangements. Tobamovirus genes expressed via subgenomic mRNAs appear to be expressed in increasing amounts when positioned nearer the 3â€™ terminus.

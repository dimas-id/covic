Abstract The health system is facing a global pandemic due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emergency plans often fail to consider specific rehabilitation issues, whether inpatient or outpatient, although the World Health Organisation advises the inclusion of rehabilitation professionals as soon as possible. The contingency plans of rehabilitation services must be carried out in coordination with the other healthcare areas. This review was prepared with the current available evidence on COVID-19 and was based on the experience of a specific environment, to plan the continuity of rehabilitation care for all patients and to help rehabilitation teams in this period of lockdown and uncertain lifting of restrictions.

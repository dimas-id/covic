Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury, known as atypical hemolytic syndrome (aHUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and shigatoxin-associated HUS (STEC-HUS) among others. Several diseases, like malignoma, infections, malignant hypertension, or autoimmune disease can result in secondary TMAs. aHUS is caused by a hyperactivated complement system. Identification of the underlying causes of the TMA is the most important issue and directly associated with treatment success. In case of secondary TMAs, treatment of the actual disease is the most important step, while in case of complement-mediated HUS treatment of choice is plasma exchange or anticomplement agents. For the treatment of TTP, rapid initiation of plasma exchange or plasma infusion is the treatment of choice. Patients with STEC-HUS should solely receive supportive treatment.

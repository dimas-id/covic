Data sources Self-developed survey. Data extraction and synthesis This was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered online survey. Results Out of 700 randomly selected dentists in Jordan, 368 completed an online survey. Of those, 36% reported that the incubation period for COVID-19 is 1-14 days. The majority were aware of the symptoms of the disease and can identify affected patients. Nonetheless, 36.7% of dentists did not believe it to be a serious public health issue. Conclusions This group of Jordanian dentists was generally aware of COVID-19 symptoms and mode of transmission. Clinical practice guidelines should be made available to dentists by their associations during such crises.

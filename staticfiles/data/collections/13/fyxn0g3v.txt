Abstract Viral genomes exhibit extraordinary diversity with respect to nucleic acid type, size, complexity, and the information transfer pathways they follow. Thus, viral nucleic acids can be DNA or RNA, double-stranded or single-stranded, monopartite or multipartite, linear or circular, as short as 2kb or up to 2500kb long. The goal of a virus is to replicate itself. To do so, viruses have evolved various strategies to replicate their genomes and produce the structural and catalytic proteins needed for the formation of new viruses. This article is a brief introduction to viral genomes and viral replication.

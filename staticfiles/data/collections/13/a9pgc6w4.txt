A pandemic of Coronavirus-19 disease was declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The pandemic is expected to place unprecedented demand on health service delivery. This position statement has been developed by the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand to assist clinicians to continue to deliver rapid and safe evaluation of patients presenting with suspected acute cardiac syndrome at this time. The position statement complements, and should be read in conjunction with, the National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand: Australian Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes 2016: Section 2 'Assessment of Possible Cardiac Chest Pain'.

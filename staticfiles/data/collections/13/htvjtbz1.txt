OBJECTIVE It is a major issue to diagnose and detect oropharyngeal dysphagia in the early stage of ALS in order to avoid pulmonary and nutritional complications. The aim of this study was to validate a simple clinical test, the Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test (V-VST), to detect oropharyngeal dysphagia in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty patients were included in this study (mean age: 66.1 ± 8.13, six women). All patients had their swallowing function assessed by videofluoroscopy and V-VST. RESULTS Among these 20 patients, 15 presented oropharyngeal dysphagia, diagnosed by videofluoroscopy, and five had normal swallowing. Norris score was lower in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia compared to the patients with normal swallowing (27 ± 6 versus 36 ± 2; P=0.003). Among the 15 patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, 14 had abnormal V-VST, and only one had normal V-VST. The sensibility of V-VST to detect oropharyngeal dysphagia in these patients with ALS was of 93%, and the specificity was of 80% (P=0.007). There was no significant difference between the two populations for ALSFRS score (22 ± 6 versus 20 ± 6) and body mass index (BMI) (26 ± 6 versus 26 ± 6 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSION The V-VST presented good sensibility and specificity. It may be interesting to use it systematically for the detection of oropharyngeal dysphagia in ALS, after confirming these results on a wider patient sample.

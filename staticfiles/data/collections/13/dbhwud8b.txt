Objectives: To investigate the etiology of viral respiratory tract infections mainly in hospitalized children and adults over a 12-month consecutive period after implementation of a 14-virus multiplex nucleic acid amplification test. Methods: From January 2014 to January 2015, a total of 2,237 respiratory samples were analyzed with the US Food and Drug Administrationâ€“cleared eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA). Results: Of the 2,237 specimens tested, 788 specimens were positive for at least one virus, giving a positivity rate of 35.2%, and because of viral codetection, a total of 862 viral targets were identified. The age groups with the highest positivity rates were the 0- to 1-year (73.5%) and 2- to 6-year (78.4%) age groups. The overall viral codetection rate was 9.1%. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most prevalent respiratory virus found in children and adults. The peak of HRV seen in September 2014 represented a combination of HRV and enterovirus D68, 2014 epidemic respiratory infections. Conclusion: The ability to detect a wider range of respiratory viruses gave us a better understanding of the etiology of respiratory infections in our population, particularly for HRV and enhanced our ability to detect viral coinfection.

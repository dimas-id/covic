BACKGROUND Plateau waves are common in traumatic brain injury. They constitute abrupt increases of intracranial pressure (ICP) above 40 mmHg associated with a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The aim of this study was to describe plateau waves characteristics with multimodal brain monitoring in head injured patients admitted in neurocritical care. METHODS Prospective observational study in 18 multiple trauma patients with head injury admitted to Neurocritical Care Unit of Hospital Sao Joao in Porto. Multimodal systemic and brain monitoring of primary variables [heart rate, arterial blood pressure, ICP, CPP, pulse amplitude, end tidal COâ‚‚, brain temperature, brain tissue oxygenation pressure, cerebral oximetry (CO) with transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy and cerebral blood flow (CBF)] and secondary variables related to cerebral compensatory reserve and cerebrovascular reactivity were supported by dedicated software ICM+ ( www.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/icmplus) . The compiled data were analyzed in patients who developed plateau waves. RESULTS In this study we identified 59 plateau waves that occurred in 44% of the patients (8/18). During plateau waves CBF, cerebrovascular resistance, CO, and brain tissue oxygenation decreased. The duration and magnitude of plateau waves were greater in patients with working cerebrovascular reactivity. After the end of plateau wave, a hyperemic response was recorded in 64% of cases with increase in CBF and brain oxygenation. The magnitude of hyperemia was associated with better autoregulation status and low oxygenation levels at baseline. CONCLUSIONS Multimodal brain monitoring facilitates identification and understanding of intrinsic vascular brain phenomenon, such as plateau waves, and may help the adequate management of acute head injury at bed side.

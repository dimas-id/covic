A Legionella cluster was identified through retrospective PCR analysis of 240 throat swab samples from X-ray-confirmed pneumonia cases. These were identified among young and otherwise healthy U.S. military recruits during population-based surveillance for pneumonia pathogens. Results were confirmed by sequence analysis. Cases clustered tightly, suggesting a local environmental etiology.

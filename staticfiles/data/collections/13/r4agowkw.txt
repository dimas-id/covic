BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is the most common prematurity complication. Although several practices have been proposed for BPD prevention, none of these in isolation prevent BPD. METHODS: Our initiative focused on two key drivers: oxygen management and noninvasive ventilation strategies. We created best practice guidelines and followed outcome measures using Shewhart control charts. RESULTS: PDSAs of protocols preceded a large-scale rollout of a “0.21 by 28” campaign in 2014 leading to a special cause reduction in the “any BPD” rate, and a decrease in severe BPD (from 57 to 29%). At the end of 2017, we reinvigorated the project, which led to dramatic decreases in the “any BPD” rate to 41% and the “severe BPD” rate to 21%. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary QI initiative focused on process improvement geared towards the pathophysiological contributors of BPD has successfully reduced the rate of BPD in an all referral level IV NICU.

A laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be technically challenging with co-existing portal hypertension, as commonly seen with cirrhosis of the liver. Extra hepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO) although less common, is a significant cause of portal hypertension in India. EHPVO has a unique clinical profile, which differentiates it from portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis of the liver. This impacts therapy in EHPVO algorithmically and operatively. We report two cases of symptomatic gall stones with portal cavernoma. Further evaluation revealed non-obstructive portal biliopathy. Both underwent a successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We highlight the importance of careful operative strategy, diligent haemostasis and the feasibility of performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic gall stones associated with a portal cavernoma.

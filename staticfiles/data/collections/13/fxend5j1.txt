Interleukin-35 is a potent suppressive cytokine of the IL-12 family. Although other members of the IL-12 family are produced mainly by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), IL-35 is produced by regulatory T (Treg) cells and suppresses cell proliferation. It has been shown to play an important role in many disease models and has been recently shown to have additional functions aside from inhibition of proliferation, including inducing its own expression in non-Treg cells. In this chapter, we discuss the history and current status of IL-35 biology, as well as suggest where the field might move in the future.

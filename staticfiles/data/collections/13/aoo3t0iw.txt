BACKGROUND The specific definition of central hepatectomy (CH) (i.e., resection of segments 4-5-8 Â± 1) is not uniformly used, resulting in conflicting comparisons with the more commonly performed extended hepatectomy (EH). The study aimed to compare, using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis, the incidence of postoperative complications between CH and EH for centrally located liver tumors (CLLT). METHODS All consecutive CH and EH procedures for CLLT performed from 1980 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Independent predictors of postoperative complications were identified. CH was compared to EH after PSM. RESULTS The study population consisted of 373 patients, 44 (11.8 %) of whom underwent CH and 329 (88.2 %) of whom underwent EH. Before PSM, the overall 90-day mortality was 7.2 % (27 patients) without a group difference (2 (4.5 %) for CH vs. 25 (7.6 %) for EH, p = 0.756). The CH and EH groups had similar postoperative morbidity rates (43.2 vs. 55.3 %; p = 0.108). Blood transfusion was the only independent predictor of postoperative complications (Hazard Ratio: 1.73; 95 % confidence interval: 1.11-2.68; p = 0.014). After PSM, 43 CH patients were matched with 43 EH patients. No group difference was observed for the postoperative mortality, morbidity, or duration of hospital stay. A higher number of EH patients (30.2 vs. 9.3 %, p = 0.028) presented with more than one postoperative complication. CONCLUSIONS CH and EH yield similar mortality and morbidity. For CLLT, CH may be an attractive procedure with the advantage of sparing the liver parenchyma compared with EH.

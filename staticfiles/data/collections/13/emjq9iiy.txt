Left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) and false aneurysm are complications of acute myocardial infarction, trauma, and cardiac surgery. Left ventricular false aneurysm (LVFA) is a particularly catastrophic complication owing to its high propensity for rupture. Surgical resection should be considered for LVFA occurring within three months after myocardial infarction or development of congestive heart failure. In this report, we describe a case of acute heart failure with LVA and LVFA occurring in stage as a complication of myocardial infarction in a 55-year-old man. The patient was also at risk of brain ischemia due to abnormal vessel status and a previous cerebrovascular accident with left-sided weakness. Successful perioperative anesthetic management was achieved by focusing on maintaining marginal upper normal blood pressure to ensure cerebral perfusion and to reduce the risk of false aneurysm rupture.

RATIONALE Tension band wiring is the most widely accepted technique for the treatment of patellar fractures but the technique is associated with common complications like wire migration, prominence, and breakage. To reduce these complications, we developed and propose a modified technique that has a superior biomechanical strength and a potential to reduce such postoperative complications. PATIENT CONCERNS The patient presented with pain and mild swelling in his left knee after he slipped on the floor and fell on his left knee. He has no significant past medical or surgical history. The patient took the tension band wiring as the first choice because of the wide acceptance. But he worried about the complications. DIAGNOSES X-ray showed a transverse fracture of the left patella with an inferior pole occult fracture. INTERVENTIONS The patient was operated with a modified technique of the classic tension band wiring for patellar fractures. In our 4-step procedure, double tension cerclage wires were wrapped under the exposed ends of the Kirschner wires (K-wires) and the tendons in figure-of-8 fashion. The aim was to increase the biomechanical strength so that when one of the tension wires fail, the other one can hold the fragments together. OUTCOMES The patient recovered very well and without any complications. The patient was followed-up for 1 year and the fracture has united very well, with satisfying knee range of motion. LESSONS From this case study, we can detect the biomechanical advantages of our technique which can increase the stability of the fracture and that allows early functional exercise and additionally the micromotion at the fracture site has a beneficial effect of fracture union. Based on the perfect outcomes, our technique is worthy of clinical application.

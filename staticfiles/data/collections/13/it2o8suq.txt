Pulmonary complications (PC) of hematologic malignancies and their treatments are common causes of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis is challenging due to host risk factors, clinical instability, and provider preference. Delayed diagnosis impairs targeted treatment and may contribute to poor outcomes. An integrated understanding of clinical risk and radiographic patterns informs a timely approach to diagnosis and treatment. There is little prospective evidence guiding optimal modality and timing of minimally invasive lung sampling; however, a low threshold for diagnostic bronchoscopy during the first 24 to 72 hours after presentation should be a guiding principle in high-risk patients.

We investigated if probiotic supplementation could improve the health and reproductive performance of unvaccinated lactating sows infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus. Twenty unvaccinated pregnant sows were equally allocated to probiotic‐supplemented (P) and control (C) groups. For the experiment, 15 g/day of probiotic compound BIO‐THREE PZ was given to P sows. Reproductive performance was checked daily. The number of neonates fostered by each sow was maintained at eight throughout the experiment. Individual milk production post‐parturition was measured twice. Milk protein and fat ratios were determined by a milk analyzer. Total immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G concentrations were measured by ELISA. At day 7 post‐parturition, the body weight of P sows was 10 kg higher than that of C sows, and at day 3 post‐parturition, P sows produced more milk (+2 kg) and had a higher IgA concentration in whey than did C sows (p < .05). Finally, unlike C sows, P sows tended to return to estrus faster, and had larger piglets at birth with a lower mortality percentage during early days of suckling. In conclusion, probiotic compound BIO‐THREE PZ helped strengthen the immune system of unvaccinated, PED‐infected sows and improved their reproductive performance.

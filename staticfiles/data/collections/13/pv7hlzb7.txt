BACKGROUND The optimal treatment for hyperacute stroke attributable to cervical internal carotid artery (C-ICA) occlusion remains controversial. OBJECTIVE This study sought to evaluate clinical outcomes and prognostic factors after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with hyperacute stroke within 6 hours of onset. METHODS Forty-seven patients with hyperacute stroke attributable to atherosclerotic C-ICA occlusion underwent emergent CAS. Forty-two patients (89.4%) had tandem intracranial artery occlusion (TIO). When patients showed remnant M1 or proximal M2 occlusions after CAS, intracranial recanalization therapy was performed by using pharmacologic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy with a Solitaire stent. Clinical and radiologic data were compared between patients with favorable (modified Rankin scale, 0-2) and unfavorable outcomes. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to find independent prognostic factors. RESULTS Emergent CAS was successful in all but 1 patient. Seven (16.7%) of 42 patients with TIO did not need further treatment, because thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia ≥2b was achieved immediately after CAS. Of the 35 patients who underwent intracranial recanalization therapy for remnant TIO, thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia ≥2b was achieved in 71.4% (25 of 35). Twenty-six patients (55.3%) had favorable outcomes, and mortality was 6.4% at 3 months. Time from symptom onset to carotid recanalization was inversely and independently associated with a favorable outcome for all patients and for those with TIO (P < .05). CONCLUSION In our patient group, emergent CAS for hyperacute stroke caused by atherosclerotic C-ICA occlusion seemed to be effective and safe. Time to carotid recanalization was inversely and independently associated with a favorable outcome.

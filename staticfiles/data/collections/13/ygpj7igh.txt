Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) in United States Medical Schools traditionally involve students interviewing and examining standardized patients (SP) in clinical skills labs. Our medical students complete 2-station OSCEs at the end of each clerkship. We suspended in-person curricular activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our dilemma: administer OSCEs upon return to in-person curriculum, release final grades without OSCEs, or convert to remote OSCEs.

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a serious illness that has affected thousands of people in the United States. Over 1,000 disease related deaths have occurred since its introduction to American soil in 1999. Spatial statistics are used to analyze distributional trends of human WNV cases from 2000 to 2008 through four analyses: Weighted Mean Center, Standard Deviational Ellipses, Global Moranâ€™s I, and Getis-Ord-Gi* statistic (hot spot analysis). We conclude that the directional trend in cases has been from East to West with the area affected increasing with time. Hot spot analysis reveals that recurring counties with a high number of human cases have been in the metro areas of large cities. However, normalized results indicate that the rate of humans showing symptoms of WNV is greatest in rural areas, particularly the Great Plains. These results provide a foundation for future research in analyzing the most persistent hot spots in more detail. Furthermore, these findings may aid decision makers in identifying areas to target for mitigation strategies such as spraying, larval control, and public awareness.

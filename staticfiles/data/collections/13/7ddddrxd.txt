This chapter provides an in depth study on the structure, composition, and organization of viral genomes, their classification into double stranded and single stranded DNA viruses, positive and negative stranded RNA viruses with and their genome diversity. Segmentation and re-assortment of viral genomes have been discussed along with the multipartite virus genomes. Genome details of 13 different viruses have been provided as type studies for better understanding of these topics. Concepts of viral genome evolution have also been discussed.

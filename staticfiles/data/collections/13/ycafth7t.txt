BACKGROUND A new technique in plastic surgery termed percutaneous radiofrequency dermaplasty (PRD) is described. Customized radiofrequency energy is applied via the percutaneous route to produce skin tightening and fascia contraction at body temperature, avoiding thermal injury. We combine PRD with lipoplasty and call this combined procedure dermaplasty-assisted lipoplasty (DAL). The purpose of this study was to review both the safety and efficacy of DAL. METHODS We developed the required novel device and technique to perform DAL and then performed a clinical trial including Type I and Type II lipodystrophy female patients undergoing a primary liposuction of the circumferential trunk. The trial comprised two phases. In Phase I, 51 patients were included in a prospective, comparative, controlled trial and divided into two groups. In Group 1, 29 patients underwent DAL, and in Group 2, 22 patients underwent a standard suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) alone. In Phase II, 84 patients underwent DAL, including 9 cases initially scheduled for a mini-abdominoplasty. RESULTS Phase I: We found better aesthetic results with DAL (93.1%) than with SAL alone (72.7%) [p < .05]. Postoperative correction of flaccid skin was superior with DAL (93.1%) than with SAL alone (36.4%) [p < .01]. Phase II: DAL achieved good-to-excellent aesthetic results in 94% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS DAL was found to be a reliable and safe treatment for fat removal with concomitant skin and fascia tightening but without compromising the viability of the overlying skin.

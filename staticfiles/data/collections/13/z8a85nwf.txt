Introduction: Thoracic surgery in children with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pulmonary disease is rare, as very limited virus-related lung lesions require intervention. However, some patients may suffer from other pulmonary abnormalities that can be worsened by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and they may consequently require lung surgery. COVID-19 affects the indications, surgical procedure, and postsurgical care of these patients. Background: We present a case of a 14-year-old girl with COVID-19 pulmonary disease and persistent air leak due to right apical bullae that required resection. Clinical, surgical, and safety implications are discussed. The role of thoracic minimally invasive surgery under COVID-19 conditions is also analyzed. Materials and Methods: The thoracoscopic procedure was scheduled earlier than normally expected. The surgery was performed in a COVID-19 reserved theatre with neutral pressure and only the necessary personnel was allowed inside. The use of the required personal protective equipment was supervised by an expert nurse before and after the intervention. Results: The surgeons used a three-port technique to resect the bullae with an endostapler and no mechanical pleural abrasion was added to the procedure. Electrocautery and CO2 insufflation were avoided, and a chest drain with a closed-circuit aspiration system was installed before removing the ports. The child was discharged home 3 days later after the removal of the chest drain. Conclusions: COVID-19 has an impact on the standard indications, surgical strategies and postoperative care of some conditions requiring intervention. Extra safety measures are needed in the operating room to limit the chance of transmission. Minimally invasive surgery for thoracic surgery remains safe if the current safety guidelines are followed closely.

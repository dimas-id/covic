Nowadays, nanomaterials [NPs; size, 1–100 nm] have emerged as unique antimicrobial agents. Specially, several classes of antimicrobial NPs and nanosized carriers for antibiotic delivery have proven their efficacy for handling infectious diseases, including antibiotic-resistant ones, in vitro as well as in animal models, which can offer better therapy than classical drugs due to their high surface area-to-volume ratio, resulting in appearance of new mechanical, chemical, electrical, optical, magnetic, electro-optical, and magneto-optical properties, unlike from their bulk properties. Thus, scientifically NPs have been validated to be fascinating in fighting bacteria. In this chapter, we will discuss precise properties of microorganisms and their modifications among each strain specifically. The toxicity mechanisms vary from one stain to another. Even the NP’s efficacy to treat against bacteria and drug-resistant bacteria and their defense mechanisms change according to strains in particular composition of cell walls, the enzymic composition, and so on. Thus, we provide an outlook on NPs in the microbial world and mechanism to overcome the drug resistance by tagging antibiotics in NPs and its future prospects for the scientific world.

Background: Parent-child interaction therapy is an early intervention for children with speech, language and communication difficulties. It involves training parents and caregivers on the importance of responsivity and language input in daily interactions and coaches them on strategies to implement this with the children. As the success of the intervention is heavily influenced by caregiver engagement, understanding and acceptance, it is important to consider their views. However, to date there has been limited work on synthesizing parental views of this intervention. Methods: This is a protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis of peer-reviewed papers addressing the experiences and perceptions of parent-child interaction therapy for parents of young children with communication difficulties. We will complete a systematic search of 11 databases, review the reference lists and complete a cited reference search of all included studies. Two authors will independently screen tests for inclusion, initially by title and abstract, with full-text screening as necessary. Thematic synthesis will be used for all included studies. We will appraise the quality of included studies using CASP and confidence in the review findings using GRADE CERQual. Discussion: The findings from this synthesis will help to guide best practice and policy for the implementation of parent child interaction therapy by considering the views of parents.

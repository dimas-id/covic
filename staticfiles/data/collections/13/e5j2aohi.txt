PURPOSE To evaluate the performance and safety of the Trellis-8 system, a pharmacomechanical thrombolysis infusion catheter, and adjunctive therapies in the treatment of symptomatic inferior vena cava (IVC) filter-related acute thrombotic occlusion. METHODS Eight consecutive patients (6 men; mean age 57.4 years, range 34-78 years) with acute thrombotic occlusion of the IVC in the presence of an IVC filter underwent percutaneous venous thrombectomy using the Trellis-8 thrombectomy system and adjunctive techniques between January 2009 and November 2013. Demographics, clinical data, procedures, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had clinical signs of lower extremity venous hypertension on presentation. The median time between IVC filter placement and occlusion was 25 months. Patients were followed for the development of thromboembolic complications to the last clinic visit or until they died. RESULTS The procedure was technically successful in 6 patients, whereas it could not be performed in 2 due to failure to cross the occlusion. The median follow-up period was 7.8 months, at which time all patients undergoing successful Trellis-8 thrombectomy had relief of symptoms without thromboembolic or bleeding complications. CONCLUSION In this limited performance and safety evaluation, the Trellis-8 thrombectomy system combined with adjunctive therapies, such as mechanical thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty, was effective in 75% of patients with IVC filter-related acute caval occlusion.

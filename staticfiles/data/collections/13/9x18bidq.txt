We previously demonstrated that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) could induce apoptosis through caspase signaling. However, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) on TGEV-induced apoptotic pathway. Results indicated that AIF translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during TGEV infection, and the AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (NP), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of AIF was inhibited by Veliparib (ABT-888), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). And the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC), redistributed AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in TGEV-infected cells. Moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mRNA levels of AIF were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, piﬁthrin-α (PFT-α) or in TGEV-infected p53−/−cells. Furthermore, TGEV-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, PDTC, PFT-α, to treat PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the p53- and ROS-mediated AIF pathway and caspase-dependent pathway were involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis.

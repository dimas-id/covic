Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) garnered scientific attention in early February following publication of reports showing in vitro activity of chloroquine (CQ) against COVID‐19. While studies are mixed on this topic, the therapeutic effect of HCQ or CQ still need more valid clinical evidence. In this descriptive observational study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of HCQ in COVID‐19 infected patients and 30 cases were included. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C‐reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) before and after HCQ therapy and clinical outcome in the 30 COVID‐19 patients were assessed. In order to evaluate the effect of mediation time point, we also divided these cases into two groups, patients began administrated with HCQ within 7 days hospital (defined as early delivery group) and 7 days after hospital (defined as later delivery group). We found that, the elevated IL‐6, a risk factor in severe patients were reduced to normal level after HCQ treatment. More importantly, patients treated with HCQ at the time of early hospital recovered faster than those who treated later or taken as second line choose for their obvious shorter hospitalization time. In summary, early use of HCQ was better than later use and the effect of IL‐6 and CRP level can not be ruled out. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

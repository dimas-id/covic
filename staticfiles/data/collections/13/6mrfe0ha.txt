Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is one of the most common pulmonary infections in persons with impaired cell-mediated immunity, and particularly those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).1–7 Pneumocystis was first described in the lungs of guinea pigs, during experiments on American trypanosomiasis by Carlos Chagas8 in 1909 and by Antonio Carinii9 in 1910. Both considered the cysts of Pneumocystis as part of the trypanosome’s life cycle. Shortly afterward the Delanoes10 found identical forms in the lungs of rats that had not been infected with trypanosomes and recognized the organism as a separate species. The name Pneumocystis carinii, was given to this organism as a generic name (Greek:pneumon, “lung”; kystis, “cyst”), honoring Carinii.11

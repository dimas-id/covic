The outcomes resulting from different prevention and control measures before and after 20 January, 2020 were compared.@*Results@#From 31 December, 2019 to 20 January, 2020, there were altogether 3 cases of definite COVID-19 infection and 2 ones of suspected COVID-19 infection at the department. One doctor, one technician and one nurse were diagnosed as definite COVID-19 infection while one nurse and one patient as suspected COVID-19 infection.

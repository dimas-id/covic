Genomics is the study of an organism’s entire genome. It started out as a great scientific endeavor in the 1990s which aimed to sequence the complete genomes of certain biological species. However viruses are not new to this field as complete viral genomes have routinely been sequenced since the past thirty years. The ‘genomic era’ has been said to have revolutionized biology. This knowledge of full genomes has created the field of functional genomics in today’s post-genomic era, which, is in most part concerned with the studies on the expression of the organism’s genome under different conditions. This article is an attempt to introduce its readers to the application of functional genomics to address and answer several complex biological issues in virus research.

Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor with a male predominance occurring mainly in children and young adults. The most common symptom is intermittent pain that worsens at night and is at least partially relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term effectiveness of computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation in patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Twenty patients with osteoid osteoma (15 men and 5 women) with a mean age of 20.7 years (range, 4-61 years; 12 patients aged 20 years or younger) underwent computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation. Lesion sites were the femur (n=9), tibia (n=7), pelvis (n=1), talus (n=1), cuneiform bone (n=1), and humerus (n=1). Mean follow-up was 44 months (range, 3-106 months). Pain relief was significant in 95% of patients; it disappeared within 24 hours in 14 patients, within 3 days in 4, and within 7 days in 1. The patient with persistent symptoms underwent another percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation procedure that was successful. The difference between pre- and postoperative pain was significant (P â‰¤ .01). No recurrences occurred. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous radiofrequency thermoablation is a safe, minimally invasive, and economical procedure with high technical and clinical success rates, and it effectively and durably enhances quality of life.

A man in his 40s was diagnosed with CML. He and his partner expressed their desire to have a child. We recommended planning the pregnancy after the achievement of major molecular response and completion of TKI therapy because we could not promise complete safety of the fetus, However, he and his partner insisted on starting the TKI therapy immediately and planned the pregnancy during the therapy. The patient was started on nilotinib 600mg/body. CCyR, MMR, and CMR were achieved in 3, 8, and 12 months, respectively. The patient's partner got pregnant when he had been on TKI therapy for 15 months, and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Since many patients with CMLcan live for a long time after receiving TKI therapy, the quality of life of these patients is more important. Even if the percentage of patients with CML who are under 50 years of age is approximately 30%, the safety information of TKI with respect to pregnancy is unsatisfactory. Doctors struggle to address the problems of the patient's wish of childbearing, priority of TKI therapy, and fetal risks of the treatment. Although only a few cases of pregnancy and delivery of the partners of male patients with CML treated with TKI have been reported, all cases showed healthy childbirth and normal child growth. Our experience also showed that the partner of a male patient with CML treated with TKI became pregnant and delivered a healthy baby.

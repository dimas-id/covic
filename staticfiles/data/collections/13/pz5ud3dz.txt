There is growing evidence that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a neurotropic and neuroinvasive potential. In particular, neurologic complications associated with the infection by SARS-CoV-2 include strokes that may result from a dysregulated inflammatory response to the infection. We report an atypical deep cerebral vein thrombosis complicated with hemorrhagic venous infarction in a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no risk factors for thrombosis.

The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire(â„¢) Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) is the first multiplex molecular panel cleared by the US FDA for the detection of both bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens in nasopharygeal swabs. The FilmArray RP targets 20 pathogens including 17 viruses and subtypes and three bacteria, and is performed with minimal sample manipulation. The FilmArray RP has a fully automated sample-to-answer workflow with a turn-around-time of approximately 1 h. The reported sensitivity and specificity of the assay ranges from 80 to 100 and 100%, respectively, with the sensitivity for the adenovirus as low as 46%. A new version of the FilmArray RP assay (version 1.7) with improved sensitivity for the adenovirus was released in 2013. The performance characteristics and simplified workflow have allowed its implementation in a wide range of laboratories. The FilmArray RP has changed the diagnostic landscape and will have a significant impact on the care of patients with respiratory tract infection.

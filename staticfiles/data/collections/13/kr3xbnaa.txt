Intubation and Positive End Expiratory Pressure Ventilation (PEEP) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function, particularly following blunt chest trauma. Complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non-invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) have only gained minor popularity. In a prospective study, 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with CPAP administered by mask. The regime consisted of continuous administration of CPAP by a face-mask, with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing. Initially a FiO(2) of 0.33 (range 0,28–0,38) proved necessary. The initial CPAP level was 7 mbar (range 5–8) with an (Assisted Spontaneous Breathing) ASB of 15 mbar (range 13–18). FiO(2) and CPAP/ASB levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary. In all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen. The treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur. In comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average ICU stay was dramatically reduced, principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation. Other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery, both physical and psychological. We conclude that non-invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications.

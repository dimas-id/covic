We commend Deepak and colleagues in highlighting the virtues of instant messaging tools such as WhatsApp during the COVID-19 crisis1 . Whilst WhatsApp's advantages include being highly intuitive, widely used and accessible, there are concerns among clinicians about its use, as well as that of other commercially available communications apps. These include the loss of anonymity to patients, the need to reveal their personal telephone number as well questions over privacy and data security.

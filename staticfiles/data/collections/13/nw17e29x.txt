The pathogenicity of three isolates of porcine respiratory coronavirus (AR310, LEPP and 1894) from the USA was assessed in specific pathogen-free pigs. Pigs inoculated with 1894 developed mild respiratory disease and pigs inoculated with AR310 and LEPP developed moderate respiratory disease from four to 10 days after they were inoculated, but all the pigs recovered fully by 14 days after inoculation. Gross and microscopic examination revealed mild (1894) to moderate (AR310 and LEPP) multifocal bronchointerstitial pneumonia from four to 10 days after inoculation. The lesions were characterised by necrotising bronchiolitis, septal infiltration with mononuclear cells, and a mixed alveolar exudate. No clinical signs or microscopic lesions were observed in control pigs that had not been inoculated.

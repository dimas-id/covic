Preservation of all or part the spleen is desired whenever oncologically acceptable and technically possible. Although a number of techniques for partial splenectomy have been described, the ideal approach remains elusive. We describe a novel technique in which the autologous falciform ligament was harvested, wrapped around the proposed splenic transection site, and secured with sutures to act as a buttress to a splenic transection staple line during a laparoscopic multivisceral resection for gastrocolic fistula secondary to locally advanced colon cancer. The spleen transection staple line was bloodless and the patient's recovery was uneventful. Our novel application of the falciform ligament to buttress the staple line at the time of spleen transection during partial splenectomy appears safe and warrants further assessment.

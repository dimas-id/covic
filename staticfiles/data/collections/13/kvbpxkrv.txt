In this commentary we discuss a downstream consequence of increases in stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress and anxiety can lead to mind wandering, which in turn competes for limited cognitive resources. We encourage researchers to be understanding and patient concerning the inevitable cognitive impact of the pandemic and subsequent reduced productivity levels from our students, colleagues, and ourselves.

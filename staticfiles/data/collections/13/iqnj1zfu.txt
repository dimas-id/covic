Surface architecting of the catalyst is a hopeful method to expand the surface property of the impetus material for upgrading their response towards the chemical reaction. In the present study, designing of the catalyst was carried out using specific transition metals to boost the simultaneous NO-CO conversion reaction catalytically. These metal oxide systems have been prepared using the combustion and wet impregnation method. Prepared oxides were characterized using XRD, BET, XPS, SEM, and TEM. Further, the surface phenomenon of the catalyst was monitored through H2-TPR, O2-TPO, NO-TPD, and CO-TPD studies. The highly remarkable activity was perceived by Pd-based modified manganese oxide-cobalt chromite system as compared with simple Pd-based manganese oxide and Pd-based cobalt chromite. The catalyst showed the highest activity for NO-CO redox reaction with T100 at 170 Â°C. Also, good stability was observed with a runtime of 7 h.

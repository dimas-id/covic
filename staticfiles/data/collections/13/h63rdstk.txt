INTRODUCTION Although several studies have compared totally robot-assisted gastric bypass (RA-GB) to laparoscopic gastric bypass (L-GB), the clinical benefit of the robotic approach remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared perioperative outcomes of 82 consecutive patients undergoing RA-GB between 2013 and 2016 to 169 consecutive patients having undergone L-GB between 2009 and 2016. Secondary endpoints included duration of hospitalization, readmission rate, weight loss at 1 year, and the learning curve of RA-GB, assessed by operation times and complication rates. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between groups concerning age (43.5 ± 11.2 vs. 42.2 ± 12.4 years), body mass index (42.4 ± 5.0 vs. 43.6 ± 7.2 kg/m2), or comorbidities. The rate of revision surgery was higher in L-GB group without reaching statistical significance. No statistically significant difference was observed for duration of operation (134 ± 35 vs. 135 ± 37 min), readmission rate at 90 days (4.9% vs. 8.9%), or percentage of excess weight loss at 1 year (RA-GB vs. L-GB) (76.8% ± 20.5 vs. 73.1% ± 23.5). There were fewer statistically significant complications overall in RA-GB (9.8% vs. 21.9%, p = 0.019). Median duration of hospital stay was shorter for RA-GB (3 vs. 4 days, p < 0.0001). The mean duration of operation for RA-GB decreased from 153 min in 2014 to 122 min in 2016; p = 0.004. CONCLUSION In our experience, the robotic approach for gastric bypass was associated with fewer postoperative complications compared to traditional laparoscopic gastric bypass. Cost increment associated with RA-GB remains an important drawback that hampers its widespread.

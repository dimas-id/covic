Abstract Objectives Given the high need and the absence of specific antivirals for treatment of COVID-19 (the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors are being considered as therapeutic alternatives. Methods Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800mg of the HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. Results DRV showed no activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 >100μM). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 =0.38μM). Conclusions Overall, the data do not support the use of DRV for treatment of COVID-19.

The experimental progress described in the previous chapter has been accompanied by an increasing desire to relate the complex three-dimensional (3D) shapes of biomolecules to their biological functions and interactions with other molecular systems. Structural biology, computational biology, genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, and others are natural partner disciplines in such endeavors.

Feline chronic gingivostomatitis is a frustrating disease to manage owing to its elusive etiopathogenesis and its subsequently suboptimal treatment options. Nevertheless, efforts to shed light on the disease over the past few decades have advanced the knowledge on its potential etiopathogenesis and the success rates of available treatment options. Further research is ongoing, with promising attempts to better understand and treat this, likely, multifactorial disease.

Toxoplasma gondii can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans. It can differentiate between rapidly replicating tachyzoites that cause acute infection and slowly growing bradyzoites in tissue cysts. Treatment options for toxoplasmosis are challenging because current therapies cannot eradicate the latent T. gondii infection that is mainly caused by the bradyzoite forms. Accordingly, recurrence of infection is a problem for immunocompromised patients and congenitally infected patients. Protein kinases have been widely studied in eukaryotic cells, and while little is known about signaling in Toxoplasma infection, it is likely that protein kinases play a key role in parasite proliferation, differentiation, and probably invasion. To identify optimized new kinase inhibitors for drug development against T. gondii, we screened a library of kinase inhibitor compounds for anti-Toxoplasma activity and host cell cytotoxicity. Pyrimethamine served as a positive control and 0.5% DMSO was used as a negative control. Among the 80 compounds screened, 6 compounds demonstrated â‰¥ 80% parasite growth inhibition at concentrations at which 5 compounds did not suppress host cell viability, while 3 kinase inhibitors (Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295 and PD-98059) had suppressive effects individually on parasite growth and host cell invasion, but did not strongly induce bradyzoite formation.

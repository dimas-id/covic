An agent-based approach is evaluated for its applicability as a new modeling technology in the emerging area of Computational Epidemiology, a research domain that attempts to synergistically unite the fields of Computer Science and Epidemiology. A primary concern of epidemiologists is investigating the spread of infectious diseases. Computer Scientists can provide powerful tools for epidemiologists to study such diseases. The existing simulation approaches available to epidemiologists are fast becoming obsolete, with data being stored in newer formats like GIS formats. There is an urgent need for developing computationally powerful, user-friendly tools that can be used by epidemiologists to study the dynamics of disease spread. We present a survey of the state-of-the-art in agent-based modeling and discuss the unique features of our chosen technique. Our agent-based approach effectively models the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases in spatially-delineated environments by using agents to model the interaction between people and pathogens. We present preliminary results of modeling an actual tuberculosis disease outbreak in a local shelter. This model is an important step in the development of user-friendly tools for epidemiologists.

Iodinated contrast media is frequently used in the OR, but often is not well understood by health care providers who are administering it. Although used for diagnosis rather than treatment, contrast media is classified as a drug by the FDA, and has indications, contraindications, adverse effects, drug interactions, disease interactions, and laboratory interference issues related to its use. Iodinated contrast media is classified according to osmolarity and ionicity, and these characteristics contribute to potential for adverse effects and choice of agent. Financial and safety concerns are factors to be considered when selecting an appropriate agent. Adverse effects can range from mild and self-limited to severe and life threatening; potentially the most serious of these are anaphylactoid reactions and contrast-induced acute renal failure. Knowledge of risk factors and preventive strategies is vital, as are issues related to substitution of gadolinium-based contrast, an off-label use. It is important for the perianesthesia nurse to become familiar with these commonly used imaging medications.

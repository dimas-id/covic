Antiretroviral therapy(ART)has been associated with reduced AIDS- and non-AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV/AIDS(PLWH). Nevertheless, the incidence of many comorbid conditions remains higher in PLWH than in the general population, including AIDS-defining malignancies(ADM)as well as several non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADM). It's important to prevent ADM/NADM, like periodic health checkup for early diagnosis, to quit smoking, and cooperation with cancer and HIV specialists.

OBJECTIVE To explore and analyze the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, management and maternal-perinatal prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-complicated pregnancy in second and third trimesters. METHODS Clinical data of 5 inpatients with SARS-complicated pregnancy in second and third trimesters from 4(th) February to 17(th) March 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Five patients were all primigravida (including 2 twins). Two were infected in second trimester while the other 3 in third trimester with 2 hospital-acquired infections and 3 community-acquired infections. All patients had fever (5/5), 3 chills or rigor, 4 cough; 2 with decreased lymphocyte, 2 decreased platelet, 3 elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 4 hypoalbuminemia, 5 abnormal chest radiographs. All 5 patients were cured with 1 requiring intensive care. 5 neonates including 1 twins have been followed up without evidence of SARS infections up to now. In a twin-pregnancy 1 fetus was lost while the pregnant's situation is stable. CONCLUSIONS Common diagnostic criteria were Suitable for SARS-complicated pregnancy in second and third trimesters, but attention should be paid to the interaction between SARS and special pathological changes during pregnancy. Patients should be isolated and monitored intensively with timely cesarean section in severe cases, which could significantly decrease the maternal-perinatal mortality. The use of corticosteroids and psychological supports need further study.

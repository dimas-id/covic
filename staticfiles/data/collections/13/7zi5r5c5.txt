The World Health Organization has announced the coronavirus infection pandemic (COVID-19), associated with a high risk of severe complications requiring intensive care. The following is a possible algorithm for the choice of treatment tactics for prostate cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at achieving 3 main goals: reducing the risk of life-threatening complications of the tumor process, minimizing the risk of “crossing” the profiles of adverse events associated with prostate cancer treatment and viral infection, and diminishing the risk of COVID-19 contamination for prostate cancer patients. The proposed algorithm is a personal view of the authors and is not an official recommendation.

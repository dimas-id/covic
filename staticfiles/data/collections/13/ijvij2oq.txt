BACKGROUND/AIMS The study aimed to clarify the risk factors for anastomotic leakage after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) for gastric cancer. METHODS In this study, we enrolled 131 patients with preoperatively diagnosed early gastric cancer who underwent LATG by a single surgeon between June 2006 and February 2014 at the Department of Surgery, Gastroenterological Center, Yokohama City University. Risk factors for anastomotic leakage (esophagojejunostomy) after LATG were retrospectively evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS Anastomotic leakage of the esophagojejunostomy was observed in 13 (9.9%) of 131 patients. Univariate analysis of risk factors for anastomotic leakage revealed that the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) is a risk factor for anastomotic leakage (<55, 11 of 63 vs. â‰¥55, 2 of 55; p = 0.039). Multivariate analysis revealed that PNI is an independent risk factor for anastomotic leakage (OR 0.208; 95% CI 0.044-0.981; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION Gastric cancer patients with a low PNI have a higher risk for anastomotic leakage after LATG. The results of this study must be confirmed by a study with a large cohort of patients receiving LATG reconstructed using the same method by experienced surgeons in multiple institutions.

OBJECTIVES to summarise and discuss current knowledge about COVID-19-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). METHOD literature review RESULTS: altogether 18 articles were found, which reported 23 patients with COVID-19-associated GBS. A further patient came to our attention by personal communication. Among these 24 included patients age ranged from 20 to 76y. There was male preponderance. Fourteen patients presented with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), 4 with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), 3 with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), and 2 with acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). In one patient the subtype was not specified. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was tested for SARS-CoV-2 in 15 patients but was negative for the virus in all of them. Seven patients required artificial ventilation. Twenty-one patients received intravenous immunoglobulines (IVIG). Thirteen patients recovered, 6 did not, and 2 patients died. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can cause GBS. SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS occurs in the absence of the virus in the CSF. Clinical presentation, course, response to treatment, and outcome do not vary between SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS and GBS due to other triggers. This article is protected by copyright.

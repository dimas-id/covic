The consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly affected dental practice. Since dental care is considered a high-risk activity (Volgenant et al., 2020), public and private dental clinics are closed to non-urgent cases in many countries. Several new routines and practices have been proposed to reduce this risk in dental offices, but standard dental treatment is expected to happen only after the "first wave" of disease and on an entirely new basis.

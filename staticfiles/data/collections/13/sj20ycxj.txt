BACKGROUND Ciprofloxacin dry powder for inhalation (Ciprofloxacin DPI) is in development as long-term intermittent therapy to reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) patients with respiratory bacterial pathogens. There is no approved therapy in this indication. Reliable, reproducible lung deposition is a prerequisite for inhaled drugs. METHODS In this phase I study, six patients with NCFB, six with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 12 healthy volunteers (HVs), received one dose of 99mTc-Ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg to assess pulmonary drug deposition by quantitative scintigraphy. 81mKrypton ventilation scans were performed to map lung contours. Systemic exposure as mediated by absorption in the lung was measured using the charcoal block method. HVs ingested activated charcoal orally (20 g before and 2 × 10 g after inhalation) to block gastrointestinal absorption of drug swallowed during inhalation. Indirect determination of pulmonary drug deposition was based on plasma and urine pharmacokinetic (PK) data. RESULTS Scintigraphic data revealed high, reproducible lung deposition in all participants (intrapulmonary deposition relative to nominal dose, mean [standard deviation; range]: NCFB, 53% [11%; 38%-64%]; COPD, 51% [10%; 34%-61%]; HVs, 51% [7%; 40%-64%] to 53% [8%; 44%-70%]). Similar ratios of central-to-peripheral airway deposition were seen across groups. Systemic exposure to ciprofloxacin was low. Relative bioavailability of Ciprofloxacin DPI was reduced by ∼60% after charcoal block, suggesting that systemic exposure was mainly caused by uptake via the lung. Lung deposition of 30% was estimated from PK data, but this may be an underestimation due to drug clearance from the lung and transintestinal secretion. Adverse events were no more frequent or severe in patients with lung diseases versus HVs, and no clinically relevant influence on vital signs or lung function was observed. CONCLUSION This study supports the continued development of Ciprofloxacin DPI in NCFB patients with respiratory bacterial pathogens.

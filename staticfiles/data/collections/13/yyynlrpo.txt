Today, sufficient consistent data are available to reinforce the interest of the use of Lactic Acic Bacteria (LAB), particularly lactococci and lactobacilli strains, to develop novel mucosal vaccination strategies. LAB are Gram positive bacteria exploited since the highest Antiquity by humans to produce fermented foods. They are thus good candidates to develop novel oral vectors and constitute attractive alternatives to vaccinal strategies based on attenuated pathogens which could induce healthy risks. Here, we summarized the most recent researches performed on the use of LAB as live vaccine delivery vectors.

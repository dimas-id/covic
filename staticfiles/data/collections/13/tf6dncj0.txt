Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system. Although a novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of SARS, the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS are not understood. In this study, sera were collected from healthy donors, patients with SARS, patients with severe SARS, and patients with SARS in convalescence. The serum concentrations of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor growth factor beta (TGF-beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The concentrations of IL-1 and TNF-alpha were not significantly different in different groups. The IL-6 concentration was increased in SARS patients and was significantly elevated in severe SARS patients, but the IL-6 concentrations were similar in convalescent patients and control subjects, suggesting that there was a positive relationship between the serum IL-6 concentration and SARS severity. The concentrations of IL-8 and TGF-beta were decreased in SARS patients and significantly reduced in severe SARS patients, but they were comparable in convalescent SARS patients and control subjects, suggesting that there was a negative relationship between the IL-8 and TGF-beta concentrations and SARS severity. The concentrations of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 showed significant changes only in convalescent SARS patients. The IFN-gamma and IL-4 levels were decreased, while the levels of IL-10 were increased, and the differences between convalescent SARS patients and other patient groups were statistically significant. These results suggest that there are different immunoregulatory events during and after SARS and may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

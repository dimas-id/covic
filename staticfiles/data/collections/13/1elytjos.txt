BACKGROUND: Siddha Medicine is a valuable therapeutic choice which is classically used for treating viral respiratory infections, this principle of medicine is proven to contain antiviral compounds. OBJECTIVE: The study is aimed to execute the In Silico computational studies of Phytoconstituents of Siddha Official Formulation Kabasura Kudineer and Novel Herbal Preparation - JACOM which are commonly used in treating viral fever and respiratory infectious diseases and could be affective against the ongoing pandemic novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2. METHOD: Cresset Flare software was used for Molecular Docking studies against the Spike Protein SARS-COV-2 (PDB ID: 6VSB). Further, we also conducted In Silico prediction studies on the pharmacokinetics (ADME) properties and the safety profile in order to identify the best drug candidates by using online pkCSM and SwissADME web servers. RESULTS: Totally 37 compounds were screened, of these 9 compounds showed high binding affinity against SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein. All the Phytoconstituents were free from carcinogenic and tumorigenic properties. Based on these, we proposed the new formulation called as “SNACK–V” CONCLUSION: Based on further experiments and clinical trials, these formulations could be used for effective treatment of COVID-19.

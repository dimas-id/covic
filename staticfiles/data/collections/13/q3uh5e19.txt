Digital enterprises and their networks increasingly rely on advanced decision-making capabilities, however, development of decision-making models requires significant effort and is often performed independently of other digitalization activities. Additionally, dynamic nature of many decision-making problems requires rapid ramp-up of decision-making capabilities. To addresses these challenges, this position paper proposes to elaborate a method for integrated on-demand decision modeling. The method combines mathematical programming and data analytics models to create case specific models on the basis of generic decision-making models. The integrated model and its data supply pipelines are configured using enterprise models allowing for consistent and rapid model deployment. The integrated model is intended for the trusted ICT supply chain configuration problem though it can be used for solving various types of decision-making problems. The main expected results are formulation of the new type decision-making model and the method for on-demand configuration of such models.

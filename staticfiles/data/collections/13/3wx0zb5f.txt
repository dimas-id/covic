INTRODUCTION Reduced neural drive is mainly thought to explain the bilateral deficit phenomenon, i.e. the difference in maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) between unilateral and bilateral contractions. The aim of the present study was to further document if bilateral knee extension is associated with changes in voluntary activation level assessed by both peripheral nerve electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. METHODS Fourteen subjects performed unilateral and bilateral knee extensions with both superimposed femoral electrical nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation in order to assess voluntary activation (VAFNES) and cortical voluntary activation (VATMS), respectively. RESULTS There was no difference in MVC force of the tested leg when involved in unilateral and bilateral knee extensions (p=0.87). However, a significantly reduced VAFNES (-2.1±2.4%; p=0.01) and VATMS (-1.6±2.7%; p=0.04) have been evidenced during bilateral knee extension. DISCUSSION It is hypothesized that counterbalances could have masked the decrease of voluntary activation during bilateral contraction.

PURPOSE The purpose of the study was to evaluate safety, time to recurrence, and overall survival (OS) in patients with liver metastases (LM), treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included all patients with LM treated with combined TACE and ablation from August 1998 to September 2015. Forty-two patients (12 women, 30 men; age 62.9 Â± 11.9 years) were treated for 44 LMs. Tumor characteristics, imaging response to treatment, recurrence, and OS data were reviewed. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox regression and Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon rank sum, or log rank tests. RESULTS Median follow-up was 10.3 months. Eighteen patients had 1 hepatic lesion, 16 had 2-5, and 8 had > 5. Median index lesion size was 4.7 cm (range 1.5-8 .0 cm). Tumor response (mRECIST) was available for 41/44 treated lesions, with CR in 32 (78.0%), PR in 8 (19.5%), and PD in 1 (2.4%). Long-term imaging follow-up was available for 38 patients. Freedom from local recurrence was 61% at 1 year and 50% at 2 years. OS was 55% at 1 year and 30% at 2 years (median OS, 14.5 months). Tumor size and histology were not predictors of time to progression or OS. Complications occurred in 19 patients (45%). Major complications occurred in 19% of patients and included hospitalization for fever (n = 2), hepatic abscess (n = 3) and fall requiring transfusion, portal vein thrombus causing lobar infarct, biliary fistula, and retroperitoneal hematoma (n = 1 each). CONCLUSIONS Combined TACE and ablation is effective for local tumor control of liver metastases up to 8 cm when part of a multidisciplinary treatment strategy. Major complications occurred in 19% of patients.

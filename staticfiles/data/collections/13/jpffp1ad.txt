Phytochemical investigation of the root of Baphicacanthus cusia (NEES) BREMEK afforded two new alkaloids, baphicacanthin A (1) and baphicacanthin B (2), along with 28 known compounds. The chemical structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of one and two dimensional (1D/2D)-NMR and high resolution (HR)-MS spectral evidence.

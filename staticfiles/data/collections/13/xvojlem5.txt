Abstract Severe COVID-19 causes significant numbers of patients to develop respiratory symptoms that require increasing interventions. Initially, the treatment for severe respiratory failure included early intubation and invasive ventilation, as this was deemed preferable to be more effective than Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). However, emerging evidence has shown that NIV may have a more significant and positive role than initially thought. NIV includes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP). CPAP is the method of choice with the use of BiPAP for those with complex respiratory conditions who contract COVID-19. The use of High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) remains contentious with different perspectives in how this modality can be used to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. Current thinking suggests that NIV and HFNO may be an appropriate bridging adjunct in the early part of the disease progress and may prevent the need for intubation or invasive ventilation. Patients requiring NIV or HFNO may be nursed in locations outside of the critical care unit. Therefore, this article reviews the different types of NIV and HFNO, indications and the nursing care.

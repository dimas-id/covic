Background: No studies have reported comparisons of mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Objectives were to compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including continuous change scores, proportion with change [≥] 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and factors associated with changes, including country. Methods: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change [≥] 1 MCID. Findings: Among 435 participants (Canada = 98; France = 159; United Kingdom = 50; United States = 128), mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France, adjusted scores from the United States and United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.9) and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were not significantly different. Odds of increasing by [≥] 1 MCID were twice as high for the United Kingdom (2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.2) and United States (1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Participants who used mental health services pre-COVID had adjusted increases 3.7 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.7) less than other participants. Interpretation: Anxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition. Increase was larger in the United Kingdom and United States than in Canada and France but substantially less for people with pre-COVID-19 mental health treatment.

Abstract Traditional infectious diseases models on metapopulation networks focus on direct transportations (e.g., direct flights), ignoring the effect of indirect transportations. Based on global aviation network, we turn the problem of indirect flights into a question of second neighbors, and propose a susceptible-infectious-susceptible model to study disease transmission on a connected metapopulation network coupled with its second-neighbor network (SNN). We calculate the basic reproduction number, which is independent of human mobility, and we prove the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria of the model. Furthermore, the study shows that the behavior that all travelers travel along the SNN may hinder the spread of disease if the SNN is not connected. However, the behavior that individuals travel along the metapopulation network coupled with its SNN contributes to the spread of disease. Thus for an emerging infectious disease, if the real network and its SNN keep the same connectivity, indirect transportations may be a potential threat and need to be controlled. Our work can be generalized to high-speed train and rail networks, which may further promote other research on metapopulation networks.

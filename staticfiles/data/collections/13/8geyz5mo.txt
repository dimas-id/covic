Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key component in diagnostic medical imaging, including echocardiography. AI with deep learning has already been used with automated view labeling, measurements, and interpretation. As the development and use of AI in echocardiography increase, potential concerns may be raised by cardiac sonographers and the profession. This report, from a sonographer's perspective, focuses on defining AI, the basics of the technology, identifying some current applications of AI, and how the use of AI may improve patient care in the future.

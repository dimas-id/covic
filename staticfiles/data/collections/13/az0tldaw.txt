PURPOSE Cryopreservation of a complete ovary may be a future method for fertility preservation in cancer patients. Difficulties exist in cryopreservation of the relatively large ovarian tissue mass. This study evaluates whether a human postmenopausal ovary can be used, as a complement to animal models, in studies of this research field. METHODS Postmenopausal human ovaries (n = 10) were isolated and flushed through ovarian arteries with either the cryoprotectant dimethylsulphoxide or Ringer-Acetate, followed by slow freezing. After thawing, production of androgens during in vitro perfusion and morphology (light/electron microscopy) were assessed. RESULTS The dimethylsulphoxide-cryopreserved ovaries showed larger secretion of androgens during perfusion than Ringer Acetate-cryopreserved ovaries. Light microscopy showed well preserved morphology in both groups. Electron microscopy revealed normal appearance of stroma and vessels in the dimethylsulphoxide group. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrates the potential to use the postmenopausal human ovary for further studies aiming at optimizing cryopreservation protocols, with special reference to ovarian vascularity and stroma.

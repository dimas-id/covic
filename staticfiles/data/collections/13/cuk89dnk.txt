PURPOSE: To propose a cost-effective reproducible barrier method to safely perform endoscopic endonasal surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This manuscript highlights the use of a clear, cost-effective disposable plastic sheet that is draped as a tent over the operating area to contain aerolization of particles. This is then connected to a suction to remove airborne particles and thus reduce transmission of the virus. CONCLUSION: The use of a nasal tent is a simple and affordable method to limit particle spread during high-risk aerolisation procedures during the Covid era and beyond.

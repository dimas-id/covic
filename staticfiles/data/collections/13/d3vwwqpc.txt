We aim to investigate whether the phenomenon of "sudden drop" in blood pressure (BP) within the first 2 hours is associated with vessel recanalization.We retrospectively examined clinical and imaging data from a consecutive series of patients with stroke with large vessel occlusion treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). BP was monitored every 15 minutes during the first 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, and then every hour for 16 hours.We observed the phenomenon of "sudden drop" in systolic BP (â‰¥20 mm Hg) in 82 (50.9%) patients in the first 2 hours and vessel recanalization in 87 (54.0%) patients 24 hours after treatment. This phenomenon was independently associated with recanalization (odds ratio 2.100; 95% confidence interval: 1.085-4.062; P = 0.028) after adjusting for the history of atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, and hypertension.The phenomenon of "sudden drop" in systolic BP with 20 mm Hg or greater between 2 continuous measurements within the first 2 hours is associated with recanalization after IVT in patients with large vessel occlusion, especially for middle cerebral artery occlusion.

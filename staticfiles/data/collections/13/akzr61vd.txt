This paper presents a new derivative parsing algorithm for parsing expression grammars; this new algorithm is both simpler and faster than the existing parsing expression derivative algorithm presented by Moss [12]. This new algorithm improves on the worst-case space and runtime bounds of the previous algorithm by a linear factor, as well as decreasing runtime by about half in practice.

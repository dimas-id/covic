Abstract In the scientific literature, a small amount of information is found concerning mycoplasmosis in camel species. A variety of pathogens could be causative agents for pneumonia, but walking pneumonia is mostly caused by Mycoplasma with slow development and mild symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify mycoplasmas from camels (Camelus dromedarius) and extending the arsenal of factors implicated in pathogenicity of M. arginini to shed light on the current knowledge gap. 460 lung samples (pneumonic; n=210 and apparently healthy; n=250) were randomly collected from the one-humped camels (C. domedarius) that have been imported from Sudan and slaughtered at Cairo Slaughterhouse. 48 out of 210 isolates (22.9%) recovered from the pneumonic lungs were recorded as M. arginini. Positive PCR results were obtained for all 48 isolates. On the other hand, infection with the organism was not detected in the apparently healthy lungs. Hemolysis and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) production, a compound that has previously not been identified as a virulence factor in M. arginini, was evident in 100% of the isolates. The 48 M. arginini isolates were weak in their ability to form biofilm on polystyrene surfaces. All isolates were 100% susceptible to florfenicol and streptomycin and 100% resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to lincomycin, spiromycin, tylosin, doxacyclin and erythromycin was observed at different frequencies. 13 different combinations of antibiotics representing one to four classes were evident with the Macrolide erythromycin being the most represented. It also should be noted that the ciprofloxacin, doxacyclin, lincomycin, erythromycin combination was the most noted in 21/48 isolates. Surprisingly, none of the virulence genes (vsp, uvrC and gapA) and quinolone resistance genes (parC and gyrA) were detected by PCR.

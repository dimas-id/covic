ABSTRACT Much evidence supports the notion that angiotensin II (Ang II), the central product of the reninâ€“angiotensin system (RAS), may play a central role not only in the etiology of hypertension but also in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases in humans. Ang II, via the Ang II type 1 receptor, directly causes cellular phenotypic changes and cell growth, regulates the gene expression of various bioactive substances, and activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, as well as vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Recently, new factors have been discovered, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-(1-7), and its receptor Mas. This section summarizes the current knowledge about the broad RAS in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, heart failure, vascular thickening, and atherosclerosis.

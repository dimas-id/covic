Data sources Narrative reviewStudy abstract This review provides a synopsis of our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated coronavirus disease, COVID-19. The virus is shed in the nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of carriers, and this puts dental professionals at risk for increased exposure of SARS-CoV-2. The paper summarises the current guidelines outlined by the CDC and presents the triaging protocols to identify potential carriers and how to safely limit treatment to low-risk patients.

PURPOSE: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has fully engaged and played an essential role in the prevention and treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study compares relevant standards on high-frequent Chinese Materia Medicia (CMM) used in this pandemic aiming at reaching a global consensus and ensuring the use of Chinese medicines safely. METHODS: 141 representative Chinese formulas and Chinese Patent Medicines from the National Protocol and the most of Provincial Protocols for controlling COVID-19 in China have been collected to statistical analyze the composition and characteristics of CMM. Among them, the domestic and international standards of 47 varieties with the frequency usage over 10 times were selected to compare their quality requirements in the mainstream pharmacopeias and international standards. RESULTS: The quality requirements of used CMM for fighting COVID-19 on the terms of overall quality control, marker compounds, and safety indicators showed different patterns in these mainstream pharmacopoeias and international standards. The uniformed and scientific quality standards of CMM were urgently needed to promote global acceptation and trade. CONCLUSIONS: These findings will provide evidence for building unified quality and safety standards that can adapt to the characteristics of CMM and promote international trade, and also will be stated that it is of the highest priority for ISO/TC 249 to formulate high-quality standards that consolidate international consensus to ensure quality and safety of the urgently needed CMM.

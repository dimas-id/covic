Martín Carreras‐Presas et al. (2020) reported a case in May in Oral Diseases that they suggested was the first case report describing of a COVID‐19 patient with oral manifestations including oral pain, desquamative gingivitis, ulcers and blisters. Galván Casas et al. (2020) provided a description in April in the British Journal of Dermatology of the cutaneous manifestations of COVID‐19 in an impressive 375 case series, and with that, they had documented for the first time the oral manifestations of the disease. The report includes an atlas of these manifestations as a downloadable supplement that includes apparently 150 different cases and among those, two cases with intra‐oral manifestations that vary from ulcers in the palatal mucosa, to localized erythema in the palate and the margins of gingiva.

Abstract Objectives: We examined the serum levels of interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), an inflammation-induced chemokine, in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Design and methods: The subjects were 33 AMI patients, 20 stable angina pectoris patients (AP) and 20 normal subjects. In AMI patients, blood samples were collected before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and on days 3, 7 and 28. Results: Patients with AMI showed significantly higher serum IP-10 levels (137.5±79.8 pg/mL) than control subjects (91.2±40.1 pg/mL) and patients with AP (93.3±41.1 pg/mL). The serum IP-10 level before PCI was negatively correlated with infarct size, as indicated by cumulative release of creatine kinase (CK) and peak CK and its isoenzyme CK-MB. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the serum IP-10 level before PCI was an independent predictor of cumulative CK release. Conclusions: The serum IP-10 level was increased in AMI, and a higher level of serum IP-10 before PCI may be informative regarding infarct size.

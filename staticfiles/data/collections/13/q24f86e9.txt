Proteins are important biomolecules, extensively involved in almost all biological processes. A number of proteins are also implicated in infectious diseases. Bacterial proteins used in adhesion to host epithelium, bacterial toxins, and viral membrane glycoproteins are some of the proteins involved in infectious diseases. Even components of the host innate immune system like Toll-like receptors and Nod-like receptors and adaptive immune components like immunoglobulins aiding in defense against pathogens are important biological proteins. Chaperones like acid and heat shock proteins provide protection from high temperatures, metabolic poisons, and other stressful conditions. Several natural and artificial proteins are components of vaccines, a key strategy to control fatal diseases, lacking empirical treatment. It is necessary to investigate these proteins, to develop new biomedical tools and technologies, aiding in eradication of various diseases. Thus, further research should be carried out in this field, for saving and improving quality of human lives.

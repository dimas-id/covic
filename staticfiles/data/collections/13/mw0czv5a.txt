The Upper Bunter palynological assemblage described includes 54 species, assigned to 29 genera. Seven genera (Scabratisporites, Guttatisporites, Lapposisporites, Pseudogravisporites, Paralundbladispora, Taeniaepollenites and Tubantiapollenites) and 39 species are new; three generic descriptions are emended (Apiculatasporites, Colpectopollis and Angustisulcites) and three new combinations are proposed. Bisaccate pollen grains average 84 %; within this group no Upper Permian elements could be demonstrated. The assemblage is compared with other European Lower and Middle Triassic assemblages; there are no close similarities to assemblages outside Europe.

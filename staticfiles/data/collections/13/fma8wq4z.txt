Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is the causative pathogen for MERS that is characterized by high fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as extrapulmonary manifestations. Currently, there are no approved treatment regimens or vaccines for MERS. Here, we generated recombinant nonvirulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota strain expressing MERS-CoV S protein (designated as rLa-MERS-S), and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and Bactrian camels. The results revealed that rLa-MERS-S showed similar growth properties to those of LaSota in embryonated chicken eggs, while animal immunization studies showed that rLa-MERS-S induced MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice and camels. Our findings suggest that recombinant rLa-MERS-S may be a potential MERS-CoV veterinary vaccine candidate for camels and other animals affected by MERS.

Abstract Purpose This study investigated the feasibility and efficacy of continuous noninvasive ventilation (NIV) support with 100% oxygen using a specially designed face mask, for reducing desaturation during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB)-guided intubation in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Materials and methods This was a single-center prospective randomized study. All patients undergoing FOB-guided nasal tracheal intubation were randomized to bag-valve-mask ventilation or NIV for preoxygenation followed by intubation. The NIV group were intubated through a sealed hole in a specially designed face mask during continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen. Control patients were intubated with removal of the mask and no ventilatory support. Results We enrolled 106 patients, including 53 in each group. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) after preoxygenation (99% (96%–100%) vs. 96% (90%–99%), p = .001) and minimum SpO2 during intubation (95% (87%–100%) vs. 83% (74%–91%), p < .01) were both significantly higher in the NIV compared with the control group. Severe hypoxemic events (SpO2 < 80%) occurred less frequently in the NIV group than in controls (7.4% vs. 37.7%, respectively; p < .01). Conclusions Continuous NIV support during FOB-guided nasal intubation can prevent severe desaturation during intubation in critically ill patients with respiratory failure.

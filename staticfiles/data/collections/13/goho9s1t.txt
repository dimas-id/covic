PURPOSE Dislocation of the mesh is 1 cause of recurrence after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). Here, we propose a new procedure, the "preperitoneal cavity suction technique," to confirm mesh position during LIHR under a transabdominal preperitoneal approach (TAPP). PATIENTS AND METHODS We developed the "preperitoneal cavity suction technique" during LIHR by TAPP, visualizing the mesh through the closed peritoneum by vacuuming up the carbon dioxide and effusion at the preperitoneal cavity using a suction tube inserted through the tunnel from a laterally placed trocar into the preperitoneal space. We applied this technique in adults with inguinal hernias who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery in our hospital between April 2013 and March 2015. RESULTS In total, 84 lesions were treated in 74 consecutive LIHRs by TAPP. The "preperitoneal cavity suction technique" was applied to 83 lesions. We confirmed appropriate positioning of the mesh for 82 of the 83 lesions (98.8%), with dislocation of the mesh detected in 1 case. In that case, we reopened the peritoneal flap and repositioned the mesh correctly during the operation. No patients complained of pain or a sense of discomfort, and no hematoma was identified around the dissected area or anterior superior iliac spine on the affected side. Mean duration of hospitalization was 2.5 days. No cases of hernia recurrence were observed during follow-up (range, 7 to 31 mo; median, 15 mo). CONCLUSIONS The "preperitoneal suction technique" seems useful to detect mesh dislocation and has potential to reduce TAPP-related complications.

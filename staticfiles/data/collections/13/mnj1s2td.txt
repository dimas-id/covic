Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious threat to the lives and health of our people, but there is currently no clear target for therapeutic drugs. Therefore, prevention is of great significance for the prevention and control of COVID-19. The Health Management Administration of the different provinces and cities have successively released the “Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment Programs for New Coronavirus Pneumonia” in response to the epidemic situation, among them including preventive prescriptions, which showed the theoretical characteristics of “treating disease before its onset” of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and also showed the characteristics of medication in different provinces. Therefore, we collected 66 formulas for treating COVID-19 in China and studied the rules of TCM prevention in various provinces and autonomous regions, and unified the thinking of medication, which could provide a reference for the prevention of COVID-19a.

The CLEARSY Safety Platform (CSSP) is aimed at easing the development and the deployment of safety critical applications, up to the safety integrity level 4 (SIL4). It relies on the smart integration of the B formal method, redundant code generation and compilation, and a hardware platform that ensures a safe execution of the software. This paper exposes the programming model of the CSSP used to develop control & command applications based on digital I/Os.

Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is associated with many kinds of diseases including postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). It affects the immune system of swine and causes huge epidemic losses every year. In our previous study, we provided evidence that DNA plasmid bearing porcine IL-15 (pVAX-pIL-15) might serve as an immune enhancer for DNA plasmid encoding porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus GP5 gene. In this study, PCV2 open reading frame (ORF)2 gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX, resulting in the plasmid pVAX-PCV2-ORF2. Transient expression of the plasmid in BHK-21 cells could be detected using immunofluorescence assay. Experimental mice were divided into 5 groups and immunized with PBS, pVAX, pVAX-pIL-15, pVAX-PCV2-ORF2 or pVAX-pIL-15 plus pVAX-PCV2-ORF2. The results showed that the mice co-inoculated with pVAX-PCV2-ORF2 plus pVAX-pIL-15 had higher humoral and cellular immune responses than the others. In addition, DNA plasmid bearing PCV2 ORF2 gene had a protective effect against challenge with PCV2 in mice which could be promoted with the utilization of pIL-15.

BACKGROUND The drawback of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy with the double-stapling technique (DST) using a transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) following laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is not only the high incidence of stenosis but also the presence of intractable stenosis that is refractory to endoscopic treatments. METHODS From November 2013 to December 2016, 24 patients with gastric cancer underwent intracorporeal circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-double-stapling technique (hemi-DST) using the OrVil™ in antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the left side of the patient following LTG to prevent twisting of the esophagojejunostomy and lifted jejunum, which might cause intractable stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy. RESULTS In this patient series, no twisting of the esophagojejunostomy and lifted jejunum was encountered intraoperatively or postoperatively. Two stenoses of the esophagojejunostomy occurred. Because neither was involved with twisting and both were localized at the anastomotic plane, endoscopic treatments including balloon dilation and electrocautery incisional therapy were successful in both cases. There were no patients with intractable stenosis in this series. CONCLUSIONS Intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-DST using the OrVil™ in antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the left side of the patient can be one option for a circular stapling technique in LTG due to its prevention of intractable stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy that is refractory to endoscopic treatments.

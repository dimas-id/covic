RATIONALE It has been reported that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may affect myocardial autonomic function. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between EAT and cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS In 110 patients with systolic heart failure, we evaluated the correlation between echocardiographic EAT thickness and cardiac adrenergic nerve activity assessed by (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG). The predictive value of EAT thickness on cardiac sympathetic denervation ((123)I-MIBG early and late heart:mediastinum ratio and single-photon emission computed tomography total defect score) was tested in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, catecholamine levels, catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, and sympathetic nerve fibers were measured in EAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies obtained from patients with heart failure who underwent cardiac surgery. EAT thickness correlated with (123)I-MIBG early and late heart:mediastinum ratio and single-photon emission computed tomography total defect score, but not with left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, EAT resulted as an independent predictor of (123)I-MIBG early and late heart:mediastinum ratio and single-photon emission computed tomography total defect score and showed a significant additive predictive value on (123)I-MIBG planar and single-photon emission computed tomography results over demographic and clinical data. Although no differences were found in sympathetic innervation between EAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue, EAT showed an enhanced adrenergic activity demonstrated by the increased catecholamine levels and expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the first evidence of a direct correlation between increased EAT thickness and cardiac sympathetic denervation in heart failure.

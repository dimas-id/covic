BACKGROUND Chronic constipation may be categorized as normal transit (NTC), slow transit (STC), or outlet obstruction. Colonic wake response is a relative increase in colonic motility upon awakening. Colonic manometry studies have demonstrated attenuated wake response in STC. We sought to evaluate wake response among healthy (H), NTC, and STC patients using wireless motility capsule (WMC). METHODS A retrospective study of WMC data from a multicenter clinical trial and a tertiary gastroenterology clinic was performed. WMC motility parameters of contraction frequency (Ct) and area under the contraction curve (AUC) were analyzed in 20-min windows 1-h before and after awakening. T-tests compared parameters between H, NTC, and STC. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine if outlet obstruction confounded data. A receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated optimal Ct cut-offs to define blunted wake response. RESULTS A total of 62 H, 53 NTC and 75 STC subjects were analyzed. At 20, 40, and 60 min after awakening, STC subjects had significantly lower mean Ct when compared to H (p < 0.001) and NTC (p < 0.01). Linear regression demonstrated that outlet obstruction was not associated with a decreased wake response (Î² = 3.94, (CI -3.12-1.00), P = 0.27). Defined at the Ct threshold of 64 at 20-min post-wake, blunted wake response sensitivity was 84% and specificity was 32% for chronic constipation. CONCLUSION Findings of an impaired wake response in subjects with STC and not NTC adds further evidence to neuronal dysfunction as an etiology of STC, and identifies a possible temporal target for pharmacologic intervention.

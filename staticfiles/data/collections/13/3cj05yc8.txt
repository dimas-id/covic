INTRODUCTION: In the context of the stage 3 SARS-Cov-2 epidemic situation, it is necessary to put forward a method of rapid response for an HAS position statement in order to answer to the requests from the French Ministry of Solidarity and Health, healthcare professionals and/or health system users' associations, concerning post-natal follow-up for women and neonates during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A simplified 7-step process that favours HAS collaboration with experts (healthcare professionals, health system users' associations, scientific societies etc.), the restrictive selection of available evidence and the use of digital means of communication. A short and specific dissemination format, which can be quickly updated in view of the changes in available data has been chosen.

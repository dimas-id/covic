Twelve pregnant sows were inoculated oral-nasally 8 weeks before farrowing with attenuated transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), tissue culture-adapted canine coronavirus (CCV), or fluids from mock-infected culture (controls). A 2nd dose of the same inoculum, one-half oral-nasally and one-half intramammarily, was given 6 weeks later. Neutralizing antibodies for TGEV and CCV were demonstrated in sera, colostrum, and milk whey from the virus-vaccinated sows. Homologous geometric mean neutralizing titers were generally 4-fold higher than were heterologous titers. After challenge exposure of the nursing pigs with virulent TGEV, average morbidity and mortality for the pigs were 81% and 34% (mortality range = 11% to 63%), respectively, in the TGEV-vaccinated group; 83% and 39% (mortality range = 15% to 83%), respectively, in the CCV-vaccinated group; and 97% and 84% (mortality range = 78% to 100%), respectively, in the controls. Seemingly, sera from swine exposed to CCV could test serologically positive for TGEV-neutralizing antibody, and TGEV and CCV share at least 1 common neutralizing determinant that may be involved in protection.

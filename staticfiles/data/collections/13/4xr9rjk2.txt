First isolated in China in early 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease has been spreading rapidly across the globe, with the largest burden falling on China, Europe, and the United States. COVID-19 is a new clinical syndrome, characterized by respiratory symptoms with varying degrees of severity, from mild upper respiratory illness to severe interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, aggravated by thrombosis in the pulmonary microcirculation. Three main phases of disease progression have been proposed for COVID-19: an early infection phase, a pulmonary phase, and a hyperinflammation phase. Although current understanding of COVID-19 treatment is mainly derived from small uncontrolled trials that are affected by a number of biases, strong background noise, and a litany of confounding factors, emerging awareness suggests that drugs currently used to treat COVID-19 (antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, immunomodulators, anticoagulants, and antibodies) should be evaluated in relation to the pathophysiology of disease progression. Drawing upon the dramatic experiences taking place in Italy and around the world, here we review the changes in the evolution of the disease and focus on current treatment uncertainties and promising new therapies.

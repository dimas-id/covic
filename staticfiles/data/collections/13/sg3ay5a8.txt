Clinical microbiologists have a new and unique opportunity to increase our value to health care by broadening how we think about disease processes and asking ourselves what we can do to help resolve a disease, assist in tracking a cause, or even predict an outbreak before it occurs. Human health, animal health (both wildlife and domestic animals), and environmental health are forever bound together. The convergence of people, animals, and the environment defines the parameters of One Health and directs attention to the impact this overlap has on public health, disease detection, and control. One Health (sometimes referred to as One Medicine) is a concept that promotes, improves, and defends the health and well-being of all species through the integration of the sciences of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental studies. As microbiologists, we need to be aware of this One Health concept and how it can positively impact our profession by allowing us to be more productive members of the health care team. There are several things we can do to get started. We can review organism pathogenicity and evaluate and question test results that may signal an unusual event or process that led to a disease. We can be alert to the epidemiologic potential of organism isolates from patients as they may apply to infection control or community epidemiology. We can become familiar with the zoonotic diseases and recognize the etiologic agents associated with wild and domestic animals and apply that knowledge to our diagnostic skills. As we further understand the “big picture” of One Health, we can ask strategic questions that can lead us to provide further technical assistance to facilitate earlier interventions that lead to positive patient outcomes and ultimately healthier populations. In human medicine, we generally work with one species of animal. Veterinarians work with all the rest. It is time to communicate with and learn from our veterinary clinical microbiology colleagues and begin to understand the critical nature of the human, animal, and environment interface. This is our opportunity to be at the front of this line and not stand on the sidelines watching.

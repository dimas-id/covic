The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a massive toll on health care systems globally. We developed the COVID-19 virtual clinic (CVC) in conjunction with drive through testing to cope with this situation. There are two arms of the CVC: (1) a screening arm and (2) positive patient arm. Screening is performed over the phone based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guideline. Positive patients are followed at regular intervals by video appointments where concerns can be addressed by a provider while also tracking symptom progression. We enrolled 63 positive patients out of 1,153 screened for COVID-19 as of this writing. The CVC continues to address patients' concerns and symptoms in an effort to minimize emergency department and hospital patient volumes, as incidence increases. Drive through testing in conjunction with a virtual clinic allows us to provide high-quality care in an anxious time without consuming excessive personal protective equipment or unnecessarily exposing health care workers. This article could serve as a model to guide other practices to cope with this and future pandemics.

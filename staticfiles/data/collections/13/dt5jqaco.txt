The number of cases of the coronavirus-induced disease-2019 (COVID-19) continues to increase exponentially worldwide. In this crisis situation, the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is challenging. In this review, we outline the risk and benefits of primary PCI vs. thrombolysis for STEMI. While thrombolysis may seem like a good choice, many patients have a contraindication and could end-up using more resources. Also, with a high probability of the angiogram showing non-obstructed coronary arteries during acute infections, primary PCI should be the preferred strategy.

The complete genome sequence of a variant of porcine deltacoronavirus, isolated from a diarrheal piglet and designated CH/JXJGS01/2016, was sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that CH/JXJGS01/2016 shares the highest nucleotide and amino acid identities with the Chinese strain NH (GenBank accession number KU981059).

Establishing fever clinic was an important achievement of the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and played an important role in the subsequent outbreaks of H1N1, H7N9 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Fever clinics have significant emergency characteristics, but there are no rescue conditions in the fever clinics. Consequently, the problem of establishment and management of fever clinics is still outstanding. Based on the development of fever clinics, this paper analyzes the operational dilemma of fever clinics, explores the measures of establishment and management of fever clinics, and constructs the operational mechanism of fever clinics in order to provide the basis for the emergency management system of public health emergencies, which is suitable for Chinese health system.

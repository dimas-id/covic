Serological evaluation with SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody will be an alternative way to know the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) if the capacity for diagnostic PCR test is limited. The point-of-care test to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in peripheral blood (n =202) was performed in two community clinics in Tokyo, Japan. The overall positive rate of SRAS-CoV-2 IgG antibody was 5.9% (95% confidence interval[CI]: 3.1-10.1). Higher rate was observed for healthcare workers (n =55, 9.1 [3.0-20.0]). The limitation on antibody tests includes low sensitivity and potent cross-reactivity with the previous coronavirus. Robust healthcare policy to efficiently monitor COVID-19 spread is warranted in Tokyo.

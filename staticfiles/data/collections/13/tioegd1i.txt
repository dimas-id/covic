Radical cystectomy is considered the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The use of minimally invasive techniques, particularly robot-assisted radical cystectomy, is steadily increasing with an acceptable learning curve, adequate lymph node yield, and acceptable perioperative complications. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to confirm oncologic efficacy, but early data are encouraging. While the majority of urinary diversions are performed extracorporeally, several recent small case studies have reported successful totally intracorporeal diversions, including both ileal conduit and orthotopic neobladder creation. Operative and short-term clinical outcomes have thus far been comparable to those of previously reported extracorporeal techniques. As surgeons gain experience with the robotic techniques needed for radical cystectomy, the frequency of intracorporeal urinary diversions will similarly increase. In this article, we describe the stepwise surgical procedure and perioperative management of the robot-assisted laparoscopic intracorporeal ileal conduit.

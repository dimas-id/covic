The beginning of 2020 was characterized by the development of a new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Information about the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory diagnostics, as well as prevention and therapy for this disease is constantly being expanded and reviewed. The COVID-19 pandemic creates the need for the emergence of new conditions of specialized care for patients with heart rhythm and conduction disorders [1]. These recommendations are intended for general practitioners, internists, cardiologists, electrophysiologists/arrhythmologists, cardiovascular surgeons, functional diagnostics doctors, anesthesiologists-resuscitators, laboratory diagnostics specialists, health care organizers in the system of organizations and healthcare institutions that provide specialized care to patients with heart rhythm and conduction disorders.

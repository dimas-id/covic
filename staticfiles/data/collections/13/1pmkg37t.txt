Group A Beta Hemolytic Streptococci (GAS) is the most critical human pathogen that leads to tonsillopharyngitis. The aims of this study were to identify GAS isolates and to determine emm typing, the coverage rate of available vaccines, and the distribution of superantigen gene profiles. 15 GAS isolates were isolated from throat cultures of 200 patients with tonsillopharyngitis, who were admitted to Canakkale Health Application and Research Hospital between October 2017 and May 2018. Identification of the isolates was performed by conventional methods and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. emm typing and exotoxin profiling of the isolates were performed by polymerase chain reaction. 7.5% GAS was detected in 200 patients. All the GAS isolates were identified as S. pyogenes. emm typing can be carried out in 13 S. pyogenes isolates. emm89 (33.3%), emm44 (20%), emm6 (13.3%), emm84 (6.7%), emm1 (6.7%), and emm18.1 (6.7%) were found to be six emm types. The coverage rate of S. pyogenes strains for 26-valent vaccine was 61.5% and for the 30-valent vaccine 84.6%. The most common exotoxin was speB (86.7%), followed by speC (60%), speF (33.3%), ssa (26.7%), speA (20%), speM (20%), speJ (13.3%), speL (6.7%), and speI (6.7%). As a result of determining the emm types of S. pyogenes species in Canakkale, it was concluded that the potential of 30-valent vaccine should be considered in Turkey and development of vaccines containing exotoxin types may be beneficial.

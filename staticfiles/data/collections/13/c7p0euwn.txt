We read the editorial by Dr. Brodin with great interest, which is discussing why COVID-19 appears to be so mild in children(1). The author discussed the potential theories that could explain why children have a lower incidence and milder clinical manifestations than adults. Additionally to the theories mentioned by the author; we would like to emphasize the differences between the child and adult respiratory systems that potentially protect children from severe COVID-19 disease.

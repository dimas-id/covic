Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most problematic pathogens in clinical settings. Emerging of its antibiotic-resistant strains persuade researchers to find alternative treatment options such as immunization against the notorious nosocomial pathogen. Oma87 has been introduced as an immunogenic outer membrane protein via reverse vaccinology. However, protectivity of A. baumannii Oma87 is not well known. The current research undertakes a study on the immunogenicity of recombinant Oma87 in a murine model. Some physico-chemical properties were assessed via in silico analyses. The corresponding gene was amplified and cloned into pET28a plasmid. The recombinant protein was purified and then was administered to immunize mice. Sera obtained from the immunized mice were assessed with respect to the triggered antibodies. Challenges were performed on actively or passively immunized mice. In silico analyses revealed that this protein is the same as BamA. A high titer of specific antibody was raised against rOma87 even after the first injection. The specific antibody recognized the whole cell of A. baumannii. Both active and passive immunizations confer 100 and 50% protection, respectively against ~ 2 × lethal dose (LD) of A. baumannii in the murine sepsis model. Although none of mice received ~ 5 × LD of A. baumannii survived in passive immunization, 25% of mice challenged with ~ 7 × LD of the bacteria survived and the dead mice exhibited a delayed death. Based on these results, Oma87 is the same as BamA which could be considered as a promising vaccine candidate against A. baumannii in the sepsis model.

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children carries a high morbidity and mortality. High frequency ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are used as rescue modes of support in difficult situations. Malignancy may be considered to be a relative contraindication to ECMO support. We report a case where the decision was made to support the patient with ECMO for fulminant Epstein-Barr (EBV) infection while investigations were being done to exclude an underlying malignancy.

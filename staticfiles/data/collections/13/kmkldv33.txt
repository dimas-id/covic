Abstract Previous investigations have revealed that in vivo use of diethylcarbamazine (N,N-diethyl-4-methyl-1-piperazine carboxamide; DEC), the mainstay of prevention and therapy for filariases, results in increased titers of antibody to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) in feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected cats.In the present study, the effect of in vitro DEC on detection of serum antibodies to retroviruses was investigated. The addition of DEC (5 mg ml−1, pH 7·3–7·4) to the serum diluent resulted in detection of antibody to FOCMA by indirect membrane immunofluorescence in five of five FeLV-infected cats, whereas samples from all five cats tested negative without the addition of DEC. In vitro DEC also increased the absorbance values generated by enzyme immunoassay human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibody testing of samples from (a) persons with AIDS-related disease; (b) persons with helper T-lymphocytes < 500 mm−3 blood; and (c) persons testing positive for antibody to HIV-1 env- but not gag-related antigens as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( RIP-SDS PAGE ). We conclude that in vitro as well as in vivo use of DEC may alter results of antibody testing for retroviruses.

BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a variant of laparoscopic surgery, especially for diverticular disease (DD), but there are very little data comparing SILS to standard surgical procedures for DD, and most studies on DD surgery do not declare the disease stage. We compared SILS to open sigmoidectomy for DD in a stage-stratified matched-pair analysis to validate the significance of SILS. METHODS All patients with SILS or conventional sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis of a single visceral surgery department were subject to a matched-pair analysis stratified by age, sex, body mass index, previous abdominal surgery, and the stage of DD. RESULTS Fifty-five pairs were included. In total, 84/110 (76%) had complicated stages of DD. ASA stages were higher in the laparotomy group; the proportion of elective operations was similar (SILS 78%, open: 71%). In the SILS group, length of hospital stay (LoS; 10.2 vs. 16.7 days) and duration of intensive or intermediate care (IMC; 1.8 vs. 3.7 days) were shorter, blood transfusions were reduced (0.1 vs. 0.4 units) and less patients received opioids postoperatively (75 vs. 98%). The day of first defecation, stoma rate, and rates of morbidity and mortality were similar. CONCLUSIONS SILS equals open sigmoidectomy regarding complications with advantages regarding pain, LoS, IMC/intensive care unit treatment, and blood transfusion.

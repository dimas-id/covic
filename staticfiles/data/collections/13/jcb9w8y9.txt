Abstract Lelystad virus (LV), the prototype of porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus, is a small enveloped virus, containing a positive strand RNA genome of 15 kb. LV is tentatively classified in the family Arteriviridae, which consists of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). These viruses have a similar genome organization and replication strategy as coronaviruses, but the size of the genome is much smaller (12–15 kb) and they have different morphological and physicochemical properties. The genome of LV contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b), envelope proteins (ORFs 2 to 6) and the nucleocapsid protein (ORF7). Genomic comparison of European and North American isolates has shown that the structural proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 vary widely. The amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 of North American strains share only 55 to 79% identical amino acids with those of European strains. Using polyvalent porcine anti-LV serum, gene-specific anti-peptide sera and monoclonal antibodies, we have identified six structural proteins of LV and their corresponding genes. These are: the 15 kDa unglycosylated nucleocapsid protein (N) encoded by ORF7, an 18 kDa unglycosylated integral membrane protein M encoded by ORF6, a 25 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF5, a 31–35 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF4, a 45–50 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF3 and a 29–30 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF2. A nomenclature for these structural proteins is proposed.

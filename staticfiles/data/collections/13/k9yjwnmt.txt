Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) is a hantavirus that causes a disease in humans known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hallmarks of hantaviral infections are increased vascular permeability due to dysregulation of the endothelial cell barrier and acute thrombocytopenia. In order to gain insight into the immune response in DOBV infections, the serum levels of 27 cytokines in 24 hospitalized Greek HFRS patients were evaluated. Compared to the control group, significantly higher IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, GM-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1b, TNF-α and VEGF levels were found in severe cases, while in non-severe cases, IL-13 and TNF-α levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05). In all groups, IP-10 was increased and RANTES was decreased. Significant and time- (after onset of illness) dependent differences among fatal, severe and non-severe cases were seen. VEGF was positively associated with disease severity. A strong immune response was seen during the first week of illness, especially in severe cases, while the response in non-severe cases was weaker and delayed. The Th1 response was strong in non-severe cases and weak in the fatal case, while a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response was seen in the survivors of severe disease.

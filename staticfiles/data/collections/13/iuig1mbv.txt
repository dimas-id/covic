A virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain, DR13, was obtained from suckling pigs suspected of having porcine epidemic diarrhea in 1999 in Korea, and its attenuated counterpart was derived from virulent strain DR13 by serial propagation in Vero cells. This report describes the first complete genome sequences of virulent PEDV and its attenuated counterpart, which will provide important insights into the molecular basis of the attenuation of PEDV.

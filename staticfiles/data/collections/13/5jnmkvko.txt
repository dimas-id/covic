A 73-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and no known malignancies was evaluated for back pain. MR examination showed lumbar spine compression fractures, and an (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan was requested to assess for skeletal metastatic disease and potential detection of a primary neoplasm. The PET/CT examination revealed scattered FDG-avid pulmonary opacities with upper lobe preponderance highly suspicious for COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed the diagnosis.

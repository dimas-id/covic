The use of balloon guide catheters in acute ischemic stroke intervention has been associated with improved reperfusion rates and clinical outcomes. This technique acts by promoting flow arrest and subsequent reversal to capture the thrombus debris that may be generated during the clot retrieval process. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of BGC to remotely aspirate and remove intracranial thrombus has not been previously described. We report a three case series of patients with acute ischemic stroke from supraclinoidal internal carotid artery occlusions treated with remote aspiration thrombectomy through a BGC placed at the cervical internal carotid artery, leading to complete reperfusion without the need for intracranial catheterization. Remote thrombectomy in the setting of intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion may constitute a relatively fast and inexpensive initial thrombectomy maneuver. Further investigation is warranted.

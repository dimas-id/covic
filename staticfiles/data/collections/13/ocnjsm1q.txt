Failure of distinction between self and non-self is regarded a critical event in the pathogenesis of several human diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, uveoretinitis or diabetes mellitus. Autoagressive immune reactions driven by activated autoreactive lymphocytes are a characteristic feature of these autoimmune diseases. The mechanisms by which the pathogenic control of autoreactive lymphocytes deviates from physiology can be studied in appropriate animal models under well-defined experimental conditions. Experimental models of autoimmune diseases in rodent inbred strains allow for the genetic mapping of susceptibility loci and might help to identify candidate genes also relevant to the pathogenesis of human diseases. Finally, the experimental models are valuable tools to develop rational immunotherapeutic strategies. Interesting features of some of the models employed for such research will be introduced in this review.

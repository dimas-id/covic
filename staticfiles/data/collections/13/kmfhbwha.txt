In the present study, we investigated the association between susceptible genetic variants to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to as-needed intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) therapy for exudative AMD including both typical neovascular AMD and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) over 12-months. A total of 234 patients with exudative AMD were initially treated with 3 monthly IAI and thereafter as-needed IAI over 12 months. Seven variants of 6 genes including ARMS2 A69S (rs10490924), CFH (I62V:rs800292 and rs1329428), C2-CFB-SKIV2L(rs429608), C3 (rs2241394), CETP (rs3764261) and ADAMTS-9 (rs6795735) were genotyped for all participants using TaqMan technology. After adjusting for age, gender, baseline BCVA and AMD subtype, A (protective) allele of C2-CFB-SKIV2L rs429608 was associated with visual improvement at 12-month (P = 0.003). Retreatment was associated with T(risk) allele of ARMS2 A69S (P = 2.0 × 10-4; hazard ratio: 2.18:95%CI: 1.47-3.24) and C(risk) allele of CFH rs1329428 (P = 2.0 × 10-3; hazard ratio: 1.74:95%CI: 1.16-2.59) after adjusting for the baseline confounders. The need for additional injections was also associated with T allele of ARMS2 A69S (P = 1.0 × 10-5) and C allele of CFH rs1329428 (P = 3.0 × 10-3) after adjusting for the baseline confounders. The variants of ARMS2 and CFH are informative for both physicians and patients to predict recurrence and to quantify the need for additional injections.

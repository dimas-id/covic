The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐Co‐V‐2) has resulted in a critical need to rapidly develop new pharmacologic interventions and disseminate information. This has led to confusing and conflicting information on drug efficacy. Remdesivir has emerged as a promising treatment for SARS‐Co‐V‐2 infection yet published clinical pharmacology and drug interaction studies are limited. Additional studies of the disposition of remdesivir, its active metabolite (GS‐441524), and its triphosphate metabolite (GS‐443902) are needed.

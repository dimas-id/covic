Birth asphyxia accounts for nearly one million deaths worldwide each year, and is one of the primary causes of early neonatal morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of the current neonatal resuscitation guidelines remain controversial given the difficulties in conducting randomized clinical trials owing to the infrequent and often unpredictable need for extensive resuscitation. Most studies on neonatal resuscitation stem from manikin models that fail to truly reflect physiologic changes or piglet models that have cleared their lung fluid and that have completed the transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. The present protocol provides a detailed step-by-step description on how to create a perinatal asphyxiated fetal lamb model. The proposed model has a transitioning circulation and fluid-filled lungs, which mimics human newborns following delivery, and is, therefore, an excellent animal model to study newborn physiology. An important limitation to lamb experiments is the higher associated cost.

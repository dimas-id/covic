We present a fractional-order model for the COVID-19 transmission with Caputoâ€“Fabrizio derivative Using the homotopy analysis transform method (HATM), which combines the method of homotopy analysis and Laplace transform, we solve the problem and give approximate solution in convergent series We prove the existence of a unique solution and the stability of the iteration approach by using fixed point theory We also present numerical results to simulate virus transmission and compare the results with those of the Caputo derivative

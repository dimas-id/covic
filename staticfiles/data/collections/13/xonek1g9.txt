During a thirty-month study of gastroenteritis in North West London, 592 cases were found to be associated with excretion of viruses. 39 (6Â·6%) of these patients, most of whom were admitted to hospital because of gastroenteritis, were shedding caliciviruses. The cases occurred throughout the year with a peak incidence in the winter. The 39 patients ranged in age from 6 weeks to 13 years, the peak incidence beig among infants aged 1-6 months. The clinical features of calcivirus infection are not distinguishable from those of rotavirus infection.

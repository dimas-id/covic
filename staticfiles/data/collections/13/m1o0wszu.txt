Patients with cancer are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, which contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. The rapid progress in the field of oncological treatments has led to a steady increase in long-term cancer survivors. Care for cardiovascular complications is therefore becoming increasingly important. In addition, the establishment of new oncological therapies has resulted in the identification of previously unknown cardiovascular side effects. Oncocardiology aims to detect and treat cardiovascular diseases associated with cancer and cancer therapy. Continuous scientific, clinical, and structural developments are necessary as the basis for the best care of the growing number of affected patients. This review summarizes current developments in the field of oncocardiology with regard to advances in cancer therapy and challenges in clinical oncocardiology work. Cardiovascular side effects by targeted cancer therapies are characterized and recent advances in the field of cardiovascular diagnostics are outlined. Developments to better integrate oncocardiology into the medical care system and perspectives for modern, patient-oriented care are shown. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted. The relevance of profitable further advances in oncocardiology including standardized guidelines and educational programs is delineated as a mandatory requirement for the successful development of oncocardiology.

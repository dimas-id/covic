Abstract Symptom management and skilled communication with patients and families are essential clinical services in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While palliative care specialists have training in these skills, many front-line clinicians from other specialties do not. It is imperative that all clinicians responding to the COVID-19 crisis have access to clinical tools to support symptom management and difficult patient and family communication.

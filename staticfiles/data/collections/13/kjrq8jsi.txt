This study describes an outbreak of avian poxvirus disease in previously pox-vaccinated turkeys in Brazil. The turkeys had suggestive gross lesions of cutaneous avian poxvirus in the skin of the head and cervical area without changes in the flock mortality rates. In the slaughterhouse, 30 carcasses were removed from the slaughter line to collect tissue from cutaneous lesions for histological analyses and characterization of the virus. The virus was identified by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent gene sequencing. Acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and hydropic degeneration were seen on skin histopathology. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger) on keratinocytes were observed in 46.6% of the samples. Avian poxvirus DNA was detected on PCR in 83.3% of the total samples. PCR associated with histopathology had 93.3% of positivity for avian poxvirus. In the phylogenetic study, samples show 100% matching suggesting that the outbreak occurred by a single viral strain and was different from those strains affecting other wild birds such as canaries and sparrows. A single mutation (Adenine for Guanine) was detected in our study's strain and in the strains of turkey, chickens, and vaccine strains published in GenBank. Also, when the sequence strain of the present study and sequences from GenBank of canarypox and sparrowpox strains were aligned, a Thymine was found replacing the Adenine or Guanine. The in ovo vaccination method as single-use in turkeys of this study apparently did not provide adequate protection against avianpox disease, but additional vaccination administered by wing-web when turkeys were 45-60 days old in the new flocks controlled the disease. In the subsequent year, new cases of this disease were not found. It was not possible to confirm the source of the virus strain, but infection with a field strain derived from chickens is one possibility...(AU)

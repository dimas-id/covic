MHV3 has three distinct effects in different strains of mice: strain A mice are completely resistant, most strains (including C57BL, DBA/2, BALB/c and NZB strains) die of acute hepatitis whereas in certain strains (eg. C3H and A2G) the virus produces a persistent infection with neurological symptoms. In cultures of peritoneal macrophages from susceptible strains, MHV-3 replicated freely, with giant cell formation. No replication was observed in macrophages from strain A mice. In contrast to this full susceptibility or resistance, macrophage cultures from strains of mice in which persistent infections occur showed an intermediate susceptibility, as judged by the intensity of the cytopathic effect, the presence of viral antigens in the cytoplasm and levels of viral replication. Possible ways in which the intermediate susceptibility of macrophages and persistent infections might be related are discussed.

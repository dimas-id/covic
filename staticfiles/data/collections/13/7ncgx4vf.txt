A key issue in mathematics education is supporting students in developing general problem-solving skills that can be applied to novel, non-routine situations. However, typical mathematics instruction in the U.S. too often is dominated by rote learning, without exposing students to the underlying reasoning or alternate ways to solve problems. As a first step in addressing this problem, we present a cognitive task analysis study that investigates how students without a mathematics-related background solve novel non-routine problems. We found that most students were able to identify the underlying pattern that yields the final solution in each problem. Furthermore, they tended to use various forms of visualization in their draft work, but occasionally made computational mistakes. Based on these results, we propose our plan for developing an instructional platform that leverages learning science principles to train students in problem-solving abilities.

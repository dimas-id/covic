Abstract Synthesis of nitrogen and sulfur heterocyclic mimics of furanoflavonoids have been achieved for the first time. Synthesized flavonoid alkaloids and thiophenyl flavonoids have been screened for antifungal and antibacterial activities. All the test compounds barring 25 exhibited antifungal activity. The compound 19 was the best and showed comparable MICs to the known compound karanjin. Compounds 5, 12, 14 and 22 also showed comparable MIC to karanjin.

Abstract This chapter describes the importance of PADs for biomarker detection. The screening of disease markers and other biomolecules that related to health conditions have play important roles for an indication of the risk from infections and other diseases. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) is an excellent option for applications of biomarker detection because it contains all advantages which arise from the paper material. Moreover, the uncomplicated techniques including electrochemistry and colorimetry can be easily applied on PADs for the analytical detection. The detection method can be categorized into three main topics: enzymatic methods, immunoassays, and DNA sensors. Following the main context, other interesting applications also present in this chapter.

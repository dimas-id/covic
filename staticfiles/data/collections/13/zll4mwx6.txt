There are currently no licensed vaccines against Clostridium perfringens which causes necrotic enteritis in poultry. Chitosan nanoparticles were formulated with native (CN) or toxoids (CT) of extracellular proteins (ECP) of C. perfringens, both surface-tagged with Salmonella flagellar proteins. In a pH stability assay, CN and CT nanoparticles released 6% and 0% of their protein at 8.0 pH. In a protein release assay, CN and CT nanoparticles released 16% and 10% of their protein respectively at 7.4 pH after 24 h. CN and CT nanoparticles incubated at 100 µg/mL PBS with Chicken RBCs released 1% and 0% hemoglobin respectively. Ninety broilers were randomly assigned to treatments; sham-vaccinated (Control), CN-vaccinated (CN), and CT-vaccinated (CT). Each bird was orally gavaged with 50 µg vaccine in 0.5 mL PBS or 0.5 mL PBS only on d 0, 3, 7 and 14 of age. At 21 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-ECP IgA than control (P < 0.05). At 21 d of age, the CN and CT group had higher anti-ECP IgA than control (P < 0.05). At 17 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-flagellar IgG than control (P < 0.05). At 10 d of age, the CN group had higher anti-flagellar IgA than control (P < 0.05). Splenic T cells from chickens in the CN and CT group ex-vivo stimulated with 0.05 mg/mL ECP, had higher proliferation control (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 respectively). Splenic T cells from chickens in the CN and CT groups ex-vivo stimulated with 0.1 mg/mL ECP had proliferation than control (P < 0.05). Pooled serum from 17 d of age CN and CT-vaccinated birds partially neutralized toxins in 50 µg of ECP (P < 0.05). Pooled serum from 28 d of age CN-vaccinated birds also partially neutralized toxins in 50 µg of ECP. The result from this study indicates the potential for chitosan loaded with Clostridium perfringens extracellular proteins to be applied to necrotic enteritis challenge studies.

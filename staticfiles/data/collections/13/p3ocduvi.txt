Abstract Schiff bases are versatile organic compounds which are widely used and synthesized by condensation reaction of different amino compound with aldehydes or ketones known as imine. Schiff base ligands are considered as privileged ligands as they are simply synthesized by condensation. They show broad range of application in medicine, pharmacy, coordination chemistry, biological activities, industries, food packages, dyes, and polymer and also used as an O2 detector. Semicarbazone is an imine derivative which is derived from condensation of semicarbazide and suitable aldehyde and ketone. Imine ligandâ€“containing transition metal complexes such as copper, zinc, and cadmium have shown to be excellent precursors for synthesis of metal or metal chalcogenide nanoparticles. In recent years, the researchers have attracted enormous attention toward Schiff bases, semicarbazones, thiosemicarbazones, and their metal complexes owing to numerous applications in pharmacology such as antiviral, antifungal, antimicrobial, antimalarial, antituberculosis, anticancer, anti-HIV, catalytic application in oxidation of organic compounds, and nanotechnology. In this review, we summarize the synthesis, structural, biological, and catalytic application of Schiff bases as well as their metal complexes.

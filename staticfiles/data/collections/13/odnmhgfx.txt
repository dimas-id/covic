BACKGROUND Despite technical refinements of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement, complications such as early tube dislodgement remain relatively static. This study aimed to review the experience of a high-volume endoscopy center after the introduction of T-fastener placement in high-risk patients. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed PEG placement from October 2010 to September 2011, when their group began to use T-fasteners selectively in high-risk patients. Patients deemed to have an increased risk for early tube dislodgement underwent T-fastener placement at the time of PEG placement. Patients with PEG alone were compared with patients who had PEG with T-fastener (PEG-T) placement. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18. RESULTS During the study period, 195 patients underwent PEG placement. For 121 patients, PEG alone was performed, whereas PEG-T was performed for 74 patients. Six patients had tube dislodgement (five early, one late) in the PEG-T cohort versus none in the PEG-alone cohort (P = 0.003). The first patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with replacement gastrostomy 2 days after tube dislodgement and was noted to have no contamination, with direct apposition of the stomach to the abdominal wall from the T-fasteners. The subsequent four patients with early tube dislodgement underwent non-emergent PEG replacement in the endoscopy unit within 24 h after tube dislodgement. In the short-term follow-up period, no repeat dislodgements were noted. Early mortality in the entire cohort was experienced by 38 (19.5%) of the 195 patients. CONCLUSION Placement of T-fasteners in high-risk patients may decrease overall morbidity if early tube dislodgement occurs. The findings show the safety of non-emergent endoscopic replacement of PEGs in certain patients. Early tube dislodgement may be a marker of overall mortality.

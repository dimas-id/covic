Chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis, are a major cause of mortality worldwide. With the increasing incidence with ageing, the full impact of these diseases is yet to be realised. For most chronic lung diseases there are limited treatments options, with the existing approaches mainly addressing symptom relief. Little progress has been made, in recent years, in the development of new therapeutic strategies for managing these burdensome pathologies. There is an urgent need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these diseases. Endogenous progenitor cells (stem cells) have been recognised in many organs, including the lungs where they are suggested to maintain a population of cells that are able to facilitate the endogenous repair processes. Emerging knowledge of how these repair processes are disrupted in chronic lung diseases and the potential to capitalise upon the regenerative capacity of stem cell populations raise the hopes of the field worldwide for innovative treatment approaches for these devastating diseases in the future. This chapter outlines the series of diseases that may benefit from these emerging new therapeutic outlooks.

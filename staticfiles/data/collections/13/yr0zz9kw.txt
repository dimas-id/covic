BACKGROUND Postoperative sore throat (POST) following general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation is a common complication. We hypothesized that lidocaine jelly applied to the tapered cuff of the endotracheal tube (ETT) might decrease the incidence of POST most commonly arising from endotracheal intubation. METHODS A total of 208 patients under general anesthesia were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups. In the lidocaine group (n = 104), the distal part of ETTs with tapered-shaped cuff was lubricated with lidocaine jelly. In the control group (n = 104), the distal part of ETTs with tapered-shaped cuff was lubricated with normal saline. The incidence of POST, hoarseness, and cough in the postanesthesia patients was compared. RESULTS The overall incidence of POST was higher in the lidocaine group than in the normal saline group [60 (58%) vs 40 (39%), P = .006]. The incidence of POST at 1 hour postoperatively was higher in the lidocaine group than in the normal saline group [53 (51%) vs 32 (31%), P = .003]. The overall incidence of hoarseness for 24 hours postoperatively was comparable (P = .487). The overall incidence of cough for 24 hours postoperatively is higher in the lidocaine group (P = .045). CONCLUSION The lidocaine jelly applied at the distal part of ETT with tapered-shaped cuff increased the overall incidence of POST in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

A series of 15-min videos were produced to provide resources to pastors in African-American communities to aid them in conveying accurate public and mental health information about COVID-19. Video presenters included trusted experts in public and mental health and pastors with considerable experience responding to the needs of the African-American community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four culturally specific core themes to consider when providing care to African Americans who are at increased risk during the pandemic were identified: ritual disruption, negative reactions for not following public health guidelines, trauma, and culture and trust.

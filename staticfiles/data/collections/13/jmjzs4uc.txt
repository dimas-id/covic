Severe wasting of body tissues, diarrhea, high morbidity and mortality, and stunting are all characteristics of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS). The wasting of musculature and loss of nearly all adipose tissue suggested that even though the PEMS-infected poults were eating some feed, nutrient intake was not sufficient to meet body requirements for maintenance and growth. Because epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract appeared to be a target of the undefined etiological agent (or agents) that causes PEMS, a study was conducted in which PEMS-infected poults were evaluated for malabsorption through 3 wk of age. D-Xylose, a poorly metabolized pentose, was given per os as a bolus, and blood samples were obtained from the ulnar vein in the wing of control and PEMS-infected poults over a 3-h period to estimate intestinal absorption. D-Xylose absorption in control poults peaked 30 to 60 min after the oral treatment, similar to results reported earlier. The PEMS-infected poults did not show a peak in absorption. The PEMS-infected poults showed significant delays in D-xylose absorption at 4, 7, and 11 d after PEMS challenge. The severe malabsorption and metabolic deficiency problem associated with PEMS was postulated to be a direct effect of the undefined infectious agent or agents that cause the disease.

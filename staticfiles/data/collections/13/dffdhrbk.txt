The endovascular management of obstructive disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is challenging due to unique anatomical and biomechanical forces. Obstructive lesions of the SFA make up the largest proportion of lesions leading to symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Accordingly, endovascular treatment of SFA disease is becoming increasingly common and, in many cases, is the preferred initial therapy. The use of self-expanding nitinol stents have proven superior to percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty in the treatment of intermediate length SFA stenosis. However, achieving durable results, as well as attaining adequate therapy for long occlusions typically seen in clinical practice, remains problematic. Newer technologies, such as paclitaxel eluting stents, seem promising in improving outcomes.

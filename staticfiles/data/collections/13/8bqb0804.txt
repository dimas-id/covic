The Glasgow Subgraph Solver provides an implementation of state of the art algorithms for subgraph isomorphism problems. It combines constraint programming concepts with a variety of strong but fast domain-specific search and inference techniques, and is suitable for use on a wide range of graphs, including many that are found to be computationally hard by other solvers. It can also be equipped with side constraints, and can easily be adapted to solve other subgraph matching problem variants. We outline its key features from the view of both users and algorithm developers, and discuss future directions.

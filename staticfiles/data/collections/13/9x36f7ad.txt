This annual review covers the literature published in 2017 on topics related to the occurrence and fate of emerging environmental pollutants in wastewater. Due to the vast amount of literature published on this topic, we have discussed only a portion of the quality research publications, due to the limitation of space. The abstract search was carried out using Web of Science, and the abstracts were selected based on their relevance. In few cases, full-text articles were referred to better understand new findings. This review is divided into the following sections: antibioticresistant bacteria (ARBs) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), disinfection by-products (DBPs), estrogens, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and microplastics, a new section added this year.

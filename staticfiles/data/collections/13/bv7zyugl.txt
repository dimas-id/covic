Dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, and as a larger proportion of the population is being affected, more unusual manifestations are being reported. Very few studies have documented unusual manifestations of dengue in South India. This prospective study was undertaken from July 2011 to June 2013 to document rare manifestations of dengue fever in 175 hospitalized patients. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of NS1Ag, dengue IgM, or IgG by ELISA and/or a RT-PCR and CDC real-time PCR for dengue virus (DENV) RNA. The daily profiles of the hematological and biochemical investigations were followed and recorded. Unusual and rare manifestations of dengue were documented for 115 patients (66 %). Hepatitis was observed in 70 % of the cases. Pleural effusion was seen in 11 %, acute renal failure in 10 %, neurological complications such as encephalitis in 7.4 %, myocarditis in 9 %, and bleeding gastric ulcers in 3.4 % of the cases. DENV serotype 2 was more prevalent in patients with unusual manifestations of dengue in our study. The WHO classification system does not include unusual and rare manifestations; hence, it is essential to be aware of these manifestations and closely monitor them for better clinical management and outcome of patients.

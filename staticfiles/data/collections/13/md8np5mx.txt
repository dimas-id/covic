Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a huge pressure on healthcare systems across the globe, more so in developing countries. Not only patients of acute febrile illness and respiratory problems but also patients with other acute and chronic diseases are facing challenges while seeking healthcare, getting laboratory investigations done and obtaining medications. Healthcare workers have their challenges including limited resources, lack of personal protective equipments, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Resource husbandry, which refers to the judicious use of available stocks, is a vital concept that needs to be promoted during such challenging times to combat the shortage of medical resources while simultaneously providing effective treatment to the patients. Some easily implementable concepts of resource husbandry can have a significant impact and result in minimising trouble for many patients during a challenging time.

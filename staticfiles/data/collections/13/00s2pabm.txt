We investigated the relationship between the mean blood pressure (BP) at 24-72 h and the clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients treated with reperfusion therapy. The primary outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months after AIS, and was based on the mean systolic BP at 24-72 h post-AIS. Favorable outcome was defined as mRS scores of 0-2. A total of 1,540 patients treated with reperfusion therapy were enrolled in the study. Favorable outcomes occurred more frequently in patients with BP ≤ 130/80 mmHg, and the risks of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and early neurological deterioration were lower in this optimal BP group. Multivariable analysis showed a significant association between mean BP ≤ 130/80 mmHg at 24-72 h and favorable outcomes at 3 months after AIS (odds ratio 2.95, 95% confidence interval 2.32-3.77, p < 0.001). Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that BP ≤ 130/80 mmHg had a more significant impact on clinical outcome in patients with recanalization than in those without recanalization. These data indicate that a mean BP of ≤ 130/80 mmHg at 24-72 h post-AIS is independently associated with favorable outcomes in patients treated with reperfusion therapy, particularly in those with recanalization.

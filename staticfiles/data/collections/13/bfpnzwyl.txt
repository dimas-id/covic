Abstract Yellow head virus (YHV) is a pathogen of the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and, with gill-associated virus (GAV), is one of two known invertebrate nidoviruses. We describe sequences of the large replicase gene (ORF1a) and 5′- and 3′-terminal UTRs, completing the 26,662nt sequence of the YHV genome. ORF1a (12,219nt) encodes a ∼462,662Da polypeptide containing a putative 3C-like protease and a putative papain-like protease with the canonical C/H catalytic dyad and α+β fold. The read-through pp1ab polyprotein contains putative uridylate-specific endoribonuclease and ribose-2′-O-methyl transferase domains, and an exonuclease domain incorporating unusual dual Zn2+-binding fingers. Upstream of ORF1a, the 71nt 5′-UTR shares 82.4% identity with the 68nt 5′-UTR of GAV. The 677nt 3′-terminal region contains a single 60nt ORF, commencing 298nt downstream of ORF3, that is identical to N-terminal coding region of the 249nt GAV ORF4. Northern blots using RNA from YHV-infected shrimp and probes directed at ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2 and ORF3 identified a nested set of 3′-coterminal RNAs comprising the full-length genomic RNA and two sub-genomic (sg) mRNAs. Intergenic sequences upstream of ORF2 and ORF3 share high identity with GAV, particularly in the conserved domains predicted to mediate sgmRNA transcription.

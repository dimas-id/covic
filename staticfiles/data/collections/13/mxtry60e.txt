Abstract Many nonhuman adenoviruses (AdVs) of simian, bovine, porcine, canine, ovine, murine, and fowl origin are being developed as gene delivery systems for recombinant vaccines and gene therapy applications. In addition to circumventing preexisting human AdV (HAdV) immunity, nonhuman AdV vectors utilize coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor or other receptors for vector internalization, thereby expanding the range of cell types that can be targeted. Nonhuman AdV vectors also provide excellent platforms for veterinary vaccines. A specific nonhuman AdV vector when used in its species of origin could provide an excellent animal model for evaluating the vector efficacy and pathogenesis. These vectors are useful in primeâ€“boost approaches with other AdV vectors or with other gene delivery systems including DNA immunization and viral or bacterial vectors. When multiple vector inoculations are required, nonhuman AdV vectors could supplement HAdV or other viral vectors.

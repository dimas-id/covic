The treatment for rectal cancer and benign rectal lesions continues to progress in the arena of minimally invasive surgery. While surgical excision of the primary mass remains essential for eradication of disease, there has been a paradigm shift towards less invasive resection methods. Local excision is increasing in popularity for its low morbidity and excellent functional results in select patients. Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is a new technology developed to elevate the practice of local excision to state-of-the-art resection. The goal of this article is to evaluate the history, short-term outcomes, and evolution of the TAMIS technique for excision of benign and malignant rectal neoplasia.

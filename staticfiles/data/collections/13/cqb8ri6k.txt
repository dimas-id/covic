Recent studies from a number of model organisms have indicated chromatin structure and its remodeling as a major contributory agent for aging. Few recent experiments also demonstrate that modulation in the chromatin modifying agents also affect the life span of an organism and even in some cases the change is inherited epigenetically to subsequent generations. Hence, in the present report we discuss the chromatin organization and its changes during aging.

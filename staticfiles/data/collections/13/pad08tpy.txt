Cervical lymphadenopathy is common in children. The condition frequently results in a childâ€™s referral to a pediatric surgeon for further evaluation, and surgical intervention is often required. The majority of these masses represent benign disease, but the possibility of a malignancy exists. Parents often experience a significant amount of anxiety, and so it is important that pediatric surgeons are comfortable with the evaluation and management of these common lesions.

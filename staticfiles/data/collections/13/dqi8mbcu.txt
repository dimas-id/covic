The proximity required of a thorough biomicroscopic slit-lamp examination may put ophthalmologists at increased risk for respiratory-borne infection with SARS-CoV-2. Conjunctivitis has been described in a few patients with COVID-19 and other coronavirus syndromes. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the conjunctival secretions or tears of patients with COVID-19 and conjunctivitis, transmission of infection through respiratory droplets to ophthalmologists without eye protection or masks may be the bigger concern.

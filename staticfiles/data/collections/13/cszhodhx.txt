The nucleotide sequence of the matrix (M) protein gene of the bovine coronavirus (BCV) was determined by sequencing cDNA clones derived from genomic RNA. The gene was found to map at the 5' side of the nucleocapsid protein gene and its sequence predicts a protein of 230 amino acids having a molecular weight of 26,376. The BCV M protein shares extensive sequence homology with the matrix protein of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) but differs notably in the amino terminal region external to the virion envelope where BCV apparently uses at least two of its six potential O-glycosylation sites.

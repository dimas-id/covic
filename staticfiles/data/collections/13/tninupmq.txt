The generation of virus-mimetic nanoparticles has received much attention in developing a new vaccine for overcoming the limitations of current vaccines. Thus, a method, encompassing most viral features for their size, hydrophobic domain and antigen display, would represent a meaningful direction for the vaccine development. In the present study, a polymer-templated protein nanoball with direction oriented hemagglutinin1 on its surface (H1-NB) was prepared as a new influenza vaccine, exhibiting most of the viral features. Moreover, the concentrations of antigen on the particle surface were controlled, and its effect on immunogenicity was estimated by in vivo studies. Finally, H1-NB efficiently promoted H1-specific immune activation and cross-protective activities, which consequently prevented H1N1 infections in mice.

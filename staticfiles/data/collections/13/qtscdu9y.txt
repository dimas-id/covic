IgA vasculitis is a systemic small‐vessel vasculitis which may be triggered by different microorganisms. IgA vasculitis cases have been reported in patients with immune‐mediated inflammatory disorders treated with TNF inhibitors. Here we report the case of a young Crohn’s disease patient in clinical remission under adalimumab admitted for an IgA vasculitis, with an extended ileitis, and a positive PCR testing for Covid‐19. Serum IgA levels were markedly increased and serology for Covid‐19 was weakly positive for IgA. Even if we cannot prove the causality of Covid‐19, it is remarkable to note that this case of IgA vasculitis was associated with high IgA levels in the serum and the Covid‐19 serology was positive only for IgA.

Abstract Hong Kong is a compact territory in Southern China that enjoys a high degree of autonomy. Despite its dense population and uneven wealth distribution, infant mortality is low and life expectancy is long. The health service is more hospital and clinic based than community based. This seems cost-effective while professional standards are high and rigorously maintained. Drug registration follows American and European requirements. Hong Kong is a part of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme, which brings a high standard of drug regulation. Hong Kong is a good choice for clinical trials because the subjects are Chinese and protocols in English do not need to be translated. There are also 2 well-established clinical trials centers in university hospitals that also run Phase I and clinical pharmacology studies.

Desensitisation with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is essential for ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) liver transplants (LTs). However, excessive citrate load and coagulation disturbances after TPE have been poorly studied, in particular in cirrhotic patients with hypocapnic alkalosis, metabolic compensation and electrolyte imbalances. We retrospectively evaluated 1123 consecutive LT recipients (923 ABO-compatible [ABO-C], 200 ABO-I) from November 2008 to May 2015. TPE was generally performed a day before LT and blood sampling was performed before anaesthesia induction. We performed propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. In 199 PSM pairs, metabolic alkalosis was prevalent in ABO-I LT recipients (expectedly due to citrate conversion) with higher pH ≥ 7.50 (IPTW-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.23) than in ABO-C LT recipients. With increasing cirrhosis severity, the arterial pH and bicarbonate levels showed dose-dependent relationships, whereas mild hypoxaemia was more prevalent in ABO-I LT recipients. ABO-I LT recipients exhibited worsened hypokalaemia ≤3.0 mmol/l (17.6%, aOR = 1.44), hypomagnesaemia ≤1.7 mg/dl (27.6%, aOR = 3.43) and thrombocytopenia <30,000/µl (19.1%, aOR = 2.26) confirmed by lower maximal clot firmness (P = 0.001) in rotational thromboelastometry (EXTEM), which necessitated platelet transfusions. Preoperative identification of these change may prevent worsening of severe electrolyte disturbances and thrombocytopenia for optimal LT anaesthesia.

BACKGROUND: With increasing international travel and historically high numbers of residents visiting friends and relatives overseas, travel-associated illnesses are frequent in Marseille, France. We report the changing epidemiology of travel-related illnesses over a 12-year period. METHODS: A single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis was undertaken for 3460 ill returned travellers presenting to two public hospitals in Marseille, France from March 2003 to October 2015, with travel-related illnesses. Demographic characteristics, travel history, presenting symptoms and information on pre-travel consultations were collected. RESULTS: There was a predominance of travel to sub-Saharan Africa, in particular to Comoros archipelago. Tourism was the main reason for travel (1591/3460, 46%), followed by visiting friends or relatives (VFR) (895/3460, 26%), with a mean duration of 29 days; 35% (1212/3460) of travellers reported a pre-travel health consultation. The most common syndromic diagnoses were febrile systemic illness (1343, 39%), dermatologic (716, 21%), gastrointestinal (340, 10%) and respiratory/ear–nose–throat (331, ENT) (10%). Hospitalization rates were highest amongst travellers from sub-Saharan Africa (858/ 1632, 53%), and VFR (573/ 895, 64%, P < 0.001). Frequent diagnoses included malaria (797, 23%), dengue (96, 2.77%) and chikungunya (75, 2.17%), reflecting global trends. Comparison of two periods (2003–10 to 2011–15) demonstrated an increase in chikungunya and decrease in malaria and influenza-like illness. We report an increase in ill travellers from the Caribbean, Middle East and South-East Asia. CONCLUSION: Surveillance of travellers provides relevant sentinel information on the changing epidemiology of infectious diseases across the globe, most notably for malaria, dengue and chikungunya. We demonstrate the use of travel surveillance in improving pre-travel consultation needs and to address autochthonous vector-borne viral risks.

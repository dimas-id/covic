We are trying to illustrate operative, short-term, and pathological outcomes of transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) as a surgical procedure for patients who are suffering cancer in the lower or middle rectum. This study included 25 consecutive patients who underwent TaTME for the mid and low cancer rectum. The primary outcome measures included frequency of postoperative (PO) bleeding, leakage, ileus, days to regain bowel function, days for Foley's removal, and erectile function. The secondary outcome measures included operation time, status of resection margins, number, the quality of TME, and duration PO hospital stay. No recorded intraoperative complications. The mean hospital stay was 6.9 ± 2.6 days. The mean duration need for urinary catheter removal and flatus passage were 2.4 ± 2.1 and 1.5 + 0.9 days, respectively. The mean IPSS was returned to normal 12 months after surgery. The mean distal margin distance was 1.9 ± 1.1. Circumferential margin distance was > 1 mm in 23 (92%) patients. The mesorectum was complete in 22 (88%) patients. The survival rate was 88% over 3 years. TaTME could be considered as a safe, feasible, and effective surgical modality for patients who had mid and lower rectal tumors with an excellent pathological outcome.

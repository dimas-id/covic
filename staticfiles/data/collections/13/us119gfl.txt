Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) occur in around 3% of the entire population. IA rupture is responsible for the most devastating type of hemorrhagic strokes, with high fatality and disability rates as well as healthcare costs. With increasing detection of unruptured aneurysms, clinicians are routinely faced with the dilemma whether to treat IA patients and how to best treat them. Hemodynamic and morphological characteristics are increasingly considered in aneurysm rupture risk assessment and treatment planning, but currently no computational tools allow routine integration of flow visualization and quantitation of these parameters in clinical workflow. In this paper, we introduce AView, a prototype of a clinician-oriented, integrated computation tool for aneurysm hemodynamics, morphology, and risk and data management to aid in treatment decisions and treatment planning in or near the procedure room. Specifically, we describe how we have designed the AView structure from the end-user's point of view, performed a pilot study and gathered clinical feedback. The positive results demonstrate AView's potential clinical value on enhancing aneurysm treatment decision and treatment planning.

BACKGROUND Minimally invasive endoscopic surgery has become an acceptable method for gynecologic indications for more than 20 years. We aimed to compare clinical and surgical outcomes between mini-laparoscopic surgery (MLS) and conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for benign adnexal masses. As far as we know, no comparative study exists between these two minimal invasive procedures. METHODS During the period between January 2014 and December 2016, a total number of 132 laparoscopic surgeries were performed for bening adnexal masses in our clinic. Seventy women underwent CLS and 62 women underwent MLS. Pathological results and operating time of procedures, estimated blood loss, preoperative and postoperative complications, patient scale and observer scale (POSAS) and length of hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS There was no difference between the two groups regarding preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative surgical procedure performed, and length of hospital stay. The groups were compared in terms of postoperative pathological diagnosis using the Chi-square test, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Comparing the operation time and hematocrit change, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups. Both patient and observer PSOAS scar scores were better in MLS group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Mini-laparoscopy can be safely and effectively used to perform benign adnexal mass surgery.

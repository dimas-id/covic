With the beginning of the pandemic of COVID-19 throughout the world, the demand and consumption of hand sanitizers has increased, which had led to a sharp crunch in these products at all levels. This shortage has led to an increase in the prevalence of falsified alcohol-based hand sanitizers, including the illegal addition of methanol to hand sanitizers and the production of hand sanitizers with an alcohol concentration of less than 60%. These findings indicate that regulatory and public health bodies should take an active role in ensuring the safety and quality of antimicrobial products such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers at every stage of the products' lifecycle, including distribution, manufacture and import.

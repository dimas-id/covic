Thirty mice and six rats were exposed through handling, soiled bedding, or close contact to rats previously inoculated with sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV). All exposed rats developed coronaviral antibody without clinical signs or lesions of SDAV infection. Exposed mice had no lesions or clinical signs of coronavirus infection. Mice exposed by handling or by soiled bedding did not develop coronavirus antibody. Two of 10 mice exposed to SDAV-inoculated rats by close contact were coronavirus seropositive when tested 3 weeks postexposure. SDAV-inoculated rats and mice developed coronavirus lesions and antibody. These results suggest that rat-to-rat transmission of SDAV is likely via fomites or handling; however, rat-to-mouse transmission is unlikely when animals are housed and husbanded using modern techniques. Results also suggest that coronavirus antibody in mice is due to exposure to mouse coronavirus and not to rat coronaviruses.

Abstract Life depends on a membrane's ability to precisely control the level of solutes in the aqueous compartments, inside and outside, bathing the membrane. The membrane determines what solutes enter and leave a cell. Transmembrane transport is controlled by complex interactions between membrane lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. How the membrane accomplishes these tasks is the topic of this chapter.

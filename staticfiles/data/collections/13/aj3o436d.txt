In the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, the presence of acute respiratory failure is generally associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome; however, it is essential to consider other differential diagnoses that require different, and urgent, therapeutic approaches. Herein we describe a COVID-19 case complicated with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax. A previously healthy 45-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain and progressive shortness of breath 17 days after diagnosis with uncomplicated COVID-19 infection. He was tachypneic and presented severe hypoxemia (75% percutaneous oxygen saturation). Breath sounds were diminished bilaterally on auscultation. A chest X-ray revealed the presence of a large bilateral pneumothorax. A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the large bilateral pneumothorax, with findings consistent with severe COVID-19 infection. Chest tubes were inserted, with immediate clinical improvement. Follow-up chest CT scan revealed resolution of bilateral pneumothorax, reduction of parenchymal consolidation, and formation of large bilateral pneumatoceles. The patient remained under observation and was then discharged home. Bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax is a very rare, potentially life-threatening complication in patients with COVID-19. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this complication early to prevent potentially fatal consequences.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The safety and efficacy of the PulseRider for the treatment of wide-neck, bifurcation aneurysms at the basilar and carotid terminus locations were studied in a prospective trial, the Adjunctive Neurovascular Support of Wide-Neck Aneurysm Embolization and Reconstruction (ANSWER) trial, reporting on initial 6-month angiographic and clinical results. This report provides insight into the longer term durability and safety with 12-month data. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aneurysms treated with the PulseRider among enrolled sites were prospectively studied. Updated 12-month data on clinical and imaging end points are included. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were enrolled (29 women, 5 men) with a mean age of 60.9 years. The mean aneurysm height ranged from 2.4 to 15.9 mm with a mean neck size of 5.2 mm (range, 2.3-11.6 mm). At 1 year, there were no device migrations or symptomatic in-stent stenoses. Raymond-Roy I occlusion was achieved in 53% of cases at the time of treatment and progressed to 61% and 67% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Adequate occlusion (Raymond-Roy I/II) progressed from 88% at 6 months to 90% at 12 months. No recanalizations were observed. There was 1 delayed ischemic event. Good outcome (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS The updated 1-year results from the ANSWER trial demonstrate aneurysm stability and an acceptable safety profile for aneurysms treated at the basilar apex and carotid terminus. Prospective data from a larger set of aneurysms treated at other locations are required to assess how treatment with PulseRider compares with alternatives for treating wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms.

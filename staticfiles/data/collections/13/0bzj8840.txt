Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern due to a highly pathogenic human coronavirus (HCoV), actually named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite much emerging data about the epidemiological association between cardiovascular diseases and COVID-19, little is still known atrial fibrillation (AF) and its optimal management in this clinical contest. The aim of our review is to describe the pharmacological interactions between cardiovascular drugs more commonly used in AF management and experimental COVID-19 therapies, based on European (EU) and Unites States (US) summaries of product characteristics.

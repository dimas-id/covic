This commentary offers a dialogue between a researcher and practitioner on the potential benefits of collaborative research to benefit survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV), a population exposed to high levels of violence and trauma. The dialogue occurred in a written, back-and-forth exchange, with the researcher and practitioner taking turns asking and responding to questions. The questions posed and answered in this commentary include: How are clients at an emergency domestic violence shelter experiencing the pandemic? How do you think a researcher or community member can help during a time like this? What should a researcher consider when engaging in collaborative research partnerships with service providers during this time? The answers offer insights into the importance of developing strong researcher-practitioner partnerships to improve services for trauma survivors during a global crisis.

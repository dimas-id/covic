BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery has been at the forefront of minimally invasive surgery. Benefits include no visible scars, less pain, and shorter recovery time. We describe a video of a 37-year-old female who underwent a pure transvaginal appendectomy (TVA) for acute appendicitis. This is 1 of 18 successfully performed TVAs at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Appropriate Institutional Review Board was obtained preoperatively. METHODS The patient was positioned in steep Trendelenburg and then a weighted speculum was introduced into the vagina allowing exposure of the posterior vaginal fornix. The cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum on the posterior cervical lip and the posterior vaginal fornix was visualized. Access to the peritoneum was achieved by electrocautery and then sharp dissection. A SILS™ port (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) was introduced and pneumoperitoneum up to 15 mmHg was achieved. Two 5-mm trocars and one 12-mm trocar were used. A 5-mm 30° angled endoscope, a flexible reticulating endograsper, and straight standard instruments were used. The identified appendix was dissected and a stapler was used to divide the mesoappendix from the appendix. Following confirmation of good hemostasis and no spillage of bowel contents, the appendix was removed from the abdomen within a retrieval bag and the culdotomy was closed with a running absorbable suture. The patient tolerated the 27 min procedure well and was discharged home in good condition on postoperative day 1.

We present our initial experience with single-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) surgery using a Korean-made laparoscopic port (OCTOâ„¢ Port). In a retrospective study, single-port access TLH (SPA-TLH) with the OCTO Port was performed on 34 patients with benign gynaecological indications from July 2013 to May 2014 by two surgeons (Ahmet Kale and Hasan Terzi). All patients were divided into two groups. The first 15 patients who underwent SPA-TLH were classified as Group 1, and the second 19 patients who underwent SPA-TLH were classified as Group 2. Patient data were analyzed for age, body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), weight of uterus, vaginal cuff suturation time, estimated blood loss, operation time, hysterectomy indications and operative outcomes. The median time needed for the surgery was 75 min in both groups. The duration of suturing of the vaginal cuff was shorter in Group 2 compared with that in Group 1. The estimated blood loss was less in Group 2 compared with Group 1: Four patients in Group 1 required blood transfusion while none of the patients in Group 2 required blood transfusion. The OCTO Port has soft and flexible instrumental movements, which can reduce crowding of instruments during surgery, and the cap rotates 360 degrees. The OCTO Port might facilitate the learning curve of single-port laparoscopic hysterectomy surgery.

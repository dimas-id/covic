RNA viruses with segmented genomes were the first model used for molecular analysis of viral neuropathogenesis, since they could be analysed genetically by reassortment. Four viruses with non–segmented genomes have been used as models of neurovirulence and demyelinating disease: JHM coronavirus, Theiler's virus, Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Virus gene expression in the central nervous system of infected animals has been measured by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Cell tropism has been analysed by neural cell culture. Infectious clones have been constructed for Theiler's virus, Sindbis virus and SFV, and these allow analysis of the sequences involved in the determination of neuropathogenesis, through the construction of chimeric viruses and site–specific mutagenesis. Measles and rubella viruses have been studied in animal systems because of their importance for human disease. The importance of two recently discovered mechanisms of neuropathogenesis, antibody–induced modulation of virus multiplication, and persistence of virus in the absence of multiplication, remains to be assessed.

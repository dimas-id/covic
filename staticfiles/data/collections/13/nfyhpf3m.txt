The size distribution of second phase precipitates is frequently determined using conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM). However, other techniques, which present different advantages, can also be used for this purpose. In this paper, we focus on high angle annular dark field (HAADF) in TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging modes. The mentioned techniques will be first described, then compared to more conventional ones for the measurement of carbides size distribution in two FeCV and FeCVNb model alloys. This comparative study shows that STEM in SEM, a technique much easier to undertake compared to TEM, is perfectly adapted for size distribution measurements of second phase particles, with sizes ranging between 5 and 200 nm in these systems.

There is currently limited knowledge about the transmission risks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated disease COVID-19 from routine clinical specimens. The first study to be published on the initial 41 cases of COVID-19 infections admitted in Wuhan detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the blood of 6/41 (15%) of patients (Huang et. al., 2020) . However, another study conducted on 1070 clinical specimens collected from confirmed COVID-19 patients in China showed the highest positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 from rRT-PCR testing of respiratory specimens such as bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs (32% - 93%). In contrast, only 1% of blood specimens and none of the urine specimens tested positive (Wang et. al., 2020).

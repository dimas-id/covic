INTRODUCTION Approximately 7% of child patients with inguinal hernias also present with cryptorchidism. On the other hand, combined adult cases are uncommon. Here we report two adult cases of inguinal hernia combined with intra-canalicular cryptorchidism who underwent totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with orchiectomy under the same operative view. PRESENTATION OF CASES We treated two patients (49- and 38-year-old men) with right indirect inguinal hernias and cryptorchidism. Both patients underwent TEP repair with orchiectomy. In operative findings, an atrophic testis was drawn out with a hernia sac from the internal inguinal ring. After the testis was separated from the sac and cord structure was sheared, it was removed. The procedure did not require special techniques and devices. In both patients, the postoperative courses were satisfactory. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, there has been only one such reported case till date which demonstrated the feasibility of TEP repair accompanied by orchiectomy. CONCLUSIONS TEP repair with orchiectomy under the same operative view could be safely performed in adults with an inguinal hernia combined with extra-abdominal cryptorchidism. This procedure could be an option for the treatment of such adult patients.

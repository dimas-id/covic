Abstract This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. As is the case with all other species, rats are susceptible to a variety of injuries and diseases that can cause distress, morbidity, or mortality. Any facility that houses rats must develop monitoring programs designed to rapidly identify health-related problems so they can be communicated to appropriate veterinary or animal care personnel to be resolved. These programs generally consist of multiple components, some of which are directed toward individual animals and others that assess the health status of rat populations as a whole. Topics include individual animal monitoring and care, signs of illness and distress, colony health management, components of microbiological monitoring programs, including agents commonly targeted and sentinel programs, quarantine, biological material screening, diagnostic testing methodologies, including culture, serology, molecular diagnostic and histopathology, test profiles and interpretation, management of disease outbreaks, and treatment and prevention strategies for infectious agents.

Twelve of the estimated 1500–1700 taxa in Peperomia show a particular feature: their terminal inflorescences seem to originate from the base of a leaf blade as a result of the presence of a sessile leaf at the base of these inflorescences. Three of these 12 taxa occur in Ecuador and four species are reported from Colombia. From Peru, two species are known from historical herbarium collections, and three other species are new to science. One new species is described from Bolivia. Collections of all 12 species are quite rare and, in the past, their identification seems to have been rather problematic. Previous authors have referred to these inflorescences as epiphyllous but, as shown here, this is not a correct description. To make a clear distinction from genuine epiphyllous inflorescences, the term ‘pseudo‐epiphyllous’ is proposed. In addition to the publication of four new species of Peperomia, emended descriptions are provided for the other species, synonymy is treated, and lectotypes are designated. The architecture of the plants is discussed and a key to the 12 species is provided. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 157, 177–196.

BACKGROUND Hydroxyethylstarch (HES) is a synthetic polymer of glucose that has been suggested for therapeutic use in long-term plasma expansion. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the infusion of a small volume of HES may provide benefits in systemic and regional hemodynamics and metabolism in a brain-dead canine model compared with large volume crystalloid resuscitation. METHODS Fourteen mongrel dogs were subjected to a brain-death protocol by consecutive insufflations of a balloon catheter in the epidural space. One hour after induction of brain-death, the animals were randomly assigned to two groups: NS (0.9% NaCl, 33 mL/kg), and HES (6%HES 450/0.7, 17 mL/Kg). Systemic and regional hemodynamics were evaluated using Swan-Ganz, ultrasonic flowprobes, and arterial catheters. Serial blood samples were collected for blood gas, electrolyte, and serum chemistry analysis. Systemic, hepatic, and splanchnic O(2)-derived variables were also calculated. RESULTS Epidural balloon insufflations induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output (MAP and CO, respectively), regional blood flow, and systemic vascular resistance. Following the hyperdynamic phase, severe hypotension with normalization of systemic and regional blood flow was observed. Fluid resuscitation induced a prompt increase in MAP, CO, and portal vein blood flow, and a significant reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. There were no differences between groups in metabolic indices, liver function tests (LFTs), or renal function tests. HES was more effective than NS in restoring cardiac performance in the first 2h after fluid resuscitation (P < 0.05). Both tested solutions partially and temporarily restored systemic and regional oxygen delivery. CONCLUSION Small volumes of 6% HES 450/0.7 improved cardiovascular performance and provided the same regional hemodynamic and metabolic benefits of large volumes of isotonic crystalloid solutions.

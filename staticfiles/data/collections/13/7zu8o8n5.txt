The Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) have long been used to model vagueness and have been used in decision making, pattern recognition, image processing, and other applications. In this study, IVIFSs are defined using Gaussian membership functions (GMFs), and new measures of the distance, the overlap, and the angle between two sets are developed. The proposed methodology is used to determine the similarities between test subjects in genetic brain profiling.

Aim: This scoping review provides a summary of the features, outcomes and lessons learned of Interprofessional Education (IPE) Placements in Allied Health professional-entry programs. The provision of these placements is one strategy to prepare students for Interprofessional Practice. Methods: Eight databases were systematically searched. Eligibility criteria included Allied-Health interprofessional student groups, professional-entry level programs, interprofessional supervision placements and implementation of a novel model. We accepted all types of peer-reviewed, published papers. Data charting and synthesizing occurred, with a data- subset presented in themes related to the features, outcomes and lessons learnt of IPE Placements. Results: The included 27 papers originate from a variety of countries (2002-2017). Whilst the features of the models varied considerably, features were identified that occurred in a high number of the papers. Positive outcomes were consistently reported for student learning. Thorough planning and investment arose as important themes, ensuring a positive placement experience and understanding of the IPE pedagogy from all stakeholders. Conclusions and Significance: This review provides insights into the features and outcomes of IPE placement models in Allied Health programs. The review expands the body of knowledge which previously focused on nursing and medicine and can inform educators about IPE placement implementation.

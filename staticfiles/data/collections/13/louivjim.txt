Abstract Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are RNA-protein assemblies involved in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism and are linked with memory, development and disease. Some RNP granules form, in part, through formation of intermolecular RNAâ€“RNA interactions. In vitro, such trans RNA condensation occurs readily, suggesting that cells require mechanisms to modulate RNA-based condensation. Herein, we assess mechanisms of RNA condensation and how cells modulate this phenomenon. We propose that cells control RNA condensation through ATP-dependent processes, static RNA buffering, and dynamic post-translational mechanisms. Moreover, perturbations in these mechanisms can be involved in disease. This reveals multiple cellular mechanisms of kinetic and thermodynamic control to maintain the proper distribution of RNA molecules between dispersed and condensed forms.

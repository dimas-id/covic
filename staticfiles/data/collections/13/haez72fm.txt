A workshop on Emerging Respiratory Viral Infections and Spontaneous Diseases in nonhuman primates was sponsored by the concurrent Annual Meetings of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists and the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology, held December 1-5, 2012, in Seattle, Washington. The session had platform presentations from Drs Karen Terio, Thijs Kuiken, Guy Boivin, and Robert Palermo that focused on naturally occurring influenza, human respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus in wild and zoo-housed great apes; the molecular biology and pathology of these viral respiratory diseases in nonhuman primate (NHP) models; and the therapeutic and vaccine approaches to prevention and control of these emerging respiratory viral infections. These formal presentations were followed by presentations of 14 unique case studies of rare or newly observed spontaneous lesions in NHPs (see online files for access to digital whole-slide images corresponding to each case report at http://scanscope.com/ACVP%20Slide%20Seminars/2012/Primate%20Pathology/view.apml). The session was attended by meeting participants that included students, pathology trainees, and experienced pathologists from academia and industry with an interest in respiratory and spontaneous diseases of NHPs.

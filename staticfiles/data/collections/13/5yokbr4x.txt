Aim of this communication is to remind clinical professionals to be aware of ototoxic side effects of several specific drugs proposed for the treatment of the new virus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). In particular, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, as well as antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir and lopinavir can all present potential ototoxic side effects. The data in the literature do not offer specific information on their potential synergetic effects nor on their interactions.

BACKGROUND Improved animal models are needed to understand the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to food allergy. OBJECTIVE We sought to assess food allergy phenotypes in a genetically diverse collection of mice. METHODS We selected 16 Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains, as well as the classic inbred C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/cJ strains, for screening. Female mice were sensitized to peanut intragastrically with or without cholera toxin and then challenged with peanut by means of oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection and assessed for anaphylaxis. Peanut-specific immunoglobulins, T-cell cytokines, regulatory T cells, mast cells, and basophils were quantified. RESULTS Eleven of the 16 CC strains had allergic reactions to intraperitoneal peanut challenge, whereas only CC027/GeniUnc mice reproducibly experienced severe symptoms after oral food challenge (OFC). CC027/GeniUnc, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6J mice all mounted a TH2 response against peanut, leading to production of IL-4 and IgE, but only the CC027/GeniUnc mice reacted to OFC. Orally induced anaphylaxis in CC027/GeniUnc mice was correlated with serum levels of Ara h 2 in circulation but not with allergen-specific IgE or mucosal mast cell protease 1 levels, indicating systemic allergen absorption is important for anaphylaxis through the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, CC027/GeniUnc, but not C3H/HeJ or BALB/cJ, mice can be sensitized in the absence of cholera toxin and react on OFC to peanut. CONCLUSIONS We have identified and characterized CC027/GeniUnc mice as a strain that is genetically susceptible to peanut allergy and prone to severe reactions after OFC. More broadly, these findings demonstrate the untapped potential of the CC population in developing novel models for allergy research.

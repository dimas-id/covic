Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) often require transfusion. However, transfusion-related complications and decreased blood donation in Korea encourage the development of new treatment strategies for PD patients. Although transfusion-free (TF) operation is thought to be beneficial, results supporting its beneficial effects are lacking. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the impact on PD patients of a TF program. From December 2003 to April 2013, 80 consecutive patients with periampullary lesions underwent PD performed. These patients were divided into two groups as follows: 39 PD patients in the "before TF program" (Group 1) and 41 PD patients in the "after TF program" (Group 2). Among patients in Group 2, patients who agreed with the TF program were enrolled and proceed with the TF program prospectively. Participants in the TF program had perioperative blood augmentation and intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution. The perioperative data were compared with the two groups. The mean preoperative hemoglobin, operative times, and operative blood loss showed no significance between two groups. The mean postoperative hemoglobin was lower in Group 2 (11.7 g/dL vs 10.9 g/dL, P = 0.038). The mean amount of blood transfusion was significantly lower in Group 2. (950.8 mL vs 124.9 mL, P = 0.009). The TF program considerably decreases the amount of perioperative blood transfusion. The overall perioperative course and complication rate in the TF group were not inferior to those in the non-TF group. The TF program appears safe and should be considered in PD patients.

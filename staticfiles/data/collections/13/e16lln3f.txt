Abstract Basic research on SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand its detailed pathophysiology and identify best drug targets. Models that can faithfully reproduce the viral life cycle and reproduce the pathology of COVID-19 are required. Here, we briefly review the cell lines, organoids, and animal models that are currently being used in COVID-19 research.

We present the details of the first three single-portal access laparoscopic radical nephrectomies (S-Portal-RN) performed in patients with a malignant renal tumour that developed after a renal transplant. The mean operative time was 171.6 ± 37.5 min, with a mean blood loss of 126.6 ± 25.1 ml. A single small skin incision (5 cm) was performed to remove the kidney. No significant difference in glomerular filtration rate was observed postoperatively. The postoperative recovery was uneventful with favourable short-term outcomes and high patient satisfaction at the 2-mo follow-up. We believe that S-Portal-RN for renal cancer after a renal transplant can be performed without increased risks for the patients or for the transplanted kidney.

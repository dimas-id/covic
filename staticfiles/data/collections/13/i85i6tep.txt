BACKGROUND Stent-assisted coiling has expanded the treatment of complex wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. We present our experience with stent-assisted coiling, with an emphasis on procedure-related neurologic complications and the incidence of angiographic recurrence. METHODS A total of 480 patients with 501 aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coiling between January 2007 and December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results, and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. RESULTS Among the 480 patients, 423 (88%) were treated electively and 57 (11%) were treated in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were 22 (4.58%) overall procedure-related complications, which caused death in 4 patients (0.83%) and morbidity in 4 patients (0.83%). In a logistic regression analysis, the complications differed significantly among the patients with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-7.48; P = 0.03), patients with aneurysms treated with coiling before stenting (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.07-8.81; P = 0.04), and patients treated with multiple stents (OR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.02-24.07; P = 0.04). Angiographic follow-up was available for 396 patients (83.4%) for a mean of 13 months. The rates of recanalization and retreatment were 13.9% and 3.5%, respectively. In a logistic analysis, larger aneurysm size and initial incomplete aneurysm occlusion were predictors of recanalization. Clinical follow-up was available for 406 patients (85.6%) for a mean of 44.8 months, and 399 patients (98.3%) achieved a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5. CONCLUSIONS Stent-assisted coiling appears to be a safe and effective option for treating complex wide-necked aneurysms. Higher complication rates are associated with coiling before stenting, use of multiple stents, and hypertension. Stent delivery before coil deployment reduces the risk of procedural complications. Larger aneurysm size and initial incomplete occlusion are associated with aneurysm recanalization.

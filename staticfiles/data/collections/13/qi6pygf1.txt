PURPOSE Flat-panel computed tomography (FP-CT) is increasingly available in angiographic rooms and hybrid OR's. Considering its easy access, cerebral imaging using FP-CT is an appealing modality for intra-procedural applications. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FP-CT compared with perfusion computed tomography (CTP) and perfusion magnetic resonance (MRP) in cerebral perfusion imaging. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science up to June 2019 for studies directly comparing FP-CT with either CTP or MRP in vivo. Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data on diagnostic accuracy was extracted and pooled if possible. RESULTS We found 11 studies comparing FP-CT with CTP and 5 studies comparing FP-CT with MRP. Most articles were pilot or feasibility studies, focusing on scanning and contrast protocols. All patients studied showed signs of cerebrovascular disease. Half of the studies were animal trials. Quality assessment showed unclear to high risks of bias and low concerns regarding applicability. Five studies reported on diagnostic accuracy; FP-CT shows good sensitivity (range 0.84-1.00) and moderate specificity (range 0.63-0.88) in detecting cerebral blood volume (CBV) lesions. CONCLUSIONS Even though FP-CT provides similar CBV values and reconstructed blood volume maps as CTP in cerebrovascular disease, additional studies are required in order to reliably compare its diagnostic accuracy with cerebral perfusion imaging.

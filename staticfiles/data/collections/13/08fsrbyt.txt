PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The requirement for large quantities of therapeutic proteins has fueled a great interest in the production of recombinant proteins in plant bioreactors. The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. SUMMARY: Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we need further advancement in the optimization of lab protocols for up-scaling the production of such therapeutics at commercial level with a promise to offer their best clinical use.

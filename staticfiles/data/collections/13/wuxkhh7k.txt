Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has become a widely used modality of therapy for a variety of malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Despite advances in pharmacotherapy and transplantation techniques, infection remains one of the most severe and frequently encountered complications of allo-HSCT. This chapter will address the risk factors for development of infection following allo-HSCT, including those related to the host, the conditioning regimen, and the graft, as well as the timing of opportunistic infections after allo-HSCT. The most common bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections, as well as issues surrounding their diagnostics and treatment, will be discussed. Finally, this chapter will address vaccination and other preventative strategies to be utilized when caring for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.

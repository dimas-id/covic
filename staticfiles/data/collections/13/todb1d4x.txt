COVID‐19 crisis has lasted since the late 2019 to the present day. The severity of the disease is positively correlated with several factors, such as age and coexisting diseases. Furthermore, obesity is increasingly considered as a yet another risk factor, particularly, because it has been observed that people suffering from excessive body weight may experience a more severe course of COVID‐19 infection. On the basis of current research, in our nonsystematic review, we have investigated the extent to which obesity can affect the SARS‐CoV‐2 course and identify the potential mechanisms of the disease. We have also described the role of proper nutrition, physical activity and other aspects relevant to the management of obesity.

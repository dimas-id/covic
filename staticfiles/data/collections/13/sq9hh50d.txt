Viruses have evolved a myriad of strategies for promoting viral replication, survival and spread. Sequence analysis of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome predicts several proteins that are unique to SARS-CoV. The search to understand the high virulence of SARS-CoV compared with related coronaviruses, which cause lesser respiratory illnesses, has recently focused on the unique nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV and suggests evolution of a possible new virulence mechanism in coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV nsp1 protein increases cellular RNA degradation and thus might facilitate SARS-CoV replication or block immune responses.

Coronaviruses are a well-known cause of upper and lower respiratory disease, and since 2002 have been a recognized source of potential pandemic spread. Over the past two decades, since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, a large body of research has accumulated on the virology, clinical symptoms and signs, and experimental treatments of Coronaviruses. In 2020, a new form of Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) emerged and spread rapidly throughout the globe. Given the wide-ranging clinical presentations of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, other viruses might be overlooked when evaluating at-risk patients. Furthermore, due to suboptimal testing capabilities, an early clinical diagnosis is not always possible. Here, we present a case of a patient with pneumonia thought to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 only to be found to have another Coronavirus. This emphasizes the need to be vigilant when evaluating patients with viral-like respiratory infections.

A divergent human gammapapillomavirus (γ-HPV) genome in a nasal swab from an elderly Finnish patient with respiratory symptoms was genetically characterized. The L1 gene of HPV-Fin864 shared <70% nucleotide identity to other reported γ-HPV genomes, provisionally qualifying it as a new species in the Gammapapillomavirus genus.

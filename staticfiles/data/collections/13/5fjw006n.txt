Studies on the diversity, taxonomy, phylogeny, and biogeography of Neotropical Fishes have thrived over the twenty years that have elapsed since the first symposium on their phylogeny and classification in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Here, we review recent advances in the study of Neotropical fishes and assess the known diversity of freshwater species in that region. 6,255 valid freshwater species have been discovered in the Neotropics so far, and we estimate that over 9,000 species will be known when the inventory is complete. We also summarize the events of the second Symposium on Phylogeny and Classification of Neotropical Fishes that took place last year in Londrina, Brazil. Along with invited talks on the biodiversity of all major groups of Neotropical fishes, a series of presentations on the development of fish collections, and numerous contributed talks, the meeting included a special session to honor Dr. Richard Vari, who was one of the most prolific and beloved members of our community.(AU)

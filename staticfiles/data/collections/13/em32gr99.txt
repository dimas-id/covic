The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse is taking action to help those feeling depressed while home during the coronavirus pandemic, News 9 reported. Starting April 10, every city‐county health department in the state will be equipped with an iPad. Someone walk‐ing in needing help can use the iPad to speak with a mental health professional. The person can take the iPad home with them to continue conversations with the provider. “There's a button on it. They hit the button and it links up to community mental health providers in their area. Someone is able to talk with them and work through it,” said Carrie Slatton‐Hodges, the interim commissioner for the department. Eighty‐one sites across the state will have the iPads. Because of the state's large presence of telehealth technology, Slatton‐Hodges said the department has been able to continue performing 90% of services.

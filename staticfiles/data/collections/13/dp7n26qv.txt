Many natural compounds, found mainly in plants, are associated with the treatment of various diseases. The search for natural therapeutic agents includes compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. Among the many steps involved in bioprospection, extraction is the first and most critical step for obtaining bioactive compounds. One of the main advantages of using compressed fluids extraction is the high quality of the final product obtained due to the use of green solvents, while the selectivity towards target compounds can be tuned by adjusting the process parameters, especially pressure, temperature and solvent characteristics. In this review, a discussion is provided on the power of compressed fluids, such as supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and subcritical water extraction (SWE) to obtain antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds from natural sources. In addition, an adequate knowledge about the identity and quantity of the compounds present in the extract is essential to correlate biological activity with chemical composition. Phytochemical profiling tools used for identification and quantification of these bioactive natural compound are also discussed. It can be anticipated that after the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic, the search of new natural compounds with antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity will be a hot research topic, so, this review provides an overview on the technologies currently used that could help this research.

Twenty-one moribund calves with diarrhoea were purchased from 11 farms, their faeces examined for enteropathogens and samples of intestinal tissue removed under anaesthesia. Lesions and presence of enteropathogens on the mucosal surface were scored by histological examination of immunostained paraffin sections. Two or more enteropathogens were detected in 19 calves. Cryptosporidium appeared to be the principal cause of diarrhoea in six calves, rotavirus in four, Salmonella typhimurium in two, bacteria adherent to the surface of the large intestine in two, coronavirus in one and K99 + Escherichia coli in one calf. Diarrhoea in four calves was the consequence of mixed infections in which no one enteropathogen appeared to predominate. In one calf no enteropathogen was detected. Diarrhoea was associated with infections and lesions throughout the small and large intestines. The enteropathogens most frequently associated with lesions in the small intestines were rotavirus, coronavirus and Cryptosporidium; in the large intestines they were coronavirus and bacteria apparently adherent to the mucosal surface.

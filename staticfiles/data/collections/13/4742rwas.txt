Laws are fundamental tools that regulate and manage various issues to protect the rights of the people in a society. Legislation on disease surveillance enables agencies to regulate and manage public health, including preventing the spread of infectious diseases. We assessed the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act of Korea (IDPCA) through the lens of biosurveillance to understand its effectiveness in protecting public health. In addition, the relevant legislation and regulations of the United States and the World Health Organization were examined. The evaluation concludes that the current IDPCA is limited in terms of providing guidance for early detection of and response to hazards using integrated data and an information-sharing system. Further revision of the laws is needed to enable early detection and warning of potential threats to public health.

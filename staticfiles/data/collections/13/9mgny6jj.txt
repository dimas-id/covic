Mambalgin-1 is a peptide that acts as a potent analgesic through inhibiting acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC) in nerve cells. Research has shown that ASIC channels are involved in the proliferation and growth of cancer cells; therefore, Mambalgin-1 can be a potential anti-cancer by inhibiting these channels. In the present study, the Nicotiana benthamiana codon optimized Mambalgin-1 gene was synthesized and cloned in PVX (potato virus X) viral vector. The two cultures of Agrobacterium containing Mambalgin-1 and P19 silencing suppressor genes were co-agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Five days post infiltration, the production of recombinant Mambalgin-1 was determined by western blotting. For biological activity, MTT (3(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was analyzed for the cytotoxicity recombinant Mambalgin-1 from the transformed plants on nervous (SH-SY5Y) and breast (MCF7) cancer cells. The results showed that the plants expressing open reading frame of Mambalgin-1 showed recombinant 7.4 kDa proteins in the entire plant extract. In the MTT test, it was found that Mambalgin-1 had cytotoxic effects on SH-SY5Y cancer cells, yet no effects on MCF7 cancer cells were observed. According to the results, the expression of the biologically active recombinant Mambalgin-1 in the transformed plant leaves was confirmed and Mambalgin-1 can also have anti-cancer (inhibition of ASIC channels) potential along with its already known analgesic effect.

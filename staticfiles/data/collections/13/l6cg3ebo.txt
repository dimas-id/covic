Shortage of talents in the field of disease prevention and public health exposed by COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of developing preventive medical education. This article analyzes the challenges of medical education in the dilemma of "separation of medical treatment and prevention", and the new requirements for preventive medical education in the construction of New Medicine under the Healthy China strategy. Four aspects including stepping up the resource allocation and investment, educating responsible public health professionals, the education of all medical students who implement the core competence of public health, and the establishment of a continuing education system for preventive medicine have been considered. A series of specific suggestions are put forward including the establishment of a full-chain closed-loop research system to support the cultivation of top-notch innovative public health talents, strengthening the assessment of core public health capabilities for clinical medical professional admission, formulating a "medical and preventive integration" training program for primary health personnel, and implementing "combination of peace and war" public health personnel reserve system, with the purpose of providing reference for the reform and development of preventive medical education in China.

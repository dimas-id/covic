The vast majority of patients in the ongoing coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic primarily present with severe respiratory illness. We report a Covid-19 patient who presented with findings of acute coronary syndrome and was found to have purulent fulminant myopericarditis and cardiac tamponade. We compare our case to the previously reported instances of Covid-19-associated myocarditis. Through review of the available literature, we also highlight the potential mechanisms of cardiac injury in Covid-19. We hope to increase awareness amongst clinicians about this unusual presentation of Covid-19.

PURPOSE Vaginal and perineal reconstruction following wide resection of locally invasive rectal cancer can be challenging. Various techniques have been reported, all of which contribute the additional morbidity inherent in tissue procurement. We present a technique applicable to nonhysterectomized patients who undergo posterior vaginal wall reconstruction with retroversion of the in situ uterus. METHODS Four nonhysterectomized patients with recurrent rectal carcinoma and abdominoperineal resection with en bloc resection of the posterior vagina leaving a large defect necessitating reconstruction of the vagina, perineum, or both, have undergone posterior vaginal wall and perineal reconstruction with uterine retroversion into the posterior pelvis and fixation to the perineum. RESULTS Satisfactory vaginoperineal reconstruction was achieved in all our patients at 3 months. In addition, patients are able to resume sexual activity after tissue re-epithelialization. CONCLUSION Uterine retroversion is a viable option for vaginal and perineal reconstruction.

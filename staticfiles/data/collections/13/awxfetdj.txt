Abstract This article focuses on the critical care nurseâ€™s role in the management of patients with COVID-19 who require invasive ventilation in order to improve outcomes and prevent complications. The nature of COVID-19 is such that many patients deteriorate rapidly and for members of this group requiring intubation and invasive ventilation, different approaches to airway management and ventilatory support are required. In order to reduce the risk of complications and an overview of invasive ventilation, including commonly used modes, potential complications, nursing care, weaning and extubation are all described. COVID-19 presents several challenges as the disease progresses, hypoxemia may worsen, and the patient can develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Therefore, additional treatment strategies including the use of the prone position and the use of nitric oxide and prostacyclin nebulisers have been included. The strategies presented in this article are relevant to both critical care nurses and those re-deployed to intensive care units where nurses will inevitably be involved in the management of patients requiring invasive ventilation. Weaning these patients off invasive ventilation is multi-factorial and may be short or long term. A multi-disciplinary weaning plan, the principles, stages/phases, and speed of weaning with expected parameters prior extubation are explained. Planned and unplanned extubation with the serious complications of the latter as the patient may not be ready and may require emergency re-intubation resulting in setbacks should be avoided.

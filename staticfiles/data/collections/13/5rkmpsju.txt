OBJECTIVE This study was performed to investigate whether the Penumbra 5MAX ACE is superior to other Penumbra systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective, single center analysis of patients with acute ischemic stroke with occlusion of the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery (M1 segment) who underwent endovascular therapy using a Penumbra system. The reperfusion success rate, puncture-to-revascularization time, and number of passes were assessed. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent factors related to revascularization within 60 minutes. Successful revascularization was defined by a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score ≥2b. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was used in 24 of the 40 patients (60%). Although the revascularization success rate was similar between patient groups (P = .229), the number of passes was significantly lower (1.5 ± .8 versus 2.6 ± 1.3, P = .006) and the puncture-to-revascularization time was shorter (50 ± 26 minutes versus 116 ± 69 minutes, P = .002) in patients treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE was identified as an independent factor for early revascularization (odds ratio, 5.80; P = .041). Among patients with a premorbid modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1, a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months was observed in 15 of the 19 patients (79%) treated with the Penumbra 5MAX ACE and in 8 of the 16 (50%) who were not (P = .072). CONCLUSION Acute revascularization therapy using the Penumbra 5MAX ACE can achieve rapid successful recanalization and tend to improve clinical outcomes.

The field of possible application of mesenchymal stem cells in medicine and research expanded tremendously with the advent of improved Lentiviral-vectors capable of inserting stable copies of genes of interest and expressing proteins or biologically active RNA species ad libitum, performing delicate gene editing or active gene silencing or serving as advanced drug delivery systems utilized in ex vivo cell therapy. The combination of these two fields has created a number of new areas of research in the landscape of modern medicine which are now extensively studied and discussed here. These areas include tissue engineering, tissue repair, wound healing and tissue implants, anticancer therapies, angiogenesis, myocardial infarction and repair as well as understanding and treating acute lung damage and injury. In addition, genetically modified, tagged MSCs are being intensively deployed in research and therapeutic attempts of the various ailments of the central nervous system including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, various phases of acute ischemia and trauma. The emergence of new and important data for type II diabetes research is being followed with treatment suggestions and studies of senescence to find novel applications for genetically engineered MSCs. We find in ­general that genetically modified MSCs are at the cusp of breaking through from basic research into the next phase of clinical trials.

Biofilm-impaired tissue is a significant factor in chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. Most, if not all, anti-biotics in clinical use have been optimized against planktonic phenotypes. In this study, an in vitro assessment was performed to determine the potential efficacy of a unique first-in-class series of antibiofilm antibiotics and compare outcomes to current clinical standards of care. The agent, CZ-01179, was formulated into a hydrogel and tested against mature biofilms of a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 using two separate methods. In the first method, biofilms were grown on cellulose discs on an agar surface. Topical agents were spread on gauze and placed over the biofilms for 24 h. Biofilms were quantified and imaged with confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In the second method, biofilms were grown on bioabsorbable collagen coupons in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Coupons were immersed in treatment for 24 h. The first method was limited in its ability to assess efficacy. Efficacy profiles against biofilms grown on collagen were more definitive, with CZ-01179 gel eradicating well-established biofilms to a greater degree compared to clinical standards. In conclusion, CZ-01179 may be a promising topical agent that targets the biofilm phenotype. Pre-clinical work is currently being performed to determine the translatable potential of CZ-01179 gel.

OBJECTIVE To determine the successful decannulation rate with a published pediatric tracheostomy decannulation protocol. STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING A single tertiary care institution. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A chart review was performed for patients aged ≤5 years who underwent tracheostomy. Extracted data included demographic data, indication for tracheostomy, age at tracheostomy and decannulation, comorbidities, and surgical complications. Records were searched for documentation of early decannulation failure (within 1 month of decannulation) or late failure (within 1 year). RESULTS Forty patients with a tracheostomy aged ≤5 years underwent attempted decannulation during the 11-year study period. Seventeen patients were excluded from the study for documentation of nonprotocol decannulation. The final study population of 23 patients underwent a total of 27 decannulations, 26 of which were performed by protocol. Of the 26 protocol decannulations, 22 were successful, for a failure rate of 15%. CONCLUSION Twenty-six protocol decannulations were attempted among 23 patients, 4 of which were unsuccessful for an overall failure rate of 15%. This result is consistent with rates reported in other published decannulation protocols. We believe that our protocol minimizes resource utilization in its use of pulse oximetry over polysomnography, while maximizing patient safety and success through the use of capping trials for very young and very small pediatric patients.

Ruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) usually require treatment to avoid re-bleeding. Depending on the angioarchitecture and center strategy, the treatment can be surgical, endovascular, radiosurgical or combined methods. The classic endovascular approach is transarterial, but sometimes it is not always applicable. The transvenous approach has been described as an alternative for the endovascular treatment of small AVMs when arterial access or another therapeutic method is not possible. This approach can be considered when the nidus is small and if there is a single draining vein. We present a technical note on a transvenous approach for the treatment of a ruptured AVM in a young patient.

Seven- to 10-month-old calves are the typical production of Galician Blond (GB), the most important bovine local beef breed in Spain. As meat lipid repercussions on human health depend on their fatty acid (FA) profile, this study aimed at analysing the individual FA at weaning and at the end of the feeding finishing period, especially trans and cis 18:1 isomers in total lipids of the Longissimus thoracis muscle in GB male calves. Distribution of main FA in veal lipids was characterized by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis on a high polar glass capillary column. Total trans and cis 18:1 isomers were purified, from total FA (TFA) methyl esters, by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, to allow subsequent specific analysis of their different isomers by GLC. Calves stayed with their mothers at pasture for 2 or 5 months in intensive or semi-extensive systems, followed by an indoor feeding period. The weaned (W) group was finished on concentrate and hay, whereas the non-weaned (NW) group was finished on concentrate and hay and it continued suckling until slaughter. The studied effects did not present interactions. The duration of the indoor finishing period hardly had a significant influence on the parameters analysed. Compared to W calves, NW calves had higher proportions (% TFA) of 18:3n-3 (+38%, P < 0.0001), 20:5n-3 (+22%, P = 0.005), 22:5n-3 (+13%, P = 0.042), cis monounsaturated FA (MUFA; +8%, P = 0.032), total MUFA (+8%, P = 0.013), n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; +25%, P = 0.0001) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; +48%, P < 0.0001) to the detriment of 18:0 (-10%, P = 0.002), 18:2n-6 (-25%, P = 0.004) and n-6 PUFA (-20%, P = 0.011). With regard to cis and trans 18:1 isomers, NW calves had higher proportions (% total cis or trans 18:1) of Δ11trans and Δ16trans (+25% and +22%, respectively, P < 0.01) and Δ13 + 14trans (+13%, P < 0.05) and lower proportions of Δ6 to 8 and Δ10trans (-28% and 58%, respectively, P < 0.001). NW calves' meat might be more suitable for human health than W calves' meat due to the increase of anti-atherogenous FA such as n-3 PUFA, CLA and 18:1 Δ11trans.

Abstract We report here the results of a 7-month survey of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in the Virology laboratory of the public hospitals of Marseille (Aprilâ€“November 2009). In total, 8 587 samples were analysed during this period, of which 1 974 (23%) were positive for the novel influenza variant. The analysis of results obtained using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) revealed a global sensitivity of 49.4% (vs. molecular qRT-PCR detection), strongly correlated with age groups (varying from 30% to 58% for patients >40 age and <10, respectively), indicating that RIDTs can be helpful in accelerating the management of suspected cases. Epidemiological analysis showed that the winter influenza wave began in October in Marseille (i.e. 2 to 3 months earlier than usual seasonal influenza outbreaks) and that the majority of autochthonous cases were observed in patients younger than 20 years old, with a low number of cases in patients over 60 years old. In November 2009, 22.2% (167/754) of patients with a laboratory diagnosis of influenza A/H1N1 infection were hospitalized, of which 9% (15/167) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients in the extreme age groups (>40 years old and <1) were significantly more often hospitalized than others, and 2.4% of hospitalized patients died. During the last 3 weeks of the period, the average number of bed-days attributable to H1N1sw-positive patients was 31.4, of which 5.9 were in ICUs.

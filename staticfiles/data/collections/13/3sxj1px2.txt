With the emergence of new viral infections, it is necessary to set up new target-specific assays, based on existing molecular techniques such as real-time PCR, as quickly as possible. Without these diagnostic tools, the geographical spread of new infections, follow-up of the disease outbreak and analysis of the pathogenesis of the disease are not possible. Therefore, the genomic information of the emerging pathogen, diagnostic protocols and standards allowing quality control need to be available in a few days. This can only be implemented with good quality experienced laboratories having suitable infrastructure to establish in-house assays. Even though these molecular tools are available quickly, challenges still remain with what sample types to select for a proper diagnostic value.

The precision medicine era has helped to better manage patients with immunological and oncological diseases, improving the quality of life of this class of patients. Regarding the management of these patients and positivity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), currently, limited data are available and information is evolving. In this quick review, we have analyzed the mechanisms of action and related infective risk of drugs used for the treatment of immune-mediated and oncologic skin conditions during the daily clinical practice. In general, immunosuppressant and antineoplastic agents for dermatologic treatments do not require suspension and do not require special measures, if not those commonly observed. In the case of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient with complications (such as pneumonia, respiratory failure), treatment suspension should always be considered after taking into account the general condition of the patient, the risk-benefit ratio, and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 emergency pandemic does not imply undertreatment of existing skin conditions, which together with the SARS-CoV-2 infection may jeopardize the patient's life.

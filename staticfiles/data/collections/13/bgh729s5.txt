The city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, was the origin of a severe pneumonia outbreak in December 2019, attributed to a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS‐CoV‐2]), causing a total of 2761 deaths and 81109 cases (25 February 2020). SARS‐CoV‐2 belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. The polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) remains unstudied thoroughly since it is similar to other sarbecoviruses. In this short communication, we performed phylogenetic‐structural sequence analysis of pp1ab protein of SARS‐CoV‐2. The analysis showed that the viral pp1ab has not changed in most isolates throughout the outbreak time, but interestingly a deletion of 8 aa in the virulence factor nonstructural protein 1 was found in a virus isolated from a Japanese patient that did not display critical symptoms. While comparing pp1ab protein with other betacoronaviruses, we found a 42 amino acid signature that is only present in SARS‐CoV‐2 (AS‐SCoV2). Members from clade 2 of sarbecoviruses have traces of this signature. The AS‐SCoV2 located in the acidic‐domain of papain‐like protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 and bat‐SL‐CoV‐RatG13 guided us to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus probably emerged by genetic drift from bat‐SL‐CoV‐RaTG13. The implication of this amino acid signature in papain‐like protein structure arrangement and function is something worth to be explored.

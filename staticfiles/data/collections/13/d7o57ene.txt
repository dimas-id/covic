The rationale for single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is minimizing morbidity, as well as improving cosmetic results of laparoscopic approach. This technique has been used for a variety of procedures and has recently been proposed for colonic resections as well. We report our preliminary experience of right colectomy, performed through a SILS approach. Five patients (3 males, 2 females, mean age 81.6 years) were selected to undergo SILS right colectomy for cancer. The procedure was carried out through a SILS multi-port device (SILSâ„¢ Port, Covidien Ltd, Norwalk, CT, USA), with either conventional or specially designed instruments. A medial-to-lateral approach and an extra-corporeal anastomosis were performed. In three cases, the procedure was completed through the SILS technique; in two of these cases a combined procedure was carried out (right colectomy plus cholecystectomy, right colectomy plus cholecystectomy plus i.o. colonoscopy and polypectomy). In one case, a switch to standard laparoscopy was necessary because of the large dimension of the tumour, while in the other case an intolerance of pneumoperitoneum was registered, thus requiring a conversion to open surgery. SILS procedures proved to be oncologically correct. No major complications occurred. In selected patients, SILS right colectomy for cancer appears to be feasible and oncologically safe. Beyond the cosmetic advantage, the procedure may reduce postoperative morbidity. Further studies are needed, with larger series and a longer follow-up, to determine the incidence of possible long-term complications and to evaluate possible cost-effectiveness of the procedure.

BACKGROUND Anatomic landmarks located on the proximal femur have only recently been defined, and there is a lack of radiographic guidelines for their locations presented in the literature. With the confident identification of these landmarks, radiographs could provide more assistance in preoperative evaluations, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative assessments. PURPOSE To quantify the radiographic locations of endoscopic landmarks of the proximal femur. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Ten cadaveric specimens were dissected, and radio-opaque hardware was placed for each landmark of interest. Radiographs were obtained and measurements recorded in anteroposterior (AP) and Dunn 45° views. RESULTS In the AP view, the gluteus medius insertion was located a mean 12.9 ± 2.4 mm and 34.7 ± 5.1 mm from the piriformis fossa and vastus tubercle, respectively. The piriformis fossa was a mean 14.8 ± 5.9 mm and 4.9 ± 1.9 mm from the anterior and posterior tips of the greater trochanter, respectively. The anterior and posterior tips of the greater trochanter were a mean 14.8 ± 5.1 mm from each other. In the Dunn 45° view, the piriformis fossa was a mean 13.3 ± 2.0 mm, and the vastus tubercle was a mean 21.5 ± 6.0 mm, from the gluteus medius insertion. Moreover, the vastus tubercle was a mean 33.5 ± 6.4 mm from the anterior tip of the greater trochanter and 31.6 ± 8.5 mm from the posterior tip of the greater trochanter. CONCLUSION In spite of the variation in cadaveric sizes, quantitative descriptions of endoscopic landmarks were reproducible in clinical views. CLINICAL RELEVANCE A detailed understanding of how the described landmarks present radiographically is relevant to preoperative planning, intraoperative evaluations, and postoperative assessments.

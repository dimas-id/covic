The 22nd annual meeting of the Willi Hennig Society was held at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, New York from July 20–24. There were 154 participants representing 15 countries and a total of 65 talks, 16 posters, and four software presentations. There were five symposia ranging from sequence alignment to worm biology to biogeography. As with Hennig 21 at Helsinki, there was strong student participation. Student posters represented 13 of the total 16 posters and 23 of 65 oral presentations were by students. Student presentations were part of all symposia. The strength and future of the Willi Hennig Society resides in the students and recent meetings indicate a healthy society for the future. The Student Awards Committee consisted of Jonathan A. Coddington, Arnold G. Kluge and Gunilla Ståhls. The winners were Taran Grant, the Hennig Prize ($1000) for “Insertions and deletions in the evolution of equal‐length DNA fragments”; Johannes Bergsten, the Brundin Prize ($500) for “Acilius Phylogeny (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae), Problems with Long‐branch attraction and Morphological Intersexual Coevolution”; and A. R. Lindgren, the Rosen Prize ($250) for “A New Phylogeny of the Cephalopoda Using Total Evidence”.

In this study, a single center's experience of 20 patients and a systematic review and a meta-analysis of 16 studies, including 279 patients/aneurysms, assessed the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. The authors conclude that endovascular treatment of distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms is associated with high angiographic occlusion rates, but the complication rates are higher compared with other aneurysms in the circle of Willis.

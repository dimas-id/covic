Pneumonia is the cause of significant morbidity and mortality especially in developing countries. The frequency and importance of emerging new pathogens have significant implications for therapy. We report a case of pneumonia caused by a very rare organism, Achromobacter denitrificans which was treated successfully with intravenous meropenem injections for 14 days. Review of available literature has documentation of isolation of Achromobacter xylosoxidans from endotracheal aspirate culture but this is probably the first case of pneumonia due to A. denitrificans.

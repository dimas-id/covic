Most of what we know today for interventional techniques for revascularization in patients with DF disease is derived from our knowledge on CLI in patients with PAD. There are today no dedicated randomized controlled trials on interventional treatment of DF. It is, however, clear that huge progress in interventional techniques has been obtained during the past decade. In most institutions, the nonsurgical option is the current first choice. As the aim of treatment is ulcer healing through temporary increase in blood flow, it is still unclear what the contribution of new stent and drug-eluting technologies will have on the clinical outcome of DF treatment. Long-term follow-up studies, dedicated to patients with an arterial DF problem, have to be performed before we can evaluate all these new technologies.

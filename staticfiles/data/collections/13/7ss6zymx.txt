Sepsis and septic shock are life-threatening conditions and remain an important medical problem, emphasizing the need to identify novel therapeutic approaches. Coagulation dysfunction, hypotension, disturbed microcirculation and multiorgan failure occur frequently. These severe conditions result from an overwhelming inflammatory response, induced by pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) released into the bloodstream. In the present study, we demonstrated that the synthetic Lipopolysaccharid (LPS)-binding peptide 19-2.5 interferes with the activation of the coagulation and contact system. Moreover, binding of LPS to high molecular weight kininogen (HK), one of the major LPS carrier in blood, could be prevented by the peptide. Thus, peptide 19-2.5 might represent a promising target in the treatment of endotoxemia and sepsis, not only by its anti-inflammatory potential, but also by the anticoagulant effect, together with its ability to prevent degradation of HK.

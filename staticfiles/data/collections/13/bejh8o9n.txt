High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is now a mainstay of respiratory care for the neonatal patient. In this chapter, we will define HFOV as those ventilators with a “true” active expiratory phase created by a piston or diaphragm. Jet ventilation and flow interrupters are discussed elsewhere in this book.

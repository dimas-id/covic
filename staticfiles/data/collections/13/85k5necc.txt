• We demonstrate five consecutive cases of predominantly lobar COVID-19-associated intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). • Patients were typically relatively young with a severe, prolonged inflammatory prodrome. • COVID-19-induced endotheliitis/endotheliopathy may underlie associated cerebrovascular events. • For the clinician, anticoagulation decisions must balance risk of thrombosis with risk of haemorrhage.

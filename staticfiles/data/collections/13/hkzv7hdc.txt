PURPOSE The aim of the present study was to report the clinical outcomes of endovascular treatment for extensive lower limb deep vein thrombosis with AngioJet rheolytic thrombectomy (ART) plus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) using a contralateral femoral approach. METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive ART+CDT treatments in 38 deep vein thrombosis patients (LET I-III, from September 2014 to March 2016) was performed. RESULTS The technical success rate was 100%. Complete lysis was achieved in 82% of LET III segments (calf veins), 87% of LET II segments (popliteal-femoral veins), and 90% of LET III segments (iliac veins). The best results were obtained in patients treated within seven days of symptom onset. During follow-up, well-preserved, competent femoral valves were observed in 86% of the patients, and recanalization of LET III, LET II, and LET I segments was achieved in 100%, 94%, and 91% of the patients, respectively. The post-thrombotic syndrome rate was 17% during a mean 20-month follow-up.

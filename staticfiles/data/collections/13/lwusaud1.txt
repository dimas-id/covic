INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) can achieve excellent weight loss, yet sleeve dilatation with concomitant weight regain proves to be a relevant issue. Hence, additional restriction might improve results after LSG. METHODS In a retrospective matched-pair analysis, 42 patients who underwent banded LSG (BLSG) using a MiniMizer® ring between January 2012 and October 2014 were analysed regarding weight loss, complications and comorbidity. Median follow-up was 3 years. Forty-two patients who had undergone conventional LSG were selected as matched pairs. RESULTS Mean preoperative BMI was 54.93 ± 7.42 kg/m2 for BLSG and 53.46 ± 6.69 kg/m2 for LSG (Mann-Whitney P = 0.540). Total weight loss (%TWL) was significantly greater in the BLSG group 3 years after surgery (BLSG 38.22% ± 7.26; n = 26 vs. LSG 32.69 ± 9.47; n = 26; P = 0.0154). Ring placement had no relevant impact on new-onset reflux (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0) but a tendency towards reflux improvement when reflux pre-existed (odds ratio 1.96). The major side effect of ring implantation was regurgitation with over 44% of patients presenting with regurgitation >1 per week (Fisher's exact test P = 0.0019, odds ratio 18.07). CONCLUSION BLSG is a safe procedure showing similar comorbidity to conventional LSG. However, BLSG leads to a higher rate of postoperative regurgitation. Weight loss is significantly improved 3 years after surgery. Hence, additional ring implantation might be an option for increased restriction in LSG surgery.

Isolated aortic valve diseases can lead to atrial fibrillation (AF) by causing left atrium pressure overload and enlargement. At present, most patients with preoperative AF and isolated aortic valve disease have undergone a Cox-maze IV procedure through a left atriotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass with aortic cross-clamping. Here, we describe a novel modified epicardial radiofrequency ablation procedure performed on a beating heart without aortic cross-clamping or opening the left atrium. This technique has proved to be safe and feasible, with good clinical outcomes. It may be useful in selecting the best ablation approaches for patients with AF and aortic valve disease.

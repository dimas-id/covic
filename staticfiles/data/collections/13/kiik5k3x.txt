BACKGROUND: At EU marketing authorisation, safety data for CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab) were limited, particularly in some indications, and uncommon adverse events (AEs) could not be evaluated among relatively small analysis populations. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the overall safety profile and incidence rate of AEs of special interest (AESIs), including serious infections and tuberculosis, in CT-P13-treated patients. METHODS: Data were pooled from six observational studies representing authorised indications of CT-P13 (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, adult and paediatric Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Patients were analysed by indication and treatment (patients who received CT-P13 or those who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13 ≤ 6 months prior to enrolment or during the study). RESULTS: Overall, 4393 patients were included (n = 3677 CT-P13 group; n = 716 switched group); 64.03% of patients had inflammatory bowel disease and 6.31% of patients were antidrug antibody positive. Overall, 32.94% and 9.58% of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious AEs, respectively. Across indications, TEAEs were more frequent with CT-P13 than with the switched group. Infections including tuberculosis were the most frequent serious AESI overall (2.48%) and by treatment group or indication. In total, 14 patients (0.32%) reported active tuberculosis. Overall incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) were 3.40 (2.788–4.096) for serious infections including tuberculosis and 0.44 (0.238–0.732) for active tuberculosis. Infusion-related reactions were the second most frequent AESI following infection including tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: The CT-P13 safety profile appears consistent with previous studies for CT-P13 and reference infliximab, supporting the favourable risk/benefit balance for CT-P13 treatment.

Four signature groups of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified using two-way clustering method in about twenty thousand high quality and high coverage SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Some frequently occurred SNVs predominate but are mutually exclusively presented in patients from different countries and areas. These major SNV signatures exhibited distinguished evolution patterns overtime. Although it was rare, our data indicated possible cross-infections with multiple groups of SNVs existed simultaneously in some patients, suggesting infections from different SARS-CoV-2 clades or potential re-combination of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Interestingly nucleotide substitutions among SARS-CoV-2 genomes tend to occur at the sites where one bat RaTG13 coronavirus sequences differ from Wuhan-Hu-1 genome, indicating the tolerance of mutations on those sites or suggesting that major viral strains might exist between Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 coronavirus.

Medical laboratory science students (MLSS), likewise health care workers (HCW), invariably get exposed to blood and body fluids (BBF) of patients. The degree of exposure of these students is even worsened due to their inexperience, which is usually revealed during their vocational training programme. This study therefore determined the prevalence of exposure to BBF and its risk factors among MLSS at the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS). A cross-sectional survey was employed using simple random sampling to enrol 178 students into the study. The study was conducted from February 1 to March 31, 2018, after the annual vocational training programme completed in August 2017. Self-administered questionnaires based on the objectives of the study were given out to participants to complete after their consent was sought. Descriptive data were reported as absolute number with percentages, whereas bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were done to describe relationship between risk factors and exposure to BBF. The study findings revealed that, out of 178 MLSS that participated, 90 (50.6%) experienced at least one exposure to BBF. Also, work experience before university education increased the chances of exposure to BBF (AOR = 7.37, 95% CI = 1.22–44.43, pvalue = 0.029) compared with those with no experience. In contrast, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) reduced the tendencies of exposure to BBF (AOR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20–0.88, p value = 0.023) compared with students who had insufficient PPE. The study showed high, 50.6% (95% CI: 43.0%–58.1%), exposure to BBF. Work history and sufficient PPE were the most significantly associated risk factors. In view of this, there is the need to promote training and education on exposure to BBF particularly among experienced students and also encourage health facilities to continue providing enough PPE for students during their annual obligatory vocational internship programmes.

We present a simple mesoscopic model for bacterial cross-talk between growing biofilm colonies. The simulation setup mimics a novel microfludic biofilm growth reactor which allows a 2D description. The model is a stiff quasilinear system of diffusion-reaction equations with simultaneously a super-diffusion singularity and a degeneracy (as in the porous medium equation) that leads to the formation of sharp interfaces with finite speed of propagation and gradient blow up. We use a finite volume method with arithmetic flux averaging, and a time adaptive stiff time integrator. We find that signal and nutrient transport between colonies can greatly control and limit biofilm response to induction signals, leading to spatially heterogeneous biofilm behavior.

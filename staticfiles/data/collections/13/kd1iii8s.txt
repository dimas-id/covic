OBJECTIVE Ischemia modified albumin has been shown to increase in ischemic situations, and has also been shown to increase in fetal cord blood in deliveries by cesarean section. The aim of this study is to reveal whether anesthesia has an impact on maternal and fetal cord ischemia modified albumin levels. METHODS Seventy two women with uncomplicated term pregnancies were randomized to spinal (n=37) or general anesthesia (n=35) groups. The blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and pulse rate of the patients were recorded during the procedure. Maternal blood samples of ischemia modified albumin (IMA) were taken 10 min from the start of the procedure. The fetal cord blood samples of IMA were taken immediately after birth. RESULTS Maternal (0.99 ± 0.19 vs. 0.80 ± 0.27) and fetal (1.00 ± 0.21 vs. 0.70 ± 0.26) IMA levels were significantly higher in the general anesthesia group. Fetal IMA levels were positively correlated with maternal gravidity (r=0.31; P=0.008), parity (r=0.25; P=0.028), and fetal birth weight (r=0.23, P=0.045). Also, as time from incision to delivery lengthens, fetal IMA levels increase (r=0.29, P=0.012). CONCLUSION Fetal cord ischemia modified albumin levels were higher in the general anesthesia group, therefore, it is proposed that regional anesthesia should be the preferred route of anesthesia for an elective cesarean section, at least until the impact of high fetal cord IMA levels are manifested.

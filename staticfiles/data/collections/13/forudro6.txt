In situ hybridization, (ISH) using a digoxigenin-antisense RNA-probe to detect chlamydial rRNA was applied to post mortem tissue of birds. The technique was optimized and validated using tissue from experimentally-infected chicken embryos. Tissue sections were also tested by immunohistochemistry (peroxidase-antiperoxidase reaction, PAP) for the presence of chlamydial antigen using a genus specific monoclonal antibody. In the chicken embryo tissue, ISH and PAP were comparably sensitive and specific (100% and 100%, respectively). ISH and PAP in general were correlated to microscopic lesions. For further comparison, ISH with PAP was applied retrospectively to tissues of 82 birds from which Chlamydia had been isolated, or which were suggestive of chlamydiosis. Using in situ hybridization 47 of 82 birds were found to be positive, and as were 23 of 82 birds with PAP. None of the ISH-only positive cases were found to be strongly positive. On the other hand, cases which were found positive with the ISH were also positive with other methods (PAP and isolation of Chlamydiae from chicken embryos). There was no close correlation between the positive cells and histological lesions. In spite of the higher sensitivity and specificity of the ISH, this technique is not suitable for routine diagnostic investigations. ISH is expensive, laborious, and time consuming.

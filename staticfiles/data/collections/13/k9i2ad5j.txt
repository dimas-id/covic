This study was aimed to determine the profiles of serum cytokines (IL‐1β, TNF‐α, IL‐4, IL‐5) and chemokines (MCP‐1: monocyte chemoattract protein‐1 and RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in individuals with an asthmatic versus a non‐asthmatic background with bacterial, viral or mixed acute respiratory infection. Asthmatic (n = 14) and non‐asthmatic (n = 29) patients with acute viral, bacterial or mixed (bacterial and viruses) respiratory infection were studied. Patients were also analysed as individuals with pneumonia or bronchitis. Healthy individuals with similar age and sex (n = 10) were used as controls. Cytokine/chemokine content in serum was determined by ELISA. Increased cytokine/chemokine concentration in asthmatic and non‐asthmatic patients was observed. However, higher concentrations of chemokines (MCP‐1 and RANTES) in asthmatic patients infected by viruses, bacteria or bacteria and viruses (mixed) than in non‐asthmatic patients were observed. In general, viral and mixed infections were better cytokine/chemokine inducers than bacterial infection. Cytokine/chemokine expression was similarly increased in both asthmatic and non‐asthmatic patients with pneumonia or bronchitis, except that RANTES remained at normal levels in bronchitis. Circulating cytokine profiles induced by acute viral, bacterial or mixed lung infection were not related to asthmatic background, except for chemokines that were increased in asthmatic status.

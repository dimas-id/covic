OBJECTIVES Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause adverse physiologic changes in fluid content within the brain, which may lead to changes in tissue elasticity (eg, stiffness). This study evaluated the ability of ultrasonic shear wave elastography to observe these changes in the brain after TBI in vivo. METHODS Mice and rats received a mild TBI or sham surgery and were imaged acutely or 24 hours after injury using shear wave elastography, and the hemispheric stiffness values were compared. RESULTS Stiffness values were consistent across brain hemispheres of sham TBI rodents. By 24 hours after TBI, relative brain tissue stiffness values for mice and rats each decreased ipsilaterally and increased contralaterally, both relative to each other and compared to sham TBI rodents (P < .05). The absolute tissue elasticity value increased for rats (P < .05) but not for mice. CONCLUSIONS Differences between intrahemispheric stiffness values of rodent brains by 24 hours after mild TBI may reflect the observed edema and hemorrhage ipsilateral to TBI and the known reduction of cerebral blood flow in both brain hemispheres. If these hypotheses hold true, ultrasonic shear wave elastography may offer a method for detecting adverse changes in fluid content within the brain after mild TBI.

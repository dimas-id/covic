The clinical course of COVID-19 presents a broad spectrum, being asymptomatic in some individuals while following a severe course and resulting in mortality in others. It is known that such factors as age and chronic diseases can result in a different clinical courses in individuals, however, variable clinical courses among the similar individuals in terms of age and chronic diseases are also seen. Other possible factors affecting the course of the disease that are mostly speculative or under investigation are genetic factors and the origin of transmission or possible subtype of novel coronavirus. Whether the source of transmission is important in the clinical course of the disease is unknown. A case series composed of seven individuals in a similar age group, with different lines of descent and different genetic structures, but who were infected from the same source is presented here. The similar and different clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of the cases residing in the same nursing home, who presented to the hospital altogether, were evaluated. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the source of transmission is influential in the clinical course of the disease.

This paper studies the rumor propagation model with heterogeneous networks in a multilingual environment. Firstly, a rumor propagation model with two language spreaders, in which the immunologic mechanism is considered in the ignorant, is proposed on heterogeneous networks. Secondly, the basic reproduction number and the dynamic behaviors are analyzed by using the next-generation matrix method and Lyapunov stability theory, respectively. Moreover, two control strategies are designed to effectively suppress the spread of the rumor. The one is continuous control strategy. By applying real-time control to the spreaders, the rumor spreading time can be greatly reduced and the rumor can die out in a short time. The other is event-triggered impulsive control strategy, which can effectively reduce the consumption of resources and ensure the extinction of the rumor. Finally, the correctness of theoretical analysis and the feasibility of control methods are verified by numerical simulations.

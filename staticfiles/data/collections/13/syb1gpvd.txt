Abstract Virus surveillance of wildlife populations is important for identifying, monitoring, and predicting the emergence of pathogens that pose a potential threat to animal and human health. Bats are identified as important wildlife hosts of many viruses capable of causing fatal human disease, including members of the henipaviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses and filoviruses. As global warming and habitat change are thought to impact upon pathogen transmission dynamics and increase the risk of spillover, virus surveillance in bat populations remains a significant component of efforts to improve the prediction and control of potential future disease outbreaks caused by bat-borne viruses. In this study we have developed two fluid bead array assays containing customized panels that target multiple bat-borne viruses. These assays detect up to 11 viral RNA's simultaneously in urine samples collected from wild bat populations in Australia and Bangladesh. The assays developed show high specificity for the target viruses and the analytical sensitivity compares favorably to qRT-PCR. These assays enhance the ability to monitor multi-pathogen dynamics and identify patterns of virus shedding from bat populations, thus informing key approaches to outbreak response and control.

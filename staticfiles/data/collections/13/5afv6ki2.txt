Polypeptides of the vaccinia virus envelope exposed on the surface were identified by means of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin as a surface tag. Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.

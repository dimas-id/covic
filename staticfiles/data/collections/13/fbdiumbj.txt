For an odd prime $p$, we determined the Brown-Peterson cohomology of $BPU_n$ in dimensions $-(2p-2)\leq i\leq 2p+2$, where $BPU_n$ is the classifying space of the projective unitary group $PU_n$. We construct a family of $p$-torsion classes $\eta_{p,k}\in BP^{2p^{k+1}+2}(BPU_n)$ for $p|n$ and $k\geq 0$ and identify their images under the Thom map with well understood cohomology classes in $H^*(BPU_n;\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$.

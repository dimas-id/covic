abstract: We generated a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype (VSV Δ G*SG) by replacing the envelope G gene with the GFP gene and complementing with spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS‐CoV in trans. The neutralization and infection blocking tests showed that the VSV Δ G*SG and SARS‐CoV reacted similarly to SARS‐CoV specific antiserum, suggesting the VSVΔ G*SG can be a safe replacement of the live SARS‐CoV for neutralization test and cell‐entry assay.

Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3) was detected in Shandong, China. One hundred and thirty‐two of 222 (59.46%) samples were PCV3 positive, while 52 of 132 (39.39%) samples were co‐infected with PCV2. There were no clinical signs of infection in either multiparous sows or live‐born infants. Two strains of PCV3 were indentified from natural stillborn foetuses. Phylogenetic analysis showed the two strains of PCV3 are 96% identical to the known PCV3/Pig/USA (KX778720.1, KX966193.1 and KX898030.1) and closely related to Barbel Circovirus. Further studies of the epidemiology of PCV3 and the co‐infection with PCV2 are needed.

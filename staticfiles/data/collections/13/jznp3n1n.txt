Abstract Recent studies have provided physicochemical and electron microscopic evidence for the existence of two distinct agents of posttransfusion non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis. One of these agents is chloroform-resistant and is not associated with the formation of unique ultrastructural structures in infected liver. The other agent is CHCl3-sensitive, induces the formation of characteristic hepatocyte cytoplasmic tubules, and interferes with concurrent HAV or HBV infection in experimentally inoculated chimpanzees. The tubule-forming agent (TFA) has also been shown to pass through an 80 nm capillary pore membrane filter, suggesting that it is a small enveloped (or lipid-containing) virus. The TFA can also be recovered from low titer (⩽ 105 infectious doses/ml) chronic-phase chimpanzee plasma by use of a multi-step purification procedure that assumes the agent is a small enveloped RNA virus with an approximate buoyant density of 1.24 g/cm3 and a sedimentation coefficient of 200–280 S. The apparent lack of nucleic acid homology between the NANB-TFA and HBV further suggests that the NANB-TFA is either Togavirus-like or belongs to another or as yet undefined class of RNA or DNA virus.

Due to the current pandemic, global shortage of reagents has drawn interest in developing alternatives to increase the number coronavirus tests. One such alternative is sample pooling. Here we compared commercial kits that are used in COVID-19 diagnostics, in terms of sensitivity and feasibility for use in pooling. We showed that pooling of up to 60 samples did not affect the efficiency of the kits. Also, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a more suitable target in pooled samples than the Envelope (E) protein. This approach could provide an easy method of screening large number of samples and help adjust different government regulations.

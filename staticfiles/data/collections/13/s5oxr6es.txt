BACKGROUND AND AIM: In patients with dermatologic disorders who are affected by new corona virus, we know little about course (underlying disease and new onset‐infection) and the most proper management strategies include both issues that are what this systematic review targets. METHOD: Databases of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Medscape and CEBD coronavirus dermatology resource of Nottingham University searched completely and initial 237 articles selected to further review and finally nine articles (including 12 patients) entered to this study. RESULT: from 12 patients with chronic underlying dermatologic disease treated with systemic therapies, only one patient required ICU admission, the others have been treated for mild‐ moderate symptoms with conventional therapies. The biologic or immunosuppressive/ Immunomodulator agents has been ceased during the course of disease. The course of COVID‐19 its management was as similar as normal populations. Their underlying dermatologic disease was exacerbating from mild to moderate. Their treatment has been continued as before, after the symptoms improved. CONCLUSION: Exacerbation of patients underlying dermatologic disease is mild‐ moderate. Discontinuing the treatment in the acute period of COVID and the restart after recovery may prevent severe recurrence in these patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

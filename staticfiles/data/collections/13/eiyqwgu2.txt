Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α/CCL3) is a chemotactic chemokine secreted by macrophages. It performs various biological functions, such as recruiting inflammatory cells, wound healing, inhibition of stem cells, and maintaining effector immune response. It activates bone resorption cells and directly induces bone destruction. Cells that secrete MIP-1α/CCL3 are increased at sites of inflammation and bone resorption. MIP-1α/CCL3 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases and conditions that exhibit bone resorption, such as periodontitis, multiple myeloma, Sjögren syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. Biological fluids from patients with these diseases exhibit elevated levels of MIP-1α/CCL3. This finding indicates that MIP-1[Formula: see text] /CCL3 protein may have diagnostic potential for the detection of several inflammatory diseases and conditions. This chapter discusses the biological functions of MIP-1α/CCL3; describes several diseases associated with MIP-1α/CCL3, particularly periodontitis; and delineates the potential application of MIP-1α/CCL3 as a biomarker.

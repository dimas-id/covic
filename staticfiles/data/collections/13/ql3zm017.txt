We have recently identified apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) as an endoribonuclease that cleaves c-myc mRNA in vitro and regulates c-myc mRNA levels and half-life in cells. This study was undertaken to further unravel the RNA-cleaving properties of APE1. Here, we show that APE1 cleaves RNA in the absence of divalent metal ions and, at 2 mM, Zn(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), or Co(2+) inhibited the endoribonuclease activity of APE1. APE1 is able to cleave CD44 mRNA, microRNAs (miR-21, miR-10b), and three RNA components of SARS-corona virus (orf1b, orf3, spike) suggesting that, when challenged, it can cleave any RNAs in vitro. APE1 does not cleave strong doublestranded regions of RNA and it has a strong preference for 3' of pyrimidine, especially towards UA, CA, and UG sites at single-stranded or weakly paired regions. It also cleaves RNA weakly at UC, CU, AC, and AU sites in single-stranded or weakly paired regions. Finally, we found that APE1 can reduce the ability of the Dicer enzyme to process premiRNAs in vitro. Overall, this study has revealed some previously unknown biochemical properties of APE1 which has implications for its role in vivo.

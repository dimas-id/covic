Described here is a severe case of community-acquired adenovirus pneumonia that occurred in a previously healthy 54-year-old male who was later determined to have stage A chronic lymphatic leukemia. The clinical presentation was consistent with that of atypical pneumonia. Testing with PCR revealed adenovirus in a bronchoalveolar lavage sample, while all other tests to determine a bacterial or virological etiology were negative. Further examination of the patient revealed the previously undiagnosed chronic lymphatic leukemia. Following treatment with human immunoglobulin and oxygen therapy with continuous positive airway pressure support the patient recovered from the pneumonia completely.

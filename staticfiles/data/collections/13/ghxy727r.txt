Abstract Background Lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a critical tool for evaluating patients with dyspnea in the emergency department (ED), including patients with suspected COVID-19. However, given the threat of nosocomial disease spread, the use of ultrasound is no longer risk-free. Objective of the Review: Here, we review the lung POCUS findings in patients with COVID-19. In doing so we present a scanning protocol for lung POCUS in COVID-19 which maximizes clinical utility and provider safety. Discussion In COVID-19 lung, POCUS findings are predominatly located in the posterior and lateral lung zones bilaterally. A 6-zone scanning protocol which prioritizes obtaining images in these locations optimizes provider positioning, and minimizes time spent scanning which can reduce risk to health care workers performing POCUS. Conclusions Lung POCUS can offer valuable clinical data when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Scanning protocols such as that presented here which target clinical utility and decreased nosocomial disease spread must be prioritized.

The sequence of the MHV-A 59 non-structural gene 4 (ns 4) reveals two open reading frames. The upstream ORF potentially encodes a 19 amino acid (2.2 kDa) polypeptide and the downstream ORF potentially encodes a 106 amino acid (11.7 kDa) polypeptide. This is in contrast to MHV-JHM gene 4 which expresses a 15 kDa protein. Cell free translation of a synthetic mRNA containing both ORFs of MHV-A 59 ns 4 results in the synthesis of a 2.2 kDa poylpeptide; the predicted 11.7 kDa product of the MHV-A 59 downstream ORF is not detected during cell free translation nor in infected cells. These results add to the recent data suggesting that expression of some of the ns proteins of MHV is not necessary for efficient growth in tissue culture.

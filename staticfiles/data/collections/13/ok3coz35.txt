SYMPTOMS: A 40 year old, disoriented, HIV- and Hepatitis B positive male patient was admitted with 40.3 °C. Clinically he presented a sinustachycardia (160/min) and hypotension (70/60 mmHg). INVESTIGATIONS/DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory analyses showed elevated infection parameters, azotemia, proteinuria and thrombopenia. CD(4+)T-helper cells: 320/µl (32 %), HIV RNA: < 40 copies/ml, Hepatitis B DNA: 20800 copies/ml. Hantavirus serology (immunofluorescence antibody assay): 1:2048; serotype Puumala. TREATMENT/COURSE: An early-goal-directed therapy and antibiotic treatment with Piperacillin and Tazobactam was initiated. The patient developed a bipulmonal infiltrate and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ) requiring tracheal intubation, as well as a triad of fever, renal failure and profound hemorrhagic symptoms. This led to the diagnosis of the Puumala infection. Due to the parallel HIV- and Hepatits B infection an antiretroviral therapy was initiated. CONCLUSION: In summary the Puumala infection bears the potential for a severe multi-organ failure, which is not typical for this usually benign infection.

PURPOSE The safety of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has been proven in well-selected patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether SILC can be offered to all patients with any indication for cholecystectomy. METHODS A total of 173 consecutive SILCs were performed between January 2010 and November 2012 with no exclusion criteria. Demographic data, operative, and postoperative outcomes were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Patients with acute cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis had longer operative times and a higher conversion to 4-port cholecystectomy than patients with biliary colic. Similar relationships were seen when comparing patients with obesity to nonobese patients. There were no differences in complication rates between the groups. CONCLUSIONS SILC can be safely offered to patients with a wide spectrum of biliary disease with the understanding that this may result in increased operative times and a higher likelihood of conversion to multiport laparoscopy.

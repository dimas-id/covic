The purpose of this study was to compare the feasibility, blood loss, duration of surgery and complications between patients in whom both uterine arteries were ligated by surgical clips and cut using a 5-mm ligature at the beginning of total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and patients in whom uterine arteries were not ligated at the beginning of TLH. In our prospective study, a total of 60 women underwent TLH. Uterine artery ligation (UAL) was done at the beginning of the procedure. Women were divided into TLH + UAL (n = 30) and TLH (n = 30) groups. In TLH group, TLH was done without ligating the uterine arteries at the beginning of the procedure. In TLH + UAL group, TLH was done with ligation of both uterine arteries at the beginning of the procedure. The mean operating time was longer for the TLH group (99.16 ± 7.01) than TLH + UAL group (63.27 ± 7.16). The median total blood loss was higher in TLH group (109.38 ± 33.03 mL) than TLH + UAL group (47.50 ± 8.12 mL). UAL at the beginning of TLH is a technically feasible procedure. It reduces the total blood loss and decreases the time taken for the procedure and length of hospital stay.

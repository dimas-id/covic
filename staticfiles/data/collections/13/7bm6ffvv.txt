Abstract For epidemic control, rapid identification and characterization of the responsible unknown agent are crucial. To address this critical question, a method was developed for virus discovery based on a flexible nested-PCR subtraction hybridization. As a positive control, we used hepatitis C virus as a hypothetical unrecognized virus and “discover” it in the sample. Using template-switching universal long-PCR to produce large quantities of cDNA, our nested-PCR-based subtractive hybridization coupled with a single-strand deletion technology removed most of the common cDNA. Following subtraction hybridization, a cDNA library was constructed and displayed by differential reverse dot blot hybridization. This new genomic subtraction hybridization method will be ideally suited to identify rapidly any previously unrecognized viral agent.

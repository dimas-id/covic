Acute liver failure (ALF) is uncommon in the United States, but presents acutely and catastrophically, often with deadly consequences. Hepatic encephalopathy, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and intracranial hemorrhage due to coagulopathy are common occurrences in patients with ALF. Appropriate management of multi-system organ failure and neurological complications are essential in bridging patients to transplant and ensuring satisfactory outcomes.

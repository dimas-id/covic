BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a promising technique with regard to reducing postoperative pain, decreasing complications, and improving cosmesis. METHODS Between September 2008 and April 2009, 20 patients underwent cholecystectomy via SILS. The umblicus was the access point of entry to the abdomen for all the patients. RESULTS Of the 20 cholecystectomies, 19 were performed with SILS. Failure of trocar insertion was the reason for conversion with the first patient. No complications or mortalities were associated with the technique. The mean operating time was 94 min. CONCLUSION The use of SILS for cholecystectomy is safe and feasible with reasonable operation times.

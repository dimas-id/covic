As otolaryngologists, we identify as subspecialists and fellowship-trained surgeons and may even identify as "super-subspecialists." The likelihood of being redeployed and drawing from knowledge learned during our postgraduate year 1 training seemed exceedingly unlikely until physician resources became scarce in some health care systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. More now than ever, it is evident that our broad training is valuable in helping patients and allowing the otolaryngologist to meaningfully contribute to the larger health care community, especially while the majority (70%-95%) of elective care is delayed. With our skill set, otolaryngologists are poised to support various aspects of hospital wards, intensive care units, emergency departments, and beyond.

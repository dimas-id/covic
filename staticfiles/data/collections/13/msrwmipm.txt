In a household study, loss of taste and/or smell was the fourth most reported symptom (26/42; 62%) among COVID-19 case-patients and had the highest positive predictive value (83%; 95% CI: 55-95%) among household contacts. Olfactory and taste dysfunctions should be considered for COVID-19 case identification and testing prioritization.

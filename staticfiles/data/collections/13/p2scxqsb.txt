So far, available evidence suggests that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are not at greater risk for developing COVID-19 infection. In regard to patients with IBD remission: 5-aminosalycylates (5-ASAs) do not increase the risk for infection and should be continued. There is no need to suspend them or lower the dose. Immunomodulating drugs, such as thiopurines and methotrexate, should be continued, without modifying doses (even in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection). No type of biologic therapy should be suspended, unless there are signs of COVID-19. Regarding patients with IBD activity: the oral and/or topical 5-ASA dose should be optimized in cases of disease relapse. Budesonide MMX should be considered in cases of mild-to-moderate activity, to avoid systemic steroid use. Systemic steroids should be avoided whenever possible because doses above 20mg per day have an immunosuppressive effect, which could increase susceptibility to any type of infection, including COVID-19. The combined use of thiopurines with steroids and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibodies should also be avoided because those combinations can increase the risk for infections, including COVID-19. Finally, biologic treatment with anti-TNF-alpha agents or any other mechanism of action, such as anti-integrins or anti-interleukins, should be suspended if patients become infected with SARS-CoV-2. The drugs can be restarted once the infectious process is resolved.

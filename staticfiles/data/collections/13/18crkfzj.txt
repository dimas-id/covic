Public health events caused by viruses pose a significant risk to humans worldwide. From December 2019 till now, the rampant novel 2019 coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) has hugely impacted China and over world. Regarding a commendable means of protection, mask technology is relatively mature, though most of the masks cannot effectively resist the viral infections. The key material of the mask is a non-woven material, which makes the barrier of virus through filtration. Due to the lack of the ability to kill the viruses, masks are prone to cross-infection and become an additional source of infection after being discarded. If the filteration and antiviral effects can be simultaneously integrated into the mask, it will be more effcient, work for a longer time and create less difficulty in post-treatment. This mini-review presents the advances in antiviral materials, different mechanisms of their activity, and their potential applications in personal protective fabrics. Furthermore, the article addresses the future challenges and directions of mask technology.

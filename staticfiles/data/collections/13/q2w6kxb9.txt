While impressive clinical responses have been observed using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19+ hematologic malignancies, limited clinical benefit has been observed using CAR T cells for a variety of solid tumors. Results of clinical studies have highlighted several obstacles which CAR T cells face in the context of solid tumors, including insufficient homing to tumor sites, lack of expansion and persistence, encountering a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and heterogeneous antigen expression. In this review, we review clinical outcomes and discuss strategies to improve the antitumor activity of CAR T cells for solid tumors.

COVID‐19 can affect the hematopoietic system. Thrombocytopenia at admission was prevalent, while late‐phase or delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia (occurred 14 days after symptom onset) is obscure. This retrospective single‐center study screened 450 COVID‐19 patients and enrolled 271 patients at the Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 25th to March 9th, 2020. COVID‐19 associated delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia occurred in 11.8% percent of enrolling patients. The delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia in COVID‐19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission. The delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher mortality rate. Delayed‐phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with B cell percentages. We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia, showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes. We speculated that immune mediated platelet destruction might account for the delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia in a group of patients. Besides, clinicians need to pay attention to the delayed‐phase thrombocytopenia especially at 3‐4 weeks after symptom onset.

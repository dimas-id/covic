Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery to treat esophageal achalasia. During POEM, cardiovascular dynamics can be impaired by capnoperitoneum, capnomediastinum, and systemic carbon dioxide accumulation. We systematically investigated changes in cardiovascular dynamics during POEM. We included 31 patients having POEM in this single-center prospective observational study. Before and every 5 min during POEM we measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) using non-invasive finger cuff-derived pulse wave analysis. During POEM, the median MAP was higher than the median baseline MAP of 77 (67;86) mmHg. HR (median at baseline: 67 (60;72) bpm), CI (2.8 (2.5;3.2) L/min/m2), SVI (42 (34;51) mL/m2), and SVRI (1994 (1652; 2559) dyn × s × cm-5 × m-2) remained stable during POEM. Mixed model-derived 95% confidence limits of hemodynamic variables during POEM were 72 to 106 mmHg for MAP, 65 to 79 bpm for HR, 2.7 to 3.3 L/min/m2 for CI, 37 and 46 mL/m2 for SVI, and 1856 and 2954 dyn × s × cm-5 × m-2 for SVRI. POEM is a safe procedure with regard to cardiovascular dynamics as it does not markedly impair MAP, HR, CI, SVI, or SVRI.

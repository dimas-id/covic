INTRODUCTION This video describes a modified single-incision laparoscopic approach for adjustable gastric band placement. METHOD The patient was a 28-year-old female with a BMI of 48.75 with no prior surgery but with numerous comorbidities. With the patient placed in a split-leg position and in steep reverse Trendelenburg, a 12-mm optical trocar is placed 12 cm distal to the xiphoid process in the left paramedian location. A Nathanson liver retractor is placed through a midepigastric 5-mm incision. Two 5-mm low-profile trocars are placed next to the 12-mm trocar through separate incisions (this maintains stability of each cannula) and a 5-mm 45 Â° laparoscope is used. Using an automated suturing device, a stay suture is placed high on the fundus and externalized for retraction. An articulating band passer dissects the phrenogastric attachments at the angle of His. The 12-mm port is removed and the gastric band is inserted. The GE junction fat pad is excised and the Pars Flaccida membrane is divided using conventional instruments. A second traction suture is placed to retract the lesser curve fat and right crus fat pad. A peritoneal bite is also taken in the left lateral subcostal area such that when this suture is externalized, it acts as a pulley. An articulating 5-mm grasper is used to develop the retrogastric tunnel. Then the band is fed into position and its buckle is locked. Three interrupted sutures are placed to create an anterior gastric plication and a fourth antislippage suture is placed below the band along the lesser curve. The band tubing is externalized and the port is implanted by joining the three working trocar incisions into a single 4.5-cm incision. RESULTS The patient did well postoperatively with no complications. CONCLUSIONS A modified single incision approach for laparoscopic gastric band placement is feasible and provides patients with improved cosmesis.

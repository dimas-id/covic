Genetic polymorphisms within the IFNL3/IFNL4 genomic region, which encodes type III interferons, have been strongly associated with impaired clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We hypothesized that type III interferons might be important for the immune response to other pathogens as well. In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections using information for 30,626 clinic visits from birth through up to 5 years of follow-up. Genetic polymorphisms IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 that functionally affect type III interferons were genotyped with TaqMan assays. For both genetic variants and each infection, we evaluated time-to-first episode and calculated odds ratios (ORs) for the risk of an infection episode during follow-up, controlling for relevant covariates. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-λ4-Null), each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele was associated with an earlier first episode of a gastrointestinal infection (p=0.003) and respiratory infection (p=0.045). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with each copy of the rs368234815-dG allele – for gastrointestinal infections (OR=1.53, 95%CI (1.13-2.07), p=0.005) and malaria (OR=1.30, 95%CI (1.02-1.65), p=0.033). IFNL4-rs368234815 and IFNL3-rs4803217 were in moderate linkage disequilibrium in this population (r2=0.78), and all the associations for rs4803217 were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815, implicating IFN-λ4 and not IFN-λ3 as the primary cause of these associations. We conclude that the ability to produce IFN-λ4 may have broad health-related implications by negatively affecting the immune response and clinical outcomes of several common infections.

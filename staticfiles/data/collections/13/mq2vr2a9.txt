OBJECTIVE To investigate excretion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus RNA (SARS-CoV) in stool of SARS patients. METHODS SARS-CoV RNA was detected in stool specimens with fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reactions (FQ-PCR) in 101 SARS patients on the 10 to 55 days after onset, 27 non-SARS patients and 400 individuals with health check-up. RESULTS SARS-CoV RNA was positive in stool specimens by FQ-PCR in 58 of 101 SARS patients (57.4%), and all negative in 27 non-SARS patients and 400 healthy individuals. Positive rate of SARS-CoV RNA was 100% (8/8), 67.7% (21/31), 47.4% (27/57) and 40.0% (2/5) on the 10 - 19, 20 - 29, 30 - 39 and 40 - 55 days after onset of fever, respectively, with values of logarithm of SARS-CoV RNA load of 6.06 +/- 2.05, 4.51 +/- 1.23, 3.82 +/- 1.44 and 3.57 +/- 1.25, respectively. CONCLUSION Positive rate and load of SARS-CoV RNA in stool of SARS patients was the highest at their acute phase, and decreased with the extension of its course.

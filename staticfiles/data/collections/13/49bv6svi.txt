This case report describes the disease progression of a male cat with pericardial effusion. Clinical signs (dyspnea, lethargy, and weakness) started very acutely. The initial laboratory profile showed only an increase in alanine aminotransferase enzyme activity. Diagnostic imaging revealed pericardial effusion. Effusion analysis showed a Rivalta-positive, modified transudate. Detection of feline coronavirus antigen in macrophages was negative. General condition and laboratory parameters dramatically worsened within seven days. Therefore, the owners decided to euthanize the cat. Even if effusion variables are macroscopically and microscopically suspicious for FIP, a definitive diagnosis of FIP could only be made by histology (including immunhistochemical staining).

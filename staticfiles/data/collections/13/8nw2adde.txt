The COVID-19 crisis has caused many issues across healthcare. In surgery, many operations have been cancelled with some surgeons losing their regular operating lists. During this time, technical expertise and decision making can deteriorate. In aviation after a prolonged period of absence from flying, this deficit in keeping skills and thinking up to date is known as being "out of currency" or "not current". Although aviation and healthcare cannot be compared, numerous human factors concepts are applicable to both. In this article, we explore the likely impact of potentially prolonged absences in operating on surgical skills and psyche, and introduce the concept of a Surgical Skills Currency Barometer. We also discuss a "task-o-meter" thought experiment, and suggest practices which could be adopted to help protect surgeon workload from exceeding surgical capability when returning to operating following a period of prolonged absence.

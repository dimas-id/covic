Ferret polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation. Using a 50% Percoll solution (density=1.066), PMNs and PBMCs were successfully isolated after centrifugation; the purities of the PMNs and PBMCs were 94.2% and 95.6%, respectively. To evaluate the function of isolated ferret PMNs, we measured the superoxide generation with a MCLA-dependent chemiluminescence assay. The isolated ferret PMNs responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) with kinetics similar to that of human PMNs. The ferret PMNs did not respond to N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), unlike human PMNs, which rapidly responded. Thus, authors established a method for the rapid separation of highly purified populations of functional PMNs from the whole blood of ferrets.

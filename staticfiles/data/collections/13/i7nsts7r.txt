We have proposed a new form of growth rate for population ecology. Generally, the growth rate is dependent on the size of the population at that particular epoch. We have introduced an alternative time-dependent form of growth rate. This form satisfies essential conditions to represent population growth and can be an alternative form for growth models to analyze population dynamics. We have employed the generalized Richards model as a guideline to compare our results. Further, we have applied our model in the case of epidemics. To check the efficacy of our model, we have verified the 2003 SARS data. This model has estimated the final epidemic size with good accuracy. Thereafter, we intend to describe the present COVID-2019 pandemic. We have performed our analysis with data for Italy, Spain, and Germany. Following, we have tried to predict the number of COVID-19 cases and the turning point for the USA, UK, and India.

Objectives We present a new surgery based on the round ligament anatomy that is called laparoscopic abdominopexy, which uses a synthetic mesh without fixation at any pelvic point. The aim of this study is to provide a step-by-step description of the laparoscopic abdominopexy technique and present the first anatomical and functional results of the procedure. Methods This prospective cohort study included patients with apical and anterior vaginal prolapse who were subjected to laparoscopic abdominopexy. Before and after surgery, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) scale, Overactive Bladder Questionnaire-Short Form (OABq-SF), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) were used to evaluate the vaginal prolapse stage, storage, and sexual symptoms, respectively. The surgical technique is described step by step. Results Twenty patients were included with follow-up times between 6 and 25 months. The mean surgical time was 78.4 minutes. A statistically significant improvement was observed in the Aa (P ≤ 10-5), Ba (P ≤ 10-5), C (P = 5 × 10-5), D (P = .002) and tvl (P = .02) POP-Q points and in OABq-SF (22.2%; P = .02). Successful surgery was observed in 100% of patients for the apical compartment and 90% of patients for the anterior compartment. Conclusion Laparoscopic abdominopexy is a quick, safe, and reproducible surgical technique with beneficial anatomical and functional results that preserve the pelvic floor anatomy.

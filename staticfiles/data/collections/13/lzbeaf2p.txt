I have read with interest the review by Ludvigsson on the role of children as transmitters of the new coronavirus (SARS‐COV‐2). An in‐depth review of the current literature focused on 40 published articles and 7 non‐peer reviewed papers(1). All the papers included have been done under lockdown conditions. As a consequence, we should not ignore a main bias of this review(1). The main conclusion we can draw now is that under confined conditions, children are not the main drivers of the COVID‐19 pandemic. And “Confined" is not a normal situation.

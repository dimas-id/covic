The COVID-19 pandemic has aroused a level of anxiety and uncertainty that spans demographics and diagnoses. Because the coronavirus is a novel variant, the expert scientific community presents to the public as uncertain and inconsistent in information and ways to deal with potential infection, which creates disbelief and uncertainty. The most consistent recommendation is physical distancing and self-imposed isolation to reduce the spread. However, such isolation also adds to individual and community distress. This column focuses on the neurobiological explanations for anxiety, complications to pre-existing psychiatric disorders, sub diagnostic states of stress and anxiety generally and with health care providers, and pharmacological and nonpharmacological ways of addressing this anxiety.

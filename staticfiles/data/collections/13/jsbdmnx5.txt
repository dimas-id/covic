The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today recommended a dramatic shift in how it implements regulations that control whether laboratories can use diagnostic kits created in-house to test for infections of coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) “We issued a policy this morning that allows us to have a lot of flexibility around the development of diagnostic tests,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn at a White House briefing with President Donald Trump this afternoon “We expect this policy to have a significant impact ” The change could greatly expand the number of laboratories able to do coronavirus testing The U S government has come under severe criticism for not providing nearly enough tests needed to understand the extent of spread in the population A test kit produced and distributed by the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was shelved after state and local lab trying it out discovered that it contained a faulty reagent As a result, many labs that have the capability to test themselves have not been allowed to do so The new recommendations focus on “high-complexity testing laboratories” that are certified under federal rules known as Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments This group of facilities includes many hospital labs, like the one that epidemiologist Michael Mina works at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston “Essentially it’s opening up a clear and concise avenue for labs like the one at Brigham and Women’s,” says Mina “It’s what I’ve been advocating for a month now ”

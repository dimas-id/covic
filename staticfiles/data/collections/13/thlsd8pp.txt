Abstract Transport networks are comprised of gateway and hub cities where goods are transshipped between transport modes along established trade corridors. The economics of gateways and hubs depends on the competitiveness of their trade corridors. Trade corridor routes are determined by geophysical features, political borders, proximity to markets, and investment in transportation infrastructure. The advantages of location can be altered by changes in transportation and communications technologies that favor some locations at the expense of others. Over time, hierarchies of hub and gateway cities have formed based on their trade of goods and increasingly on the services they provide. This chapter sets out a framework to analyze the evolution of transport networks and nodes where transshipments occur.

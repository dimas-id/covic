The diagnosis of the peripheral lung lesion has been a long-standing clinical challenge--balancing accuracy with patient safety. With recent data revealing mortality benefits with lung cancer screening via low-dose computed tomography, now more than ever, clinicians will be challenged with the task of providing the means to provide a safe and minimally invasive method of obtaining accurate tissue diagnostics for the pulmonary nodule. In this review, we present available technologies to aid clinicians in attempts at minimally invasive techniques and the data supporting their use. In addition, we review novel tools under investigation that may further increase yield and provide additional benefit in obtaining an early diagnosis of lung cancer.

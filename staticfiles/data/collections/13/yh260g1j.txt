Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be a rapidly fatal disease. Current treatment in adults is extrapolated from the HLH-2004 protocol that specifies a regimen of etoposide, dexamethasone and cyclosporine. However, HLH presents as a spectrum of disease severity. A therapeutic challenge arises for milder cases where the harms of potent chemotherapy such as etoposide may outweigh its benefit. We present a case of an adult with HLH who developed significant pancytopenia but was otherwise not critically ill and who responded to treatment with a chemotherapy-sparing approach consisting of intravenous immunoglobulins and corticosteroids alone. The case illustrates that tailored therapy may allow effective treatment of the disorder while minimising therapy-related toxicities.

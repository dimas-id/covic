Abstract The foundations of the science of medical virology are intertwined with the other life sciences, particularly microbiology and infectious diseases. Medical virology has a relatively brief history, spanning just over a century, but it is crowded with intriguing discoveries, stories of immense personal courage and numerous practical applications, many of which have had an overwhelmingly positive benefit on humankind. Its origins involved the replacement of centuries-old beliefs and theories with discoveries borne out of rigorous scientific investigation. Targeted prevention and control strategies could only be developed and implemented once the concept of the specificity of disease causation had been accepted, namely that infectious diseases are caused not by some common miasma (a mysteriously poisonous substance), but rather by specific agents. In a wider sense, the microbial sciences have played a pivotal role in the development of medical thought, particularly in applying scientific rigor in understanding pathological processes. Advances in understanding of infectious agents have led to improvements in human health and well-being that arguably have exceeded the contribution of any other branch of science. Indeed, many workers in this field have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their achievements.

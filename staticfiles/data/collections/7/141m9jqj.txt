PURPOSE We conducted this randomized trial to compare the LigaSure Vessel Sealing System with conventional methods in gastrointestinal carcinoma surgery at five specialty cancer hospitals. METHODS Patients with resectable stomach or colorectal cancers were randomized to the LigaSure (n = 100) or conventional surgery (n = 74) groups according to sealed envelopes. The operative data were compared. RESULTS There were no significant differences in operating times, blood loss, postoperative complications, or hospital stay. However, at the hospital where most of the procedures took place, the LigaSure was associated with a shorter operating time (173 ± 43 min for gastric carcinoma and 157 ± 43 min for colorectal carcinoma vs 211 ± 55 min and 202 ± 55 min for conventional surgery; P = 0.0046 and P = 0.0200, respectively) and less blood loss (300 ± 196 ml and 150 ± 133 ml, respectively, vs 453 ± 387 ml and 382 ± 444 ml; P = 0.0482 and P = 0.0465, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The LigaSure is safe for both gastric and colorectal cancer surgery with extended lymph node dissection. Used effectively, the device appears to reduce operating times and blood loss, although this requires confirmation in a larger series.

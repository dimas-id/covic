OBJECTIVE To report our experience with a modified procedure for total laparoscopic hysterectomy based on a retrograde and retroperitoneal technique. This surgical approach is analyzed on a consecutive series of patients in a community hospital and theoretical educational advantages are proposed. STUDY DESIGN All patients undergoing hysterectomy from January 2012 to April 2013 were included in the study. A detailed description of the technique is given. As main outcome measures we evaluated: the number and rate of patients excluded from laparoscopic approach, the rate of late complications need readmission, the rate of transfusions, the rate of conversion to laparotomy and the number of minor complications. The main concern of the study was ureteral complications. RESULTS Overall 174 patients underwent hysterectomy in our unit. The rate of patients submitted to laparoscopic hysterectomy was 97.5%. The number of complications needing re-admission was three (2%). The rate of conversion was 2.7%. In the study period, two (1.2%) ureteral complications were observed (late fistulae). There were four bladder lesions but the patients were released on the same day as the patients with no lesion. CONCLUSIONS Opening the retroperitoneum allows rapid control of the main uterine vessels by coagulation, and constant checks on the ureter. Difficult benign situations can be managed. Even in a non-referral center about 94% of hysterectomies can be performed by laparoscopic surgery. This approach is helpful and may be reproducible in gynecological procedures.

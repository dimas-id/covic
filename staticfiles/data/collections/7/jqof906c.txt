The viral spike protein is the main surface antigen of the coronavirus, and it could be useful in the research of clinical diagnosis, SARS vaccine and the structure biology.According to the analysis of the main antigen of the SARS spike protein, 5 fragments of the whole spike gene were cloned, and ligated to the vector pNMT1. Through electroporation transformantion to TCP1, the recombinant S. pombe strains capable of expressing the 5 fragments were constructed. SDS-PAGE or Western blot analysis of the induced expression products demonstrated that the 5 recombinant proteins were expressed in the fission yeast respectively.

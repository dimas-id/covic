Functional protein microarrays were developed as a high-throughput tool to overcome the limitations of DNA microarrays and to provide a versatile platform for protein functional analyses. Recent years have witnessed tremendous growth in the use of protein microarrays, particularly functional protein microarrays, to address important questions in the field of clinical proteomics. In this review, we will summarize some of the most innovative and exciting recent applications of protein microarrays in clinical proteomics, including biomarker identification, pathogen-host interactions, and cancer biology.

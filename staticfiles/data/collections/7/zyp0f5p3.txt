CONTEXT No defined pre-treatment factors are able to predict the response to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (AFTN). OBJECTIVE Primary endpoint was to evaluate the success rate of RFA to restore euthyroidism in a cohort of adult patients with small solitary AFTN compared with medium-sized nodules. Secondary endpoints included nodule volume reduction and rate of conversion from hot nodules to cold using scintiscan. METHODS This was a 24-month prospective monocentric open parallel-group trial. Twenty-nine patients with AFTN were divided into two groups based on thyroid volume: 15 patients with small nodules (<12 mL) in group A and 14 patients with medium nodules (>12 mL) in group B. All patients underwent a single session of RFA and were clinically, biochemically, and morphologically evaluated at baseline and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. RESULTS After RFA, there was greater nodule volume reduction in group A compared with group B (p < 0.001 for each follow-up point). In group A, there was a greater increase in TSH levels than in group B at 6 (p = 0.01), 12 (p = 0.005), and 24 months (p < 0.001). At 24 months, the rate of responders was greater in group A than in group B (86 vs. 45%; p < 0.001). In group A, 86% of nodules converted from hot to cold compared with 18% in group B (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A single session of RFA was effective in restoring euthyroidism in patients with small AFTNs. Nodule volume seems to be a significant predictive factor of the efficacy of RFA in treating AFTN.

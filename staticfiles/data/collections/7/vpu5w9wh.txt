Summary treeheatr is an R package for creating interpretable decision tree visualizations with the data represented as a heatmap at the tree’s leaf nodes. The integrated presentation of the tree structure along with an overview of the data efficiently illustrates how the tree nodes split up the feature space and how well the tree model performs. This visualization can also be examined in depth to uncover the correlation structure in the data and importance of each feature in predicting the outcome. Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, treeheatr can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students’ understanding of a simple decision tree model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods. Availability The treeheatr package is freely available under the permissive MIT license at https://trang1618.github.io/treeheatr and https://cran.r-project.org/package=treeheatr. It comes with a detailed vignette that is automatically built with GitHub Actions continuous integration. Contact ttle@pennmedicine.upenn.edu

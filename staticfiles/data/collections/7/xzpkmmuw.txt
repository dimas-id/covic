Abstract This chapter describes the multiple stages present during adolescence and the importance of animals in the lives of adolescents. From the ages of 10–25, adolescents and the role that their pets play in each other’s lives change dramatically. Here, we present three adolescent stages and the value of relationships adolescents have with their pets during these distinct stages. How studies have looked at ways pets influence or impact an adolescent’s life will be explored. The chapter also looks more specifically at a pet’s impact on physical health, social-emotional development, and socialization during the adolescence. We examine specific populations of adolescents, such as college students, rural adolescents, homeless adolescents, at-risk adolescents including adolescents who are suicidal, adolescents participating in canine-assisted therapy, and how their pet’s aide the adolescent. Lastly, experiences from several adolescents are provided.

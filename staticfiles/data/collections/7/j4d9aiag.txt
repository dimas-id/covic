Schwannomas of the large intestine are relatively rare. Here, we present a case of schwannoma of the cecum in a 59-year-old woman that was successfully resected by laparoscopic wedge resection. In a medical checkup, a colonoscopy revealed a 2 cm submucosal lesion, without mucosal changes, located in the cecum wall contralateral to Bauhin's valve. Abdominal contrast CT and contrast MRI indicated a smooth-surfaced, semi-round tumor of about 2 cm that gave an enhanced homogeneous signal in the cecum. Laparoscopic wedge resection was performed after the diagnosis of benign submucosal tumor. The lesion was 2.5 Ã— 2.0 cm, was histologically composed of spindle neoplastic cells arranged in cords, was positive for S-100 and vimentin, and was diagnosed as schwannoma. The details of this case are reported herein and focus on the successful application of laparoscopic wedge resection for treatment of the colonic submucosal lesion.

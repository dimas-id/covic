Several US federal agencies are taking all their grant review panels online for the first time in response to the COVID-19 pandemic The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation are going exclusively online for their grant review meetings, at least for now So far, the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review, which oversees most grant review at the agency, has scheduled 281 online panels through August The agency expects that number to rise to almost 500 The agency was already running almost half of its meetings online, especially smaller ones, so “we’ve been able to quickly transition to all virtual,” says spokesperson Kristin Kramer At the NSF, the chemistry division has run meetings fully or partially online for 7 or 8 years Doing so allows a more diverse panel to participate, including those with travel, teaching, or family obligations or those on the West Coast, says Carol Bessel,

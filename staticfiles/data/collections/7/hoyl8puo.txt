BACKGROUND Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare ulcerating skin disease of unknown etiology, making its coincidence with orthopedic trauma a rare challenge. Patients are at risk of progression of the existing lesions and development of new lesions upon skin injury when surgical procedures are performed. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of disease unrelated surgery during active pyoderma gangrenosum. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of femoral neck fracture in a Caucasian patient with concurrent pyoderma gangrenosum localized in the axilla. Hemiarthroplasty was safely performed after disease activity was reduced with systemic corticosteroids. Tissue-protective wound closure was used together with perioperative corticosteroids and antibiotics. No signs of pyoderma gangrenosum developed at the surgical wound site, and the axillary lesions showed constant improvement until healing with scar tissue. CONCLUSIONS In our patient, the preoperative steroid treatment, perioperative antibiotics, and soft tissue protective surgical technique led to successful management of this rare coincidence.

The imperative to cooperate with China to solve environmental challenges is now clear. In recent decades, China has perhaps understandably depended on fossil fuels to promote industrialization and economic growth; however, this has increased carbon emissions and air pollutants in major urban areas. Air pollutants like ozone, volatile organic compounds, nitrous oxides and particulate matter remain one of the greatest public health challenges. China in solving its own problems can also then be in a strong position to help other countries reduce their own emissions, creating an important dynamic for solving global challenges.

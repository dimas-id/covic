INTRODUCTION When gastric cancer or carcinoid patients have coexisting diseases such as duodenal adenoma, FAP, or Crohn's disease, periodic observation of the duodenum is necessary. METHODS Between August 2013 and April 2015, we performed four consecutive laparoscopic total gastrectomies with double tract reconstruction for duodenal surveillance. Three of the patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer, while the remaining patient was diagnosed with gastric carcinoid. RESULTS No deaths occurred, and three of the patients showed no early complications. One patient with Crohn's disease developed anastomotic leakage, but it was successfully managed conservatively. On endoscopy three to seven months later, we were able to observe the duodenum via jejunal anastomosis in all of the patients. DISCUSSION Roux-en-Y reconstruction is one of the options after laparoscopic total gastrectomy. However, given that periodical endoscopic examinations of the duodenum are strongly recommended after surgery, double-tract reconstruction may be preferable in these patients. CONCLUSION Although more detailed data are required, double-tract reconstruction may be the best choice for patients requiring total gastrectomy with regular check-up of the duodenum.

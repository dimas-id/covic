Chikungunya virus infection is an infection transmitted by mosquitoes. It classically presents with fever and arthralgia. The rhabdomyolysis as a complication of this infection is rarely reported in the literature. We report a case of a previously healthy 34-year-old male patient with acute onset of fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and dark colored urine. Laboratory values revealed elevated creatinine, positive urine dipstick for blood, but urine microscopy showed no red blood cells. Serum creatine kinase (CK) was elevated (>2000 U/L). Serology was positive for Chikungunya IgM antibodies. Rhabdomyolysis due to acute Chikungunya viral infection was diagnosed. Patient condition improved with supportive treatment and was discharged home.

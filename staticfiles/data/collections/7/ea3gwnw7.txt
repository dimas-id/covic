After intracerebral inoculation of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV‐A59 strain, into 3‐ to 5‐day‐old Wistar rats, some survivors at 14 days postinoculation (p.i.) were found to lack the cerebral cortex and to have an accumulation of a considerable amount of cerebrospinal fluid. The virus titer in the brain increased exponentially after inoculation, reaching a maximum 4 to 6 days p.i. when immunofluorescence revealed virus‐specific antigen within neurons in the cerebral cortex. A small amount of infectious virus was also detectable 14 days p.i. when the cerebral anomaly was evident. This brain malformation causing hydrocephalus was due to cerebral damage by viral infection.

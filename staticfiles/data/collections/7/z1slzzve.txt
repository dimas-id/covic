BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (RD). METHODS: Data from 735 patients undergoing primary liver resection for HCC between 2002 and 2014 were analyzed. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the RD group, defined by a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the non-RD group. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients had RD. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion (24 vs. 11%; P = 0.007) and major complications (Clavien–Dindo III–V; 31 vs. 15%; P = 0.003) were significantly higher in RD patients. In RD patients with Child-Pugh A, 90-day mortality rate (1.9%) and median survival time (6.11 years) were comparable to that of non-RD patients. In contrast, RD patients with Child-Pugh B had a very high 90-day mortality rate (22.2%), and a significant shorter median survival time compared to non-RD patients (1.19 vs. 4.84 years; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Liver resection for Child-Pugh A patients with RD is safe and has comparable oncological outcomes compared to non-RD patients. However, selection of liver resection candidates from Child-Pugh B patients with RD should be stricter.

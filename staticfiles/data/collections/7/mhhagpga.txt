The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has a remarkably complex structure, composed of a single bilayer that forms the nuclear envelope, along with a network of sheets and dynamic tubules. Our understanding of the biological significance of the complex architecture of the ER has improved dramatically in the last few years. The identification of proteins and forces required for maintaining ER shape, as well as more advanced imaging techniques, has allowed the relationship between ER shape and function to come into focus. These studies have also revealed unexpected new functions of the ER and novel ER domains regulating alterations in ER dynamics. The importance of ER structure has become evident as recent research has identified diseases linked to mutations in ER-shaping proteins. In this review, we discuss what is known about the maintenance of ER architecture, the relationship between ER structure and function, and diseases associated with defects in ER structure.

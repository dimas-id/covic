Computerised educational neuroscience interventions that train within-domain inhibitory control (IC) can improve children’s counterintuitive reasoning. However, the HCI or adaptive design of such environments often receive less attention. Eye-tracking and click data were used to compare four versions of an IC-training game in terms of their HCI design and potential for supporting adaptive feedback. Our results provide insights for developing an adaptive system to scaffold pupils’ transition towards using IC in un-cued, self-regulated scenarios.

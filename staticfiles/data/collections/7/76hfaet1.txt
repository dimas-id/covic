Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may present with extra-pulmonary symptoms. We report a 16-year-old adolescent with SARS who presented with diarrhoea. Treatment directed against SARS was prompted by an epidemiological link and the clinical picture as the disease evolved. This atypical presentation posed a diagnostic challenge for physicians. Conclusion:Proper disposal of patient excreta is important to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome.

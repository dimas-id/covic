Robotic-assisted laparoscopy (RAL) presents several advantages over 3-dimensional conventional laparoscopy (3D-CL) that may facilitate laparoscopic suturing especially with novice surgeons. This study compares novice surgeons' suturing performance by 3D-CL and RAL using Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS), an objective, validated scoring tool. Twenty-two surgeons with no robotic experience completed a standardized suturing task in an experimental setup by both 3D-CL and RAL in a randomized, cross-over design. Two experienced surgeons blindly assessed their performance using OSATS. Median (interquartile range) OSATS scores for 3D-CL and RAL were, respectively, 22.8 (17.4 to 25.8) versus 25.0 (21.9 to 26.5), P=0.032. There was no association between laparoscopic experience and robotic-assisted suturing performance. Thus, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to compare novice surgeons' suturing performance by 3D-CL and RAL using an objective, validated scoring tool and to show better suturing performance when assisted by the robot regardless of experience level.

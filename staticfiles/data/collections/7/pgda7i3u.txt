A 72-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital because of dyspnea on exertion. Sputum cytologic evaluation revealed intranuclear inclusion bodies in the cells; we therefore considered viral pneumonia and performed a bronchoscopy. The bronchial washing fluid was positive for immunoperoxidase staining of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and HSV1 polymerase chain reaction. The patient was diagnosed as having pneumonia due to HSV1 and was successfully treated with acyclovir.

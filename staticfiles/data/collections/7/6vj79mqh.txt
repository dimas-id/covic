Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a type of inflammation affecting myocardial cells caused by viral infection and has been an important cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) worldwide. Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiClâ€™s antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment in vivo obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Our finding further expands the antiviral targets of LiCl and provides an alternative agent for viral myocarditis.

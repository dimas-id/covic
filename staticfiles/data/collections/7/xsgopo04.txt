In 2 multicenter cohort studies of 2912 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during 2007-2014, the 5 most common pathogens were RSV (76.5%), rhinovirus (23.8%), coronavirus (6.9%), adenovirus (6.4%) and human metapneumovirus (6.0%). Hospitalization months significantly differed for these common pathogens (P â‰¤ 0.01), except for coronavirus (P = 0.30). There was a significant heterogeneity in temporal patterns by region in RSV-A and -B (both P < 0.001).

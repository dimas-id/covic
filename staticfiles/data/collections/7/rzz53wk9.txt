Population-based data on COVID-19 are urgently needed. We report on three rounds of probability sample household surveys in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), carried out in nine large municipalities using the Wondfo lateral flow point-of-care test for immunoglobulin M and G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (https://en.wondfo.com.cn/product/wondfo-sars-cov-2-antibody-test-lateral-flow-method-2/). Before survey use, the assay underwent four validation studies with pooled estimates of sensitivity (84.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 81.4-87.8%) and specificity (99.0%; 95% CI = 97.8-99.7%). We calculated that the seroprevalence was 0.048% (2/4,151; 95% CI = 0.006-0.174) on 11-13 April (round 1), 0.135% (6/4,460; 95% CI = 0.049-0.293%) on 25-27 April (round 2) and 0.222% (10/4,500; 95% CI = 0.107-0.408) on 9-11 May (round 3), with a significant upward trend over the course of the surveys. Of 37 family members of positive individuals, 17 (35%) were also positive. The epidemic is at an early stage in the state, and there is high compliance with social distancing, unlike in other parts of Brazil. Periodic survey rounds will continue to monitor trends until at least the end of September, and our population-based data will inform decisions on preventive policies and health system preparedness at the state level.

BACKGROUND Presence of the vermiform appendix in an inguinal hernia sac is an uncommon finding (1%), exceptionally rare if it's inflamed (0.13%). Clinically simulating incarcerated inguinal hernia and proper preoperative diagnosis is exceptional. We present two unusual cases of Amyand's hernia, and review of the bibliography. CLINICAL CASES 1. Male patient 78 year old with an incarcerated right inguinal hernia which was performed preoperatively the diagnosis of Amyand's hernia by abdominal Computed Tomography. Clinical case 2. Female patient 82 year old with symptoms of an incarcerated right femoral hernia that finally showed an Amyand's hernia through a right inguinal hernia. CONCLUSIONS Amyand's hernia is a rare entity whose preoperative diagnosis is uncommon, that it should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases with clinical signs of incarcerated right inguinal hernia.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay capable of detecting and differentiating seven strains of equine arteritis virus (EAV) from around the world was developed. The primers for the PCR were chosen from the ORF 6 gene encoding the unglycosylated membrane protein (M). Viral RNA from cell culture fluids infected with each of the seven EAV strains and RNA from the live vaccine, Arvac, was detected by PCR using four sets of primers. The sensitivity of detection was increased from 100 to 1000 times by performing nested PCR enabling the detection of RNA at a level of 0.5â€“5 PFU. Differentiation among the virus strains and the live vaccine was achieved by cutting the PCR-amplified products from three sets of primers with six restriction endonucleases. Using this procedure it was possible to distinguish among the seven EAV strains used.

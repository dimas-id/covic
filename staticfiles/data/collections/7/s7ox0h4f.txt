Pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.New methods for the early detection of fungal and viral diseases might allow an immediate and specific therapy, thereby lowering the high mortality associated with such infections.The development of new drugs will hopefully lead to more effective treatment while decreasing the incidence of adverse effects. Interdisciplinary team work between internal medicine, radiology, surgery, microbiology, and virology is essential for the successful management of these patients.

Abstract The world and Kenya face a potential pandemic as the respiratory virus Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects world populations. Nations have been forced to intervene and issue directions under executive orders to ensure the pandemic is contained. Kenya has reported 110 confirmed COVID-19 cases (as at 2nd April, 2020), three persons have succumbed and 2 people have fully recovered. Most of the affected people had entered/returned to Kenya from different parts of the world. Most of the people who have contracted COVID 19 are between the 16â€“74 years of age. As a result, since February 2020, Kenya put in place several precautionary measures to mitigate the pandemic in its early stages. However, the economic status of the population of country won't be simple to control COVID 19, if government won't integrate the realistic feasible timely plans. This article highlights the preparedness, response, transmissibility of Covid-19 and proposes intuitions to manage COVID-19 in Kenya. Currently it is clear that since first confirmation to current, the transmission of the COVID-19 is exponentially increasing in Kenya.

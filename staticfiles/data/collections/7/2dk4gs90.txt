Inhalational route for drug delivery and desired effects has been known since centuries. This lung-targeted therapy has benefited asthmatics and those with chronic respiratory problems. The technique has evolved greatly from crude pots and pipes to modern sophisticated drug-dispensing devices. This mode is effective, rapid and safe. Its outcome, however, is majorly determined by drug formulation, device structure and patient's coordinating skill. In spite of great advances in this field, more efforts are required to meet the unmet needs. This noninvasive mode is being increasingly studied for transfer of drugs for systemic action with promising results. The present article is an attempt to capture the recent development and progress in this field and review relevant newer patents.

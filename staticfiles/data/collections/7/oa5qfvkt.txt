Monoclonal antibodies can be of mouse, part mouse part human (chimeric, humanized), or of human origin. Their preparation involves hybridoma, gene cloning, gene recombination, phage display, and gene transfection techniques. The preparation, mechanism of action, uses, and possible adverse effects of most of the available monoclonal antibodies used as prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic agents are reviewed.

Following the horrific events surrounding the death of George Floyd, we aim to shed some light on our perceptions of the pervasive issue of racism in America and how it impacts the work we do as reproductive endocrinologists. This issue is deeply rooted, and tackling it will involve a multifaceted approach. Ultimately, we are interested in starting this conversation and hope that our colleagues will not only acknowledge that there is a problem that requires immediate attention but will join us in providing sustainable solutions to it.

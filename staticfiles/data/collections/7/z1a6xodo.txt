Several methods of brain image registration have been proposed in order to overcome the requirement of clinicians. In this paper, we assess the performance of a hybrid method for brain image registration against the most used standard registration tools. Most traditional registration tools use different methods for mono- and multi-modal registration, whereas the hybrid registration method is providing both mono and multi-modal brain registration of PET, MRI and CT images. To determine the appropriate registration method, we used two challenging brain image datasets as well as two evaluation metrics. Results show that the hybrid method outperforms all other standard registration tools and has achieved promising accuracy for MRI/X brain image registration.

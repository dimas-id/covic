Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in infants. The virus has two subgroups A and B, which differ in prevalence and (nucleotide) sequence. The interaction of subgroup A viruses with the host cell is relatively well characterized, whereas for subgroup B viruses it is not. Therefore quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the interaction of subgroup B viruses with A549 cells, a respiratory cell line. Changes in the cellular proteome and potential canonical pathways were determined using SILAC coupled to LC‐MS/MS and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. To reduce sample complexity and investigate potential trafficking both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed. A total of 904 cellular and six viral proteins were identified and quantified, of which 112 cellular proteins showed a twofold or more change in HRSV‐infected cells. Data sets were validated using indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy on independent samples. Major changes were observed in constituents of mitochondria including components of the electron transport chain complexes and channels, as well as increases in the abundance of the products of interferon‐stimulated genes. This is the first quantitative proteomic analysis of cells infected with HRSV‐subgroup B.

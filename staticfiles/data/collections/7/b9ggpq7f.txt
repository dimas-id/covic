Junin virus (JUNV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of Argentine haemorrhagic fever (AHF), which is a serious public health problem with approximately 5 million people at risk. It is treated as a potential bioterrorism agent because of its rapid transmission by aerosols. JUNV is a negative-sense ssRNA virus that belongs to the genus Arenavirus within the family Arenaviridae, and its genomic RNA contains two segments encoding four proteins. Among these, the nucleoprotein (NP) has essential roles in viral RNA synthesis and immune suppression, but the molecular mechanisms of its actions are only partially understood. Here, we determined a 2.2 Ã… crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of JUNV NP. This structure showed high similarity to the Lassa fever virus (LASV) NP C-terminal domain. However, both the structure and function of JUNV NP showed differences compared with LASV NP. This study extends our structural insight into the negative-sense ssRNA virus NPs.

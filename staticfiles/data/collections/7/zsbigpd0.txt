We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the comments by Dr. Marongiu et al., they presented that as only laboratory findings of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) but no bleeding was mentioned, indicating that there was not an overt DIC in our patients, instead, the abnormal laboratory findings could be an expression of local DIC, i.e. a pulmonary vascular thrombosis. Thus they suggested the anticoagulant treatment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

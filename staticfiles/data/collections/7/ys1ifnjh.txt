Reconstruction of the irradiated perineum has posed a consistent reconstructive challenge historically. The evolution of reconstructive techniques must mirror advances in neoadjuvant treatment and surgery for low rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perineal healing in a cohort of patients, of whom a majority had laparoscopic tumor excision and partial myocutaneous gluteal flap reconstruction. There were 11 patients in this cohort; 8 primary reconstructions and 3 salvage cases. Complete healing was measured as the cessation of all dressings. There were no returns to theater for flap-related surgery. Mean postreconstruction inpatient stay was 16.5 days. All patients healed completely. Mean time to healing was 42 days. This method has been successful for primary and salvage reconstruction in patients having laparoscopic or open surgery; thus, averting the major morbidity associated with failed reconstruction as reported for most of other reconstructive modalities in these patients.

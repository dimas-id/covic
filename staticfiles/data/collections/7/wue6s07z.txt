Abstract Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which was first reported in southern China in 2017. It can cause severe diarrhea disease in pigs. In order to detect this new emerging virus rapidly and reliably, a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay was established in this study. Specific primers and probe were designed and synthesized based on the conserved region within the N gene of the viral genome. Results showed that the lowest limit of detection was 3.0 × 101 copies/μL. This approach was specific for SADS-CoV, and there were no cross-reaction observed against other 15 swine viruses. It was 10 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR and gave higher SADS-CoV positive detection rate (70.69%, 123/174) than the conventional PCR (51.15%, 89/174) from clinical samples. These data indicated that the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay established here was an effective method with high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility for faster and more accurate detection and quantification of SADS-CoV.

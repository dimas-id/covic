Discontinuities of the mandible can occur for a variety of reasons including primary pathology of bone, pathologic fracture secondary to periodontal disease, and segmental resection for the treatment of neoplasia. Surgical intervention is necessary in many cases to establish normal occlusion and normal mandibular function. Rigid stabilization and treatment of these defects can be challenging due to the limited availability of bone for fixation as well as limited soft tissue coverage. This case report describes successful treatment of a nonunion fracture using cortical allograft and locking titanium miniplates. Complete osseointegration and bone healing were achieved, allowing for complete return to normal occlusion and function.

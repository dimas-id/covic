Introduction True aneurysms of peripancreatic arterial arcades (PAAAs) coexisting with celiac axis lesion are often asymptomatic. However, they may rupture regardless of their size and cause life-threatening hypovolemia. No treatment guidelines exist to date. We present a series of 21 patients and our management algorithm. Material and Methods For ruptured aneurysms we preformed endovascular embolization. Further treatment was dependent on patient's condition and control studies. In case of unruptured aneurysms, we assessed collateral circulation between superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis in angio-CT. If there was a pathway free from aneurysms, endovascular approach was chosen. Otherwise, surgical or combined treatment was favored. Results Endovascular treatment was performed in 14 patients with no complications. Follow-up studies revealed incomplete occlusion of the aneurysms in two cases. Surgical or combined treatment was performed in 7 patients with three serious perioperative complications. They were managed conservatively in two cases and surgically in one. Follow-up studies showed aneurismal dilatation and stenosis of a renohepatic by-pass in one case. Conclusion We present our management algorithm of PAAAs. Our results support the leading role of endovascular treatment. We present its limitations favoring surgical or combined treatment. All patients should be carefully followed.

Background: Little is known about how COVID-19 infection affects pregnant women, as well as about the possibility of vertical transmission or that of premature labor. Thus, this studys objective was to identify existing evidence to directive public policies. Method: Systematic literature review assessing papers published in the most comprehensive databases in the field of health. Results: 12 papers were eligible. A total of 119 pregnant women aged between 22 and 42 years old and between the 12th and 41st weeks were analyzed; 90 children were born. Most pregnant women acquired the infection in the third trimester of pregnancy, 97.4% were diagnosed before hospitalization based on signs and symptoms. There was no maternal death and no vertical transmission was confirmed. Conclusions: pregnant women must be cautious and vigilant because their exposure to the virus, even if at the end of a pregnancy, has important repercussions, especially for the type of labor.

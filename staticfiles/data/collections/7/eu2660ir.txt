Unregulated cell proliferation can be disastrous for development and underlies the progression of cancers throughout the lifespan. A new paper in Development dissects the molecular regulation of a key cell proliferation promoter (and infamous oncogene) Myc, using Drosophila as a model system. We caught up with Olga Zaytseva, recent PhD graduate and one of the paper's first authors, and her supervisor Leonie Quinn, Associate Professor at the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra, to find out more.

Sepsis is a clinical syndrome with no effective protective or therapeutic treatments. Acacetin, a natural flavonoid compound, has anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects which can potentially work to reduce sepsis. We investigated the potential protective effect of acacetin on sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) ALI and dissect out the underlying mechanisms. Mice were divided into five groups: a sham group, a sepsis-induced ALI group, and three sepsis groups pre-treated with 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg body weight of acacetin. We found that acacetin significantly attenuated sepsis-induced ALI, in histological examinations and lung edema. Additionally, acacetin treatment decreased protein and inflammatory cytokine concentration and the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells in BALF compared with that in the non-treated sepsis mice. Pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was lower in the acacetin-pre-treated sepsis groups than in the sepsis group. The mechanism underlying the protective effect of acacetin on sepsis is related to the regulation of certain antioxidation genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), superoxide dismutases (SODs), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1).Taken together, our results indicate that acacetin pre-treatment inhibits sepsis-induced ALI through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activity, suggesting that acacetin may be a potential protective agent for sepsis-induced ALI.

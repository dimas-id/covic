In the context of education research, a concept inventory is an instrument (that consists of a number of multiple-choice questions) designed to test the understanding of concepts (and possibly the reasons for failure to understand) by learners. Subject to a few caveats they are known to be somewhat effective in non student centric learning environments. In this research the issue of adapting the subject/concept-specific instruments to make room for diverse response patterns (including vague ones) is explored in some detail by the present author. It is shown that higher granular operator spaces (or partial algebras) with additional temporal and key operators are well suited for handling them. An improved version of concept inventory called rough concept inventory that can handle vague subjective responses is also proposed in this research.

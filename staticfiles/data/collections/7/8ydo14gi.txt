The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of delivery of novel levofloxacin/ doxycycline (LEVO/DOX) combination to the brain by intranasal route to achieve a significant local concentration in the brain and a direct nose-to-brain pathway. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) were selected as a drug carrier and employed Box-Behnken design for optimizing LEVO/DOX-SLN to achieve minimum particle size and maximum apparent entrapment efficiency (EE). SLNs were prepared by hot emulsification and characterized. In vitro release of optimized formulations showed prolonged drug release from the optimized formulation. The results of pharmacokinetic study of the optimized SLN-HPMC gel in plasma and brain revealed significant increase in the brain peak concentration (420, 315 ng/g), the AUC 0-360 min (57130 and 48693.13 ng. min/g) in comparison to intranasal LEVO/DOX free solution with the values of (160, 120) ng/g, (36850, 27637.5 ngâ‹…min/g) for LEVO and DOX, respectively. The optimized LD-SLN-HPMC gel gave a drug-targeting efficiency (DTE %) of 149.815 and 161.969 for LEVO and DOX, respectively, in comparison to the intravenous route. Moreover, the optimized formulation had a direct transport percentage (DTP %) of 33.285 and 40.236 for LEVO and DOX, respectively, which indicates a significant contribution of direct nose-to-brain pathway in brain drug delivery.

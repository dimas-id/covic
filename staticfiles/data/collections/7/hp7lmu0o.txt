Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI‐3V) are the major viral agents which are consistently involved in causing lower respiratory tract disease in humans and animals. The virus infection begins in the upper respiratory tract, where immune responses are initiated, and then progresses to the lower respiratory tract where destruction of cells and tissues leads to bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, which is occasionally fatal. Nanoparticle vaccines, incorporating antigenic components from influenza, RSV, or PI‐3V have been shown to be capable of stimulating mucosal and systemic immune responses, which can prevent the spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract. The encapsulation of viral proteins within nanoparticles may also facilitate production of respiratory vaccines which are efficacious in infants, where presence of maternally derived antibodies can reduce vaccine efficacy.

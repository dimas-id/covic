OVERVIEW This article presents, in a user-friendly, tabluated form, the ABCD's current vaccination recommendations for four broad categories of cats: outdoor cats (ie, those with access outdoors that come into contact with other cats outdoors); indoor cats (ie, those with no contact with other cats from outdoors); rescue shelter cats; and cats in breeding catteries. Note that it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between these various categories and the definition in any individual case is left up to the veterinary surgeon conducting the vaccination interview.

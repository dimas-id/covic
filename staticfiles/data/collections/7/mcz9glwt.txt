The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of dual localisation with hookwire and lipiodol before needlescopy-assisted resection for pulmonary nodule. Computed tomography-guided dual marking was performed on 36 pulmonary nodules of 32 patients and needlescopy-assisted resection was performed monitored by C-arm fluoroscopy. The mean age of the patients was 58 ± 12 (range 12-77) yrs. The mean size of the nodules was 7.5 ± 3.7 (3-17) mm. Their mean distance from the pleural surface was 7.3 ± 7.5 (0-35) mm. There were nine pure ground-glass opacity lesions, five semi-solid lesions and 22 solid lesions. The time of the dual localisation procedure was 13.1 ± 4.8 (7-23) min. Complications of the marking were pneumothorax in nine patients, and intrapulmonary bleeding in three. One hookwire dislodged during the operation. All nodules were successfully resected under needlescopy without conversion to a conventional thoracoscopy (5 mm or 10 mm thoracoscopy) or a minithoracotomy. There was no complication related to needlescopy-assisted resection. Dual marking with hookwire and lipiodol is a safe and none time consuming procedure, and needlescopy-assisted lung resection for small nodules is technically feasible and useful for histological diagnosis and treatment.

Aims: We aimed to evaluate the extent to which HRQoL instruments developed based on the Western notion of health is applicable to Asian children and adolescents by assessing their conceptualization of QoL. A secondary objective is to evaluate the necessity of developing age- or gender-specific HRQoL instruments. Methods: We explored the meaning of general and health-related QoL through focus group discussions in Singapore, a multi-ethnic Asian society. Two investigators independently analysed the data. They extracted major and sub-themes related to both general and health-related QoL. The agreement between the analyses was compared and disagreement was resolved through discussion. Results: Thirty-two subjects (children: 50.0%, female: 50.0%) participated. There were few disagreements. Meanings of general and health-related QoL could be grouped under three broad themes: (1) physical, (2) psychological and (3) social health, consistent with the current definition of HRQoL. We found that Singaporean and Western children/adolescents share a remarkably similar notion of general and health-related QoL. Compared to adolescents, children were more likely to report positive emotions, be less mindful of othersâ€™ opinions and had less varied social activities. Conclusion: The results suggest that currently available instruments are potentially useful for Singaporean children/adolescents. We also found that age-specific HRQoL instruments are necessary.

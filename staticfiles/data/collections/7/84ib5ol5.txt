The Chinese government has formally set COVID-19 in the statutory notification and control system for infectious diseases according to the Law of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. China currently is still struggling to defend COVID-19 though great achievements and progresses are being got. Burn Department is one of sections in clinics with the highest infectious risk of COVID-19.

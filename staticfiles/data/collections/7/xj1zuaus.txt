Patients with COPD have an increased risk for severity of COVID-19. Flu-like symptoms with dyspnea may distinguish COVID-19 infection from dyspnea due to a COPD-related exacerbation. Management of COPD with COVID-19 warrants standard-of-care treatment with antimicrobial agents and corticosteroids, though limiting the dose and duration of steroids use may be warranted due to the risk of increased viral shedding. Modalities to treat acute respiratory failure can be used with some caveats. Patients with COPD and COVID-19 infection who treat their illness at home should self-isolate, use nebulizers in ways that avoid viral aerosolization, and frequently disinfect room surfaces.

COVID‚Äê19 pandemic is an emerging new human disease, where no vaccines, or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), or drugs are currently available for therapy. Active vaccination requires the induction of an immune response against a given agent to a susceptible individual for the purpose of preventing or treating an infectious disease and this usually takes time to develop. Thus, the use of existing autologous Ab administration, obtainable from recovered COVID 19 patients, after 2 weeks recovery, is the best and the most practical strategy for providing immediate passive immunity to susceptible recipients in need.

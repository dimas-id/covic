We read with great interest the publication of Messina et al (1) reporting the first case of SARS‐CoV2 infection in a young patient of 32‐year‐old suffering from psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treated by Guselkumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets specifically the p19 subunit of Interleukin (IL)‐23(2).The patient contracted the SARS‐CoV2 infection after a dinner with some friends but fortunately she developed very discrete symptoms including only mild fever and rhinorrhea. These findings support the potential role of IL‐23p19 inhibitors to counteract the « cytokine storm » triggered by the SARS‐CoV2 and which is potentially implicated in the severity of the symptoms (3).

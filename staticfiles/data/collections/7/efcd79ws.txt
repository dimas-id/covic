PURPOSE: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral tick-borne illness. Although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood, it is known to be a Nairovirus. We aimed to examine the viral effects of intense systemic inflammation and vascular damage on the pulmonary vascular beds and lung tissues. METHODS: A total of 45 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF were considered for this retrospective study. In this patient group, those whose lungs had been visualized via thoracic computer tomography (CT) were entered into the study. Diameters of the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries, atria, and ventricles were measured. Study group measurements were compared with the control group, which included patients with normal thoracic CT. RESULTS: Overall, 90 patients were enrolled in the study, with 45 patients in the study group and 45 in the control group. In the study group, the man-to-woman balance was 3/2. The average age in the study group was 54.07 ± 17.91 years. In comparing the average diameters of pulmonary arteries in the study and control groups, the study group’s average pulmonary artery diameter was significantly larger than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in diameters of the pulmonary trunks and main pulmonary arteries due to CCHF was first shown in this current study. Moreover, due to our findings, it should be noted that with the rise in pulmonary artery diameter in CCHF, pulmonary hypertension can appear acutely, and this condition can be significantly alter clinical course and follow-up of the viral illness.

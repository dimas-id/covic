Abstract In the clinical microbiology laboratory, the focus when choosing new tests is often on performance, turnaround time, and labor needs. This review examines available rapid, multiplexed tests from a different perspective: that of the patient. It considers whether published evidence supports the notion that use of rapid, on-demand tests (as opposed to batched testing) leads to better patient outcomes and whether broad, syndrome-based, multiplexed panels translate into better patient care than narrower monoplex or duplex assays. Finally, we examine how synergy between the clinical microbiology and antimicrobial stewardship programs is necessary to ensure that rapid tests, if implemented, impact the patients they are designed to support.

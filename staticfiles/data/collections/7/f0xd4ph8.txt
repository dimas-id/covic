The molecular mechanisms that link IFN-λ3 genotypes to differential induction of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) are not known. We measured the expression of IFN-λ and of the specific IFN-λ receptor chain (IFN-λR1) in 122 liver biopsies of patients with CHC and 53 control samples. The IFN-λ3 genotype was not associated with differential expression of IFN-λ, but rather IFN-λR1. In a series of 30 primary human hepatocyte (PHH) samples, IFN-λR1 expression was low but could be induced with IFN-α. IFN-α–induced IFN-λR1 expression was significantly stronger in PHHs carrying the minor IFN-λ3 allele. The analysis of liver biopsies of patients with CHC revealed a strong association of high IFN-λR1 expression with elevated ISG expression, with IFN-λ3 minor alleles, and with nonresponse to pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin. The findings provide a missing link between the IFN-λ3 genotype and the associated phenotype of treatment nonresponse.

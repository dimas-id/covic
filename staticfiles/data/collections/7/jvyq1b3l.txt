Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a causative agent of acute hepatitis and jaundice. The number of human infections is approximated to be over 20 million cases per year. The transmission is mainly via the fecal-oral route and contaminated water and food are considered to be a major source of infection. As a mouse model is not available, a recent development of a cell culture-adapted HEV strain (47832c) is considered as a very important tools for molecular analysis of HEV pathogenesis in cells. Previously, we demonstrated that HEV-encoded methyltransferase (MeT) encoded by the 47832c strain inhibits MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated activation of interferon β (IFN-β) promoter. Here, we report that MeT impairs the phosphorylation and activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the MeT encoded by the 47832c, but not that of HEV clinical or field isolates (SAR-55, Mex-14, KC-1, and ZJ-1), displays the inhibitory effect. A deeper understanding of MeTmediated suppression of IFN-β expression would provide basis of the cell culture adaptation of HEV.

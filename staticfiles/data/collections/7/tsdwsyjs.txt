Influenza is an infectious disease caused by influenza A and B viruses. Children are the group which is the most exposed to influenza and influenza-like infections. They are considered as carriers of influenza infections in the population. In the epidemic season 2015/2016 more than 8000 samples were tested, of which over 30 % specimens were collected from patients aged 0–14 years. In 42.3 % cases the influenza or influenza-like viruses were confirmed. The most common subtype was A/H1N1/pdm09. Analysis of positive specimens was categorized into three smaller groups 0–4, 5–9, 10–14. Differences in the frequency of virus detections in younger age groups appeared. This study has shown that children are a very important group in the spread of the influenza virus in the population. A higher percentage of vaccinated children would decrease the number of infected patients in the whole population.

The activity of the Reproductive Medicine poses a dilemma in this pandemic Covid-19. In fact, this is a theoretically non-emergency activity except for fertility preservation with oncological reasons. The majority of fertility societies in the world such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) recommended stopping the inclusion of new patients and continuing only the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycles that have already been initiated by promoting Freeze-all as much as possible. Initilaly, the "Société Tunisienne de Gynécologie Obstétrique" (STGO) issued national recommendations that echo the international recommendations. These recommendations were followed by the majority of IVF center in Tunisia. However, a number of new data are prompting us to update these recommendations.

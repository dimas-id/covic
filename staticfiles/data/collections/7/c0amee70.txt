Intestinal transplantation (IT) is the least common form of organ transplantation; however, it has shown exceptional growth and improvement in graft survival rates over the past two decades mainly due to better outcomes achieved during the first year of transplantation (76 % at 1 year), due to improvement in surgical techniques and the development of better immunosupressive therapies as we understand more about the relationship between the recipient and host immune system. There are still ongoing issues with chronic rejection and long-term survival. Intestinal transplantation is still an acceptable therapy for patients with intestinal failure (IF), but it is generally reserved for patients who develop severe and life-threatening complications despite standard therapies, or those who are not able to maintain a good quality of life. The purpose of this review is to describe the current status, indications, outcomes and advances in the field of intestinal transplantation.

Small RNAs, including short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are ubiquitous, versatile repressors of gene expression in plants, animals, and many fungi. They can trigger destruction of homologous mRNA or inhibition of cognate mRNA translation and play an important role in maintaining the stable state of chromosome structure and regulating the expression of protein‐coding genes. Furthermore, the recent research showed that there exists close relationship between small RNAs and human diseases. Several human diseases have surfaced in which miRNAs or their machinery might be implicated, such as some neurological diseases and cancers. The specificity and potency of small RNAs suggest that they might be promising as therapeutic agents. This article will review the role of small RNAs in some human diseases etiology and investigations of taking siRNAs as therapeutic tools for treating viral infection, cancer, and other diseases. We also discuss the potential of miRNAs in gene therapy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

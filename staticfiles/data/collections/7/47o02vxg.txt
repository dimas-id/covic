Abstract There has been an increase in influenza A variant detections in the US in recent years. In September 2012, an Ontario resident was diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) variant infection. The demonstrated cross reactivity with the A(H1N1)pdm09 H1 gene CDC realtime PCR suggests that laboratories that only use the pdm09 H1 gene PCR to confirm this subtype would incorrectly report this variant as a A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype unless they were doing further molecular investigations.

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for nephrectomy has been described since the early 1990s. More recently, MIS has been used for nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) when treating benign conditions. However, reports of NSS using MIS for malignant conditions are sparse. In this report, we describe our retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach for NSS for a localized Wilms tumor.

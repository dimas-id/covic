Abstract Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) is an emerging bat-borne human pathogen causing severe respiratory illness. To date, however, the evaluation of PRV virulence has largely depended on the limited numbers of clinical cases owing to the lack of animal models. To develop an in vivo model of PRV infection, an inbred C3H mouse strain was infected intranasally with pathogenic PRV strain Miyazaki-Bali/2007. C3H mice suffered severe lung infection with significant body weight reduction and died within 7 days after intranasal infection. Infectious viruses were isolated mainly from the lungs and trachea. Histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonia with monocytes infiltration. Following repeated intranasal infection, mice developed antibodies to particular structural and non-structural proteins of PRV. The results of these immunological assays will help to develop laboratory protocols for sero-epidemiological studies. Our small rodent model of lethal respiratory infection will further allow investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the high pathogenicity of PRV.

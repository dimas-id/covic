A library of mannose‐ and fucose‐based glycomimetics was synthesized and screened in a microarray format against a set of C‐type lectin receptors (CLRs) that included DC‐SIGN, DC‐SIGNR, langerin, and dectin‐2. Glycomimetic ligands able to interact with dectin‐2 were identified for the first time. Comparative analysis of binding profiles allowed their selectivity against other CLRs to be probed.

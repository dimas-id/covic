Encephalitis is often caused by viral infections and can affect various brain regions. The clinical symptoms are highly variable. Oligosymptomatic cerebral infections may remain undetected but there are also cases with very severe symptoms (e.g. paralysis, convulsions). This article presents the case of an 8-year-old girl who suffered from headaches and vomiting for several days following a harmless fall with impact on the back of the head. The health condition decreased rapidly and 7 days after the fall the girl was presented to a childrenâ€™s hospital. After a further foudroyant course of the disease the girl was hospitalized 2 days later. Resuscitation became necessary due to convulsions and pulmonary obstruction. Cranial computed tomography (cCT) revealed temporal hypodense areas and local edema. Cardiac echocardiography revealed a decreased left ventricular pump function so that encephalitis and myocarditis were suspected. Despite antiviral and antibiotic therapy the girl died 4 days after admission due to intravital brain death and multiorgan failure. This cause of death was confirmed by forensic autopsy. The fall had not led to any intracranial injury and predisposing diseases were not found. Histological examination revealed necrotizing brainstem encephalitis.

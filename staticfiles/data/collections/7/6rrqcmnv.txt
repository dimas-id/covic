DFT/B3LYP calculations have been performed on series of molecules of natural products containing cinnamon and citrus, namely, cinnamic aldehyd, ascorbic acid and hesperidin. This theoretical investigation predicts the biological activities of mixtures between cinnamon and ascorbic acid and between cinnamon and hesperidin based on already proven values for these molecules. The strength of the intermolecular interactions is evaluated in term of energy decomposition of the total interaction energy ΔE(int) between molecules, which are mainly governed by electrostatic interactions. The HOMO–LUMO gaps explain that the possible charge transfer interactions that take place within the molecules are responsible for the molecular reactivity of the studied molecules. The chemical hardness, the chemical potential and the electrophilicity indexes are good indicators for biological activities showing their improvement to that of cinnamon itself. The mixture of hesperidin and cinnamon could be an excellent blood thinner with the regard to its polarity’s enhancement.

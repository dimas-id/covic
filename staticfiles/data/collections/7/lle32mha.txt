Abstract Many inflammatory and infectious diseases are characterized by the activation of signaling pathways steaming from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These pathways, primarily associated with loss of ER homeostasis, are emerging as key regulators of inflammation and infection. Recent advances shed light on the mechanisms linking ER-stress and immune responses.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to circulate in the population. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study. Adult COVID-19 cases from four hospitals in Zhejiang were enrolled and clustered into 3 groups based on epidemiological history. First-generation patients had a travel history to Hubei within 14 days before disease onset; second generation patients had a contact history with first-generation patients; third-generation patients had a contact history with second-generation patients. Demographic, clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes, and duration of viral shedding were analyzed. RESULTS: 171 patients were enrolled, with 83, 44, and 44 patients in the first, second, and third generation, respectively. Compared to first and second generation, third generation patients were older (61.3 vs. 48.3 and 44.0 y, P<0.001), had more coexisting conditions (56.8% vs. 36.1% and 27.3%, P=0.013). At 7±1 days from illness onset, third generation patients had lower lymphocyte (0.6 vs. 0.8 and 0.8×10(9)/L, P=0.007), higher C-reactive protein (29.7 vs. 17.1 and 13.8mg/L, P=0.018) and D-dimer (1066 vs. 412.5 and 549μg/L, P=0.002) and more lesions involving the pulmonary lobes (lobes≥5, 81.8% vs. 53.0% and 34.1%, P<0.001). The proportions of third-generation patients developing severe illness (72.7% vs. 32.5% and 27.3%, P<0.001), critical illness (38.6% vs. 10.8% and 6.8%, P<0.001) and receiving endotracheal intubation (20.5% vs. 3.6% and 2.3%, P=0.002) were higher than the other two groups. CONCLUSION: The third generation patients were older, had more underlying comorbidities and had a higher proportion of severe or critical illness compared to first and second-generation.

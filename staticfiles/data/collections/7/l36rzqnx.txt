Computational virtual screening is useful and powerful strategy for rapid discovery of small biologically active molecules in the early stage of drug discovery. The discovery of a broad range of important biological processes involved by RNA has increased the importance of RNA as a new drug target. To apply structure-based virtual screening methods to the discovery of RNA-binding ligands, many RNA 3D structure prediction programs and optimized docking algorithms have been developed. In this chapter, a number of successful cases of virtual screening targeting RNA will be introduced.

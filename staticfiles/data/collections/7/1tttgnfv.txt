INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS To elevate and suspend the apical end of the vagina, the uterosacral ligaments (USL) were replaced by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) structures. These PVDF structures were placed in the peritoneal folds of the USL at the pelvic wall to mimic the lateral and backward tension and to avoid rectal obstruction. A special tunneling device was used, which allowed the semi-circular placement of the structure without destroying the peritoneum. METHODS A 59-year-old woman with mixed urinary incontinence and apical prolapse (pelvic organ prolapse quantification system, POP-Q, stage 2) of the uterus underwent laparoscopic bilateral USL replacement. USLs were replaced by PVDF structures by performing the cervicosacropexy (CESA) technique using a semi-circular tunneling device. RESULTS Apical support was restored (POP-Q stage 0), and the patient was continent thereafter. The tunneling device was pulled through the peritoneal folds of the USLs toward the cervix. The new USL structures were brought to their physiological position. The new technique did not lead to any complications and did not cause any side effects during 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Restoration of apical prolapse and urinary continence was achieved by bilateral USL replacement using a semi-circular tunneling device that was inserted through the lateral abdominal trocar incision.

An integrated microfluidic system for combined manipulation, pre-concentration, and lysis of samples containing Bordetella pertussis by dielectrophoresis and electroporation has been developed and implemented. The microfluidic device was able to pre-concentrate the amount of B. pertussis cells present in 200 microl of a B. pertussis suspension stock into a 20 microl volume. The device exhibited optimal sample pre-concentration of 6.7x at a stock value of 10(3) cfu/ml and at a flow rate of 250 microl/h. Electro-disruption experiments showed that on-chip-based electroporation is an effective solution for lysis of B. pertussis cells that is easily integrated with dielectrophoresis assisted pre-concentration procedures. Pulsed voltage applied, number of pulses, and presence of potassium chloride in a B. pertussis suspension showed a reduction in B. pertussis cell viability by electroporation; and transmission electron microscopy confirmed B. pertussis cell disruption by electroporation. Genetic amplification and detection of the pre-concentrated sample employing an integrated chip-based system demonstrated a complete chip approach for pathogen detection.

As pandemic wide spread results in locking down vital facilities, digital contact tracing is deemed as a key for re-opening. However, current efforts in digital contact tracing, running as mobile apps on users' smartphones, fall short in being effective. This paper lays out the vision and guidelines for the next era of digital contact tracing, where the contact tracing functionality is moved from being personal responsibility to be the responsibility of facilities that users visit daily. A privacy-preserving architecture is proposed, which can be mandated as a prerequisite for any facility to re-open during or after the pandemic.

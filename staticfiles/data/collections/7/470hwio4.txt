1. This study has demonstrated that great efforts have been made by the Hospital Authority and the studied hospital cluster to contain and prevent infection, and that high levels of vigilance have been enforced in anticipation of future outbreaks of SARS and other droplet infections. 2. Most health care workers and support workers have good hospital infection control and isolation precaution knowledge levels. 3. Compliance with infection control guidelines is satisfactory and has increased compared with previous studies. 4. Most participants had positive perceptions of the guidelines and found the training programmes useful. 5. This study has identified several structures and infection control practice areas that need strengthening, including improving the clarity of some guidelines and minimising barriers to their implementation.

OBJECTIVE Bronchial fistulae following lung surgery are associated with high mortality. We examined the histological effects of mucosal ablation as a technique for closing bronchial stumps to prevent bronchial fistulae in an animal model. METHODS Left lower lobectomy was performed in beagles under general anesthesia. The bronchial stumps were closed using one of the following four methods: (A) manual suturing using 3-0 absorbable sutures, (B) ablation of bronchial mucosa with electric cautery and manual sutures, (C) stapling and reinforcement with manual sutures, or (D) ablation and stapling followed by reinforcement with manual sutures. Bronchial stumps were histologically evaluated on postoperative day 14. RESULTS No bronchial fistulae were noted in the animals during the observation period. Histologically, there were no adhesions between the bronchial mucosae at the suture and staple lesions in groups A and C. The bronchial mucosae were adherent at the ablation sites in groups B and D. Inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and neovascular vessels were abundant around the ablated lesions. CONCLUSIONS Bronchial mucosal ablation may play a key role in mucosal adhesion and tight union of the bronchial stump.

A novel infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) identified in late 2019 has now been labelled as a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). The COVID-19 outbreak has shown some positive impacts on the natural environment. In present work, India is taken as a case study to evaluate the effect of lockdown on air quality of three Indian cities. The variation in concentration of key air pollutants including [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] during two phases, pre-lockdown and post-lockdown phases, was analysed. The concentration of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] reduced by 55%, 49%, 60% and 19%, and 44%, 37%, 78% and 39% for Delhi and Mumbai, respectively, during post-lockdown phase. Overall, the findings in present study may provide confidence to the stakeholders involved in air quality policy development that a significant improvement in air quality can be achieved in future if better pollution control plans are strictly executed.

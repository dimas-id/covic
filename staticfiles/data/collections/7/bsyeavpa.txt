Five tumours removed from the larynx and the pharynx have been examined. The results of cytophotometric survey of the DNA content were compared with that of the cellkinetic and histological investigation as well as the clinical progress. A distinct correlation between the position of DNA-Stem-line in the aneuploid region and the development of the tumours was observed. The cellkinetic and cytophotometric results showed that the irradiated cells remained in the G (2)-Phase for a long period.

BACKGROUND The yield of repeat catheter angiography in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who have negative initial catheter and computed tomography (CT) angiograms is not well understood. OBJECTIVE To determine the yield of repeat catheter angiography in a prospective cohort of patients with SAH and negative initial catheter and CT angiograms. METHODS From January 1, 2005, until September 1, 2010, we instituted a prospective protocol in which patients with SAH documented by noncontrast CT (NCCT) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) xanthochromia and negative initial catheter and CT angiograms were evaluated with repeat catheter angiography 7 days and 3 months after presentation to assess for causative vascular abnormalities. RESULTS Seventy-two patients were included, with a mean age of 53.1 years (median, 53.5 years; range, 19-88 years). Forty-six patients were female (63.9%) and 26 male (36.1%). Thirty-nine patients had nonperimesencephalic SAH (54.2%), 29 patients had perimesencephalic SAH (40.3%), and 4 patients had CSF xanthochromia (5.5%). The first repeat catheter angiogram performed 7 days after presentation demonstrated a causative vascular abnormality in 3 patients (yield of 4.2%), 2 of which had nonperimesencephalic SAH (yield of 5.1%), and 1 had perimesencephalic SAH (yield of 3.4%). The second repeat catheter angiogram performed in 43 patients (59.7%) did not demonstrate any causative vascular abnormalities. No causative abnormalities were found in patients with CSF xanthochromia. CONCLUSION Repeat catheter angiography performed 7 days after presentation is valuable in the evaluation of patients with SAH who have negative initial catheter and CT angiograms, demonstrating a causative vascular abnormality in 4.2% of patients.

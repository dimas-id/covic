Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-associated disease (PCVAD) continues to be an important differential diagnosis on pig farms in the United States and worldwide. Case trend analyses indicate that the incidence of PCVAD is on the rise in the United States. Accurate diagnosis is important in order to implement appropriate intervention strategies. PCVAD can manifest as a systemic disease, as part of the respiratory disease complex, as an enteric disease, as porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, or as reproductive problems. PCVAD may be only a sporadic individual animal diagnosis; however, PCVAD may also manifest as a severe herd problem accelerated and enhanced by concurrent virus or bacterial infections. This article is intended to discuss the most common disease manifestations, pathogenesis, diagnostic approaches, and intervention strategies associated with PCVAD in North America.

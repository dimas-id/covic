BACKGROUND Recently, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been used for bariatric procedures, and this surgery is considered a type of minimally invasive surgery. When SILS is performed via the transumbilical route, the resultant abdominal wound is hidden and the cosmetic outcome is better. However, because of the small angle of manipulation and difficulty in liver traction, this technique is not used to perform complex bariatric surgery. In this prospective study, we used our novel technique, which involves the use of a liver-suspension tape and umbilicoplasty of an omega-shaped incision (omega umbilicoplasty), to perform laparoscopic bariatric surgery via the single-incision transumbilical (SITU) approach. We then assessed the safety and effectiveness of our surgical technique. METHODS We started performing and developing this technique from December 2008. Until July 2009, 40 consecutive patients underwent 40 bariatric procedures: two adjustable gastric band placements, six sleeve gastrectomies, and 32 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass operations, including five cases where concomitant cholecystectomy was performed. RESULTS The mean operation time was 93.4 min and the mean duration of postoperative hospitalization was 1.15 days. No perioperative or postoperative complications or deaths occurred. Most patients were very satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSION Our technique can be safely and effectively used for SITU laparoscopic bariatric surgery. This technique will soon be used for advanced abdominal surgeries besides bariatric ones.

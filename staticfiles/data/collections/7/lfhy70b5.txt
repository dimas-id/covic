Structure-based design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of peptidomimetic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus chymotrypsin-like protease inhibitors is described. These inhibitors were designed and synthesized based upon our X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 1 bound to SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Incorporation of Boc-Ser as the P4-ligand resulted in enhanced SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitory activity. Structural analysis of inhibitor-bound X-ray structure revealed high binding affinity towards the enzyme.

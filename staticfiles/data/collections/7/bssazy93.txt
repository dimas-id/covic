A lab-in-a-tube microarray system is developed for sample inspection and signal detection by fabricating a flat transparent window cap of the Eppendorf tube. The oligonucleotide microarray is immobilized on the inner surface of the cap. A small vessel is placed in an Eppendorf tube for storing hybridization solutions. With the microarray system, the full biochemical processes, including gene fragment amplification, fluorescence labeling, hybridization, and fluorescence detection, have been performed in the sealed tube without opening the cap. The images are obtained from a fluorescence microscope and captured by a CCD, and the data are transported to a computer through the universal serial bus (USB). After noise reduction, signal intensity is determined from hybridization image and the presence of gene fragments is identified. The final data output includes sample information, process steps, and hybridization results. A lab-in-a-tube microarray system for detecting ten respiratory viruses at a single detection is designed. High detection throughput and accuracy have been demonstrated with the system.

BACKGROUND The efficacy of second-generation PillCam -COLON2 capsule endoscopy (CCE2) in detecting colorectal superficial lesions remains unclear. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of CCE2 in the detection of colorectal superficial lesions. METHODS We performed CCE2 in 60 consecutive patients between April 2011 and -December 2017. Lesions ≥6 mm in size were detected in 34 patients (25 males, average age: 60.5 years). We performed endoscopic resection and histopathological analysis of all resected lesions within 3 months after CCE2. We considered the optical colonoscopy (OC) findings as the gold standard and evaluated CCE2 sensitivity. RESULTS Sixty-seven lesions (≥6 mm) were detected via OC, with 27 colorectal superficial lesions and 40 protruded lesions. CCE2 sensitivity for ≥6-mm-sized, superficial, and protruded lesions was 84, 78, and 88%, respectively. No significant intergroup differences were observed. CCE2 false-negative colorectal superficial lesions accounted for 31% of right-sided colon lesions and 50% of sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/Ps). The CCE2 false-negative protruded lesions accounted for 17% of right-sided colon lesions. CONCLUSION CCE2 sensitivities for colorectal superficial and protruded lesions were not significantly different. However, flat-type SSA/Ps in the right colon, especially when the transit time is fast, have a risk of demonstrating CCE2 false-negative results.

BACKGROUND: Epidemics are a major cause of health problems in developing countries, preventing the accumulation of human capital and economic growth. On the appearance of the pandemic of the new coronavirus COVID‐19 worldwide, this survey was carried out in the 4th week of the occurrence of the cases in Greece. OBJECTIVES: The investigation was aimed at the social and economic impact caused by this COVID‐19 pandemic and the state's decision to suspend the operation of businesses and stores in Greece. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifth‐eight aesthetic centers from various areas of Greece were participated in this study, and the questionnaires were sent electronically to the business owners. Statistical analyzes were conducted using Google Forms and the questionnaires analyzed through PSPP software. RESULTS: Based on their answers and the statistical analyzes, it was calculated the reduction of the monthly income for the first month of suspension of the operation of their companies. Additionally, social related matters were examined as, how they experience this period, psychologically, financially, what problems they believe that they will face and what changes in their work that could result from the pandemic. DISCUSSION: There is no similar study and experience for aesthetic centers from a viral pandemic in literature. The suspension of operations provoked serious financial problems and significant psychological burden about what “tomorrow will bring” with returning to “normalcy”.

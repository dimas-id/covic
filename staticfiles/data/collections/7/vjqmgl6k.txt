The ongoing new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which arose at the end of 2019, poses a severe challenge to world public health systems. Frontline medical staffs bear a great burden to provide health care services. The Taiwan government has taken rapid and decisive actions to reduce the risk of community transmission and campus cluster infection. Nursing education includes both classroom teaching and clinical practicum components. In preparing for their practicum, students must learn not only fundamental nursing care knowledge but also basic knowledge on emerging infectious diseases. All schools nationwide have complied with the Ministry of Education order to postpone the opening of the fall semester in response to the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Campus epidemic prevention measures were implemented through student counseling networks, and flexible teaching strategies, including online teaching and distance teaching, were implemented to protect the learning rights of students. This paper explores the strategies implemented in response to emerging infectious diseases in nursing education based on the core values of professional nursing. Examining the precautions taken at campuses and teaching strategies adopted in response to the COVID 19 pandemic may provide valuable insights that may be applied to the future development of nursing education.

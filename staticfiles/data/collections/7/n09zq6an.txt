Acute viral encephalitis requires rapid pathogen elimination without significant bystander tissue damage. In this article, we show that IL-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, is produced transiently at the peak of infection by CD8 T cells in the brains of coronavirus-infected mice. IL-10(+)CD8 and IL-10(-)CD8 T cells interconvert during acute disease, possibly based on recent Ag exposure. Strikingly, IL-10(+)CD8 T cells were more highly activated and cytolytic than IL-10(-)CD8 T cells, expressing greater levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as cytotoxic proteins. Even though these cells are highly proinflammatory, IL-10 expressed by these cells was functional. Furthermore, IL-10 produced by CD8 T cells diminished disease severity in mice with coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, suggesting a self-regulatory mechanism that minimizes immunopathological changes.

We present a method of generalization of the Lov√°sz extension formula combining two known approaches - the first of them based on the replacement of the product operator by some suitable binary function F and the second one based on the replacement of the minimum operator by a suitable aggregation function A. We propose generalization by simultaneous replacement of both product and minimum operators and investigate pairs (F, A) yielding an aggregation function for all capacities.

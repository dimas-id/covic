Widespread opinions and discussion exist regarding the efficiency of social distancing after crucial spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the actual Covid-19 pandemic. While Germany has released a federal law that prohibits any type of direct contact for more than 2 people other countries including the US released curfews. People are now wondering whether these measures are helpful to stop or hamper the Covid-19 pandemic and to limit the spread of the new corona virus. A quantitative statement on this question depends on many parameters that are difficult to grasp mathematically and cannot therefore be made conclusively (they include consistent adherence to the measures decided, the estimated number of unreported cases, the possible limitation by test capacities, possible mutations of the virus, etc ...). However, it turns out that a reduction in the actual daily new infection rate (actual daily growth rate of reported cases, in short: infection rate) from the current value of 30-35% in the US to 10% would be extremely effective in stopping the spread of the virus. The severe restrictions in Germany which closed any public events, schools and universities a week ago might already have contributed to a reduction of the growth rate of reported cases below 30%.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that primarily infects porcine intestinal epithelial cells and causes severe diarrhea and high fatality in piglets. A77 1726 is the active metabolite of leflunomide, a clinically approved anti-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug. A77 1726 inhibits the activity of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), p70 S6 kinase (S6K1), and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DHase). Whether A77 1726 can control coronavirus infections has not been investigated. Here we report that A77 1726 effectively restricted PEDV replication by inhibiting Janus kinases (JAKs) and Src kinase activities but not by inhibiting DHO-DHase and S6K1 activities. Overexpression of Src, JAK2 or its substrate STAT3 enhanced PEDV replication and attenuated the antiviral activity of A77 1726. Our study demonstrates for the first time the ability of A77 1726 to control coronavirus replication by inhibiting PTK activities. Leflunomide has potential therapeutic value for the control of PEDV and other coronavirus infections.

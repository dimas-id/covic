OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystoduodenostomy in canine cadavers using barbed self-locking sutures. STUDY DESIGN In vivo experimental study. ANIMALS Fresh male Beagle cadavers (n=5). METHODS Surgery was performed by a single veterinary surgeon. Dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency and 15° reverse Trendelenburg position. The surgical procedure was performed with four 5 mm entry ports and a 5 mm 30° telescope. The cholecystoduodenostomy technique included dissection, incision of the gallbladder, and lavage, followed by gallbladder transposition over the duodenum, incision of the duodenum, and anastomosis. The latter was performed with a 4-0 barbed self-locking suture (V-Loc® 180). Subsequently, a leak test was performed by submerging the anastomosis in saline and insufflating air into the duodenum through a catheter. Total operative time and completion times for each procedural step were recorded. RESULTS The median total operative time was 151 minutes (range, 129-159). One conversion to open surgery occurred because of vascular hemorrhage. The 3 longest intraoperative steps were posterior wall anastomosis, gallbladder dissection, and anterior wall anastomosis. Intraoperative anastomotic leakage sites were identified in 3 of 5 dogs. Leaks were managed by placement of a single reinforcing conventional intracorporeal suture, which was adequate to obtain a watertight anastomosis. CONCLUSION This technique cannot be recommended in clinical practice until further studies are performed and the technique is further refined.

Resveratrol has been widely studied for its therapeutic potential due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. In particular, resveratrol has shown promising antiviral activity against numerous viruses responsible for severe respiratory infections. Amongst these, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and the emerging SARS-cov-2 are known to cause pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ failure, especially, in vulnerable individuals like immunocompromised patients or the elderly, leading to a considerable economic burden worldwide. In this context, resveratrol may have potential value for its anti-inflammatory activity, since most of the severe virus-associated complications are related to the overactivation of the host-immune response, leading to lung damage. Herein, we present an overview of the antiviral activity and potential mechanisms of resveratrol against the respiratory tract viruses considered as a public threat for their rapid transmission and high morbidity and mortality in the general population.

Abstract Zimbabwe is among the countries that have been identified to be at risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the 15th of March 2020, there has been no confirmed case of the virus. Official reports of suspect cases were used to appraise the general screening, case management, and preparedness of the country towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the surveillance and capacity to screen at ports of entry, the country seems to be faring well. The country might not be screening optimally, considering the number of COVID-19 tests conducted to date and suspected cases who missed testing. Three of the suspected cases faced mental, social, and psychological consequences due to them being suspects of COVID-19. There is a need to enhance the screening process and infrastructure at all ports of entry. More COVID-19 diagnostic tests should be procured to increase the testing capacity. Training and awareness of mental, social, and psychological consequences of COVID-19 should be offered to health care workers and the public. More financial resources should be sourced to enable the country to control the pandemic.

The radioulnar ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), especially the deep fibers inserted at the ulnar fovea, is the key component for the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability. Traumatic injuries to the TFCC foveal insertion would cause DRUJ instability. Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques of the TFCC repair are suturing the ulnar-sided disruption peripherally to the dorsal or ulnar capsule instead of suturing the TFCC to the fovea and thus fail to restore the DRUJ stability if the TFCC is detached from the fovea. Recently, some arthroscopic foveal repair techniques have been reported using a suture anchor or transosseous sutures to address the foveal tear. This technical note describes an arthroscopic transosseous technique to reattach the foveal-disrupted TFCC. A 1.6-mm small osseous tunnel is created on the radial border of the fovea and 4 sutures are passed into the tunnel by using a 16-gauge needle. The TFCC could be sutured arthroscopically with these 4 sutures and be compressed against the fovea. Our technique provides not only a good suture construct for TFCC foveal reattachment but also an anatomic contact surface between the torn TFCC and its foveal footprint for healing. We recommend this technique as an alternative for repairing TFCC foveal tear.

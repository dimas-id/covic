Understanding the fundamental reproductive biology of a species is the first step towards identifying parameters that are critical for reproduction and for the development of assisted reproductive techniques. Ejaculates were collected from aquarium (n = 24) and in situ (n = 34) sand tiger sharks Carcharias taurus. Volume, pH, osmolarity, sperm concentration, motility, status, morphology and plasma membrane integrity were assessed for each ejaculate. Semen with the highest proportion of motile sperm was collected between April-June for both in situ and aquarium sand tiger sharks indicating a seasonal reproductive cycle. Overall, 17 of 30 semen samples collected from aquarium sharks from April through June contained motile sperm compared to 29 of 29 of in situ sharks, demonstrating semen quality differences between aquarium and in situ sharks. Sperm motility, status, morphology and plasma membrane integrity were significantly higher (P < 0.05) for in situ compared to aquarium sand tiger sharks. Testosterone was measured by an enzyme immunoassay validated for the species. Testosterone concentration was seasonal for both aquarium and in situ sharks with highest concentrations measured in spring and lowest in summer. In situ sharks had higher (P < 0.05) testosterone concentration in spring than aquarium sharks. This study demonstrated annual reproduction with spring seasonality for male sand tiger sharks through marked seasonal differences in testosterone and semen production. Lower testosterone and poorer semen quality was observed in aquarium sharks likely contributing to the species' limited reproductive success in aquariums.

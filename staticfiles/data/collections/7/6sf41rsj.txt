Abstract Background Rapid tests have had a significant impact on influenza diagnosis, but more accurate tests are needed for hospitalized patients who test negative by rapid methods. Objective We sought to determine the increased yield obtained from influenza RT-PCR in hospitalized patients compared to two rapid methods. Study design Binax NOW, cytospin-enhanced direct immunofluoroescence (DFA), and influenza A and B multiplex TaqMan RT-PCR were performed on 237 clinical samples. Results Binax NOW detected 70 (53.0%), cytospin-DFA detected 127 (96.2%), and TaqMan RT-PCR detected 132 (100%) influenza-positive samples. The difference in sensitivity was significant between RT-PCR and Binax NOW (p <0.0001), but not between RT-PCR and cytospin-DFA (p =0.0736). Two samples testing positive for influenza B by all three methods, tested falsely positive for influenza A by Binax. Eight true positive samples did not become reactive by Binax until 30min, and thus were counted as negative. Conclusions The accuracy of real-time RT-PCR should greatly improve the diagnosis of influenza in hospitals using simple rapid flu tests, but may have a more modest impact in hospitals with expertise in cytospin-DFA. Further studies are needed to determine the effect of influenza RT-PCR on patient management and costs in hospitalized patients.

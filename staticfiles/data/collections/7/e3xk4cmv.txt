From the beginning of the year 2020, the world was affected by a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, leading to a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) at a global level, and thus generating exposure of health professionals to this extremely contagious virus. Within this context, the present work seeks to present an alternative for the production of face shields "face shields," in which it recommends its production "in house" through 3D printing, in principle initiated by Prusa Research, where we download your project of support of facial protectors, proceeding with printing through the 3D printer Gtmax3D Core H5. The authors produced a face shield in ABS, in a total time of 3 hours and 44 minutes. Thus, the model presented proved to be feasible, at a low cost, adding to the list of possibilities to produce inputs necessary to maintain the fight against this epidemic.

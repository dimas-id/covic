The novel SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus in Wuhan, China, has triggered a worldwide respiratory disease outbreak (COVID-19). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan dysfunction and thrombotic events are among the leading causes of death in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The elevated inflammatory cytokines suggest that a "cytokine storm", also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), may play a major role in the pathology of COVID-19. In addition to anti-viral therapy and supportive treatment in critically ill patients, unique medications for this condition are also under investigation. Here we reviewed therapeutic options, including the antibody therapy that might be an immediate strategy for SARS-CoV-2 therapy.

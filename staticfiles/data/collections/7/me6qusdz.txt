Abstract Background: The American Academy of Pediatrics 2015 policy statement on telehealth proposed that telehealth could increase access to high-quality pediatric care and that pediatricians should work to reduce barriers to telehealth for their patients. However, little is known about pediatriciansâ€™ experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth. Methods: Data from a nationally representative survey of AAP post-residency US member pediatricians in 2016, restricted to respondents providing direct patient care (n=744; response rate=48.7%). Survey collected information on experience with telehealth in the previous 12 months, perceived barriers to telehealth incorporation, and conditions under which non-users would consider using telehealth. In addition to descriptive statistics, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine characteristics associated with any telehealth experience in the past 12 months. Results: Fifteen percent of pediatricians reported any telehealth use in the 12 months prior to the survey. The most commonly reported barriers to telehealth adoption were insufficient payment and billing issues. Multivariable regression models indicated that pediatricians in rural areas, the West, and subspecialists were most likely to report telehealth use, and identifying barriers was negatively associated with telehealth use. Among non-users, over half indicated they would consider adopting telehealth if they were paid for the visits. Conclusion: Telehealth is considered an important health care delivery mechanism, but only 15% of pediatricians in 2016 reported having used telehealth. Reducing barriers will be instrumental in promoting future telehealth adoption. Many barriers have been reduced during the response to COVID-19, and the impact of these policy changes will need further study.

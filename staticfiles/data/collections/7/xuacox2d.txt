Introduction One of the popular treatment strategies for complex cerebral aneurysms with wide necks or low dome-to-neck ratios is stent-assisted coiling. The most widely used intracranial stents for stent-assisted coiling are Neuroform (NF) and Enterprise (EP) stents. The purposes of this study are to review the recent literature of the past 5 years to compare outcomes between the EP and NF stent-assist coiling systems so as to comment on the safety, efficacy, complications, and recurrence rate of stent-assisted coiling in general. Methods PubMed was used to search for all published literature of NF or EP stent-assisted coiling of unruptured cerebral aneurysms from January 2014 to August 2019 with the search terms of "Enterprise stent-assisted coiling," "Neuroform stent," and "Neuroform vs. Enterprise stent." Results Twenty two publications met the inclusion criteria which encompass 1764 patients and 1873 aneurysms. Out of these 1873 aneurysms, 1007 aneurysms were treated with EP stent and 866 aneurysms were treated with NF stent. The overall outcome was low rates of thromboembolic complications (4.37%) and intracranial hemorrhage (1.13%), low permanent morbidity (1.70%) and mortality (0.40%), and lower rate of recanalization (11%). Data analysis shows an overall higher rate of complication and recurrence of aneurysm and lower overall rate of aneurysmal occlusion in the patients where EP stent was used in comparison to NF stent. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions The review of two stent-assisted coiling devices using EP and NF stents including 1873 aneurysms in 1764 patients revealed that overall, it is safe and effective with comparable outcomes.

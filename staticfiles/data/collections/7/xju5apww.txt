The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States and around the world has required significant changes to medical practice. Amidst the rapidly evolving public health emergency, hospital centers have been required to postpone elective procedures, preserve personal protective equipment (PPE), practice social distancing and limit staff exposures. Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) often need urgent evaluation, most commonly for preprocedural evaluation. We have stratified the most common indications for cardiac computed tomography (CCT) imaging in patients with CHD to help guide care for these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic including considerations for reopening.

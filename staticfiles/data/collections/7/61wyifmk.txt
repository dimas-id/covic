Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery are now being used in gynecologic oncologic procedures. We used our expertise with LESS to perform nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. A 45-year-old woman with stage IA2 cervical cancer was referred to us. The biopsy specimen showed grade II invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. We duplicated the steps of our laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy procedure to perform a nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy via LESS using conventional ports and instruments. Oncologic clearance was comparable to that in conventional laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. Bladder function recovered completely after removal of the Foley catheter. Nerve-sparing laparoscopic radical hysterectomy using fewer ports is technically feasible. The oncologic clearance and functional results are comparable to those in the multiport variant.

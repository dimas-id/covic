Objective: To evaluate an applicability of lungs magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in viral pneumonia patients including, but not limited to, COVID-19 in a setting of computed tomography (CT) limited availability. Methods: The study included 11 patients (4 with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19). All of patients underwent an MRI scan of lungs using Single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE), LAVA 3D and IDEAL 3D, EPI Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and Fast Spin Echo (FSE) T2WI without using respiratory or any other trigger. 3 patients also had CT scan. All scans were analyzed for Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving signs indicating potential viral pneumonia. Results: In 8 (67%) patients foci and zones of slight compaction of the parenchyma were visualized as "cloudy sky sign" on T2WI. GGO zones on CT corresponded to "cloudy sky sign" on MRI in patients who underwent both MRI and CT. Conclusion: Lung MRI allows to identify the signs of viral pneumonia and estimate the severity of the disease and the volume of pulmonary involvement, "cloudy sky sign" on MRI corresponds to GGO in CT. The method could be used in COVID-19 diagnosis. Further research will allow to assess accuracy of MRI compared to CT.

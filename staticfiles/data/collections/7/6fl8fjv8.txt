PURPOSE To determine whether dogs with spontaneous chronic corneal epithelial defects (SCCEDs) would heal faster and with an improved comfort score following linear grid keratotomy (LGK) combined with corneal contact lens (Acrivet(™) ) wear when compared to dogs having the LGK procedure alone. STUDY DESIGN Prospective study. METHODS Twenty-seven boxer dogs (27 eyes) diagnosed with a SCCEDs were enrolled in the study. A LGK was performed on all dogs under dexmedetomidine and butorphanol sedation. Fourteen eyes were randomly assigned to receive a corneal contact lens. The dogs were evaluated typically at 7, 10, and 14 days or until the ulceration was healed. Client surveys were completed by the owners to subjectively assess comfort level and contact lens retention. Statistical analyses were performed utilizing generalized linear models and survival analysis with the Wilcoxon-Gehan test to evaluate group differences. RESULTS All ulcers healed after the LGK procedure. Dogs with bandage contact lenses had a statistically significant (P = 0.035) decrease in median healing time (7 days (95% CI [7,9]) compared to those without contact lenses (10 days (95% CI [7,12])). There was no difference in subjective comfort score between treatment groups. Early contact loss occurred in 28.6% (95% CI [8.4%, 58.1%]) of dogs. All of the Acrivet(™) ruler corneal measurements agreed to within 1 mm (95% CI [87.2%, 100%]) of the Jameson caliper measurements of horizontal corneal diameter. CONCLUSIONS The use of corneal bandage contact lenses significantly decreased median healing time although there was no effect on subjective comfort score. The Acrivet(™) ruler measurements were accurate in determining corneal diameter and therefore contact lens size.

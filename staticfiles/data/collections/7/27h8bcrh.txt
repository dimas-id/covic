In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of forced-air warming upper body blankets and forced-air warming underbody blankets on intraoperative hypothermia in patients who were planned to undergo open abdominal surgical operations in which extensive heat loss occurs. This prospective and randomized study included 92 patients who would undergo lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were randomized by closed envelope method and divided into two groups. Group I (n:46) included the patients who would receive warming with forced-air warming upper body blanket, and Group II (n:46) consisted of the patients who received warming with forced-air warming underbody blanket. Central body temperature was recorded by measuring with a temperature probe placed in distal esophagus. Demographic data, amount of fentanyl, crystalloid and blood products used, duration of operation, type of operation, hemodynamic parameters, shivering and thermal damage information were recorded. There was not any statistically significant difference among the patients in terms of demographic data, amount of fentanyl, crystalloid and blood products used, duration and type of operation and hemodynamic parameters. No difference was found between the groups in terms of body temperatures (Group I:36.1 °C, Group II:36.3 °C, respectively) (P > 0.05). Forced air warming underbody blanket can be as effective as forced-air warming upper body blankets in preventing intraoperative hypothermia. They can be alternative in cases where use of forced-air warming upper body blankets is not feasible.

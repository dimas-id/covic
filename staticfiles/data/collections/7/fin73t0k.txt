Acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations are common in young, active patients. In case of surgical indications, Rockwood type IV, type V and selected type III dislocation, we use modified Phemister procedure. At mid-term follow-up, by an average of 35.1 months, we reassessed the records of 14 patients surgically treated for acute AC dislocation from February 2007 to November 2010. In patients with a diagnosis of grade III lesion, indication for surgery was given on the basis of the patient's functional demand. Full recovery was obtained on average 3 months after surgery. Constant Score accounted for 92.7 points, mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score for 3.2 points, and mean Simple Shoulder Test Score for 11.4 points. X-ray findings were partial loss of reduction (9 cases), subclinic re-dislocation (2 cases), calcification (5 cases) and post-traumatic arthritis (2 cases). Modified Phemister is a reliable technique, technically easy, a low learning curve procedure and cheap with low hardware's costs.

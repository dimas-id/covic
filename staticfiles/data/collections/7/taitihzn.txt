An immunochromatographic strip was developed for the detection of an antibody against Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). Colloidal gold-labeled rabbit anti-pig immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as the detection reagent, and the PHEV recombinant antigens and goat anti-rabbit IgG were coated on the prototype strip and the control lines, respectively. The immunochromatographic strip was capable of specifically detecting PHEV antibodies in serum with a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer of 2 within 10 min. Storage of the strips at room temperature for 6 months or at 4°C for 12 months did not change their sensitivity and specificity. Using HI as a reference test, the relative specificity and sensitivity of the immunochromatographic strip were determined to be 93.41% and 98.42%, respectively. There was a strong agreement between the results obtained by HI and the immunochromatographic strips (κ = 0.926). Additionally, there was a strong agreement between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunochromatographic strips (κ = 0.929). When the immunochromatographic strip was used for serological diagnosis of 1,117 serum samples in Jilin Province in China, the seropositivity ranged from 6.5% in the Liaoyuan District to 81.6% in the Changchun District. Furthermore, many piglets were seropositive to PHEV, indicating the possible transfer of maternal antibodies via the colostrum. Based on the high specificity, sensitivity, and stability of the immunochromatographic strip, it would be suitable for on-site detection of PHEV antibodies in order to monitor PHEV infections in an animal population.

Antibodies to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) cross-react with turkey coronavirus (TCV) in immunofluorescence assay (IFA) indicating that IBV and TCV may share an amino acid sequence similarity. To determine its extent, the gene encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein of TCV was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from RNA purified from intestines of embryos of turkeys infected with various TCV isolates and from allantoic fluid of chicken embryos infected with IBV M41 strain, the obtained N genes were cloned, sequenced and compared with known sequences of N genes of five IBV strains. The primers for amplification were designed from the genome of IBV PCR products were obtained only from two of eight TCV isolates tested. It was found that the two TCV isolates were identical with five IBV strains by 90.1-94.1% at the N gene level. It was also observed that the N gene of eight TCV isolates originating from various regions of the USA could not be amplified by the primers designed from the N gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV).

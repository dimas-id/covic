The unique characteristics of polyolefins make them the best candidates in single use healthcare products, medical textiles, and water filters. Most medical textiles and polymeric materials used in hospitals and hotels are good media for cross-transmission of diseases since most microorganisms can survive on fibrous materials for several hours to several months. Use of medical devices with antimicrobial functions has been considered as a major avenue to fight against microbial infections. In addition, suitable packaging can slow the deterioration rate, and hence, extend the shelf-life of food. Physical and chemical incorporation of antimicrobial agents into polyolefins can be implemented in common polyolefin processing. In this chapter, antimicrobial polyolefins are summarized based on processes that were studied to incorporate biocides into the polymers. These processes include blending, coating, and chemical modifications.

Dissection of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is a rare disease, but in young patients is responsible for about 20% of cerebral events. We presented three different cases of ICA dissection, including one iatrogenic and two spontaneous ones, which were successfully managed endovascularly, with the use of different techniques, different protection devices and stents. In this article, the clinical management and details of procedures were described.

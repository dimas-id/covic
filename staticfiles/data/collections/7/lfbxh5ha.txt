The care of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been radically altered by COVID-19, especially in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic. Here we summarize how telemedicine, virtual visits, delayed transfusions, and chemotherapy, preferably selecting self-administered medications and visits by home healthcare workers, are employed to minimize exposure of our high-risk population of patients to the virus. The unique challenges of transplants during the pandemic and the consequences of an abrupt halt in all non-essential research activities are described. Not all the changes forced by COVID-19 are detrimental.

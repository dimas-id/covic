PURPOSE: AE37 and GP2 are HER2 derived peptide vaccines. AE37 primarily elicits a CD4+ response while GP2 elicits a CD8+ response against the HER2 antigen. These peptides were tested in a large randomized trial to assess their ability to prevent recurrence in HER2 expressing breast cancer patients. The primary analyses found no difference in 5-year overall disease-free survival (DFS) but possible benefit in subgroups. Here, we present the final landmark analysis. METHODS: In this 4-arm, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center phase II trial, disease-free node positive and high-risk node negative breast cancer patients enrolled after standard of care therapy. Six monthly inoculations of vaccine (VG) vs. control (CG) were given as the primary vaccine series with 4 boosters at 6-month intervals. Demographic, safety, immunologic, and DFS data were evaluated. RESULTS: 456 patients were enrolled; 154 patients in the VG and 147 in CG for AE37, 89 patients in the VG and 91 in CG for GP2. The AE37 arm had no difference in DFS as compared to CG, but pre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses showed a trend towards benefit in advanced stage (p = 0.132, HR 0.573 CI 0.275–1.193), HER2 under-expression (p = 0.181, HR 0.756 CI 0.499–1.145), and triple-negative breast cancer (p = 0.266, HR 0.443 CI 0.114–1.717). In patients with both HER2 under-expression and advanced stage, there was significant benefit in the VG (p = 0.039, HR 0.375 CI 0.142–0.988) as compared to CG. The GP2 arm had no significant difference in DFS as compared to CG, but on subgroup analysis, HER2 positive patients had no recurrences with a trend toward improved DFS (p = 0.052) in VG as compared to CG. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II trial reveals that AE37 and GP2 are safe and possibly associated with improved clinical outcomes of DFS in certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. With these findings, further evaluations are warranted of AE37 and GP2 vaccines given in combination and/or separately for specific subsets of breast cancer patients based on their disease biology.

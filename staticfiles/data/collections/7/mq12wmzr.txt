Teschovirus A belongs to the family Picornaviridae and is a causal agent of the disease Teschovirus encephalomyelitis and other infections that remain asymptomatic. The present study was performed to design epitope-based peptide vaccine against Teschovirus A by identifying the potential T cell and B-cell epitopes from capsid proteins (VP1, VP3 and VP2) of the virus using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches. In the current study, hexapeptide T-cell and octapeptide B-cell epitopes were analyzed for immunogenicity, antigenicity and hydrophilicity scores of each epitope. Each potential epitope was further characterized using ExPASy-ProtParam and Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD3) tools for determining various physical and chemical parameters of the epitope. One linear hexapeptide T-cell epitope, i.e., RPVNDE (epitope position 77–82) and one linear octapeptide B-cell epitope, i.e., AYSRSHPQ (236–243) were identified from the viral capsid protein as they possess the capability to raise effective immunogenic reaction in the host organism against the virus. Pharmaceutical industries could harness the results of this investigation to develop epitope-based peptide vaccines by loading the identified epitopes in combination with targeting signal peptides of T-cells and B-cells and then inserting the combination into virus like particle (vlp) or constructing subunit vaccines for further trial.

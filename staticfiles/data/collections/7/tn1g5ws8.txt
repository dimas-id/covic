OBJECTIVES: To explore the level and influencing factors of help-seeking behavior of returning to work in healthcare Workers (HCWs). METHODS: A total of 861 HCWs were surveyed. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the influencing factors of help-seeking behavior. RESULTS: HCWs sought help with respect to COVID-19-diagnosised problem most. Help-seeking intention, problems encountered after return, test for return, work condition during COVID-19, relatives or friends diagnosed or suspected as COVID-19 and socio-demographic characteristics such as occupation, education, title and marriage status are predictors of help-seeking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Education and intervention should lay particular stress on HCWs featured rest at home before return, doctor, lower education and lower title to ensure the safety, accuracy and quality of work after they return to work for a better occupational environment.

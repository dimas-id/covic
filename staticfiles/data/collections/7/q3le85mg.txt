The impact of different neuronal populations on local cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation is not well known and insight into these relationships could enhance the interpretation of brain function and dysfunction from brain imaging data. We investigated the role of sub-types of inhibitory neuron activity on the regulation of CBF using optogenetics, laser Doppler flowmetry and different transgenic mouse models (parvalbumin (PV), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SOM) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)). Whisker stimulation was used to verify that typical CBF responses were obtained in all mice. Photo-stimulation of SOM-cre and NOS-cre mice produced significant increases in CBF that were similar to whisker responses. In NOS-cre mice, CBF responses scaled with the photo-stimulus pulse duration and frequency. In SOM-cre mice, CBF increases were followed by decreases. In VIP-cre mice, photo-stimulation did not consistently produce significant changes in CBF, while slower increases in CBF that peaked 14â€“18 s after stimulation onset were observed in PV-cre mice. Control experiments performed in non-expressing regions showed no changes in CBF. These findings suggest that dysfunction in NOS or SOM neurons can have a significant impact on vascular responses that are detected by brain imaging methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

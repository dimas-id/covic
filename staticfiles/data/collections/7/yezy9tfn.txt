BACKGROUND Respiratory viruses are the most frequent triggers of acute asthma exacerbations. Herein we investigate costimulatory molecule expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during such exacerbations. METHODS Eleven children with atopic asthma were followed prospectively and respiratory symptoms were recorded on diary cards. A blood sample and nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) were obtained at baseline and subsequently during an exacerbation. PBMC were immunophenotyped using flow cytometry. NPW samples were examined for the presence of respiratory viruses by RT-PCR. RESULTS A virus was detected in 73% of exacerbations and none at baseline. A drop of NK cells and a marginal increase of monocytes were the only changes of cell count during the exacerbation. A significant downregulation of B7-2 on NK cells and of B7-1 on monocytes was also observed during exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS The above observations are in contrast to in vitro findings showing an upregulation of costimulatory molecules after exposure of blood cells to viruses or allergens. It is possible that activated immune cells leave the blood stream to migrate to the inflammation site during acute asthma exacerbations.

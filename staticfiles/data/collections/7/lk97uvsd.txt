OBJECTIVE To describe and compare fluoroscopic guidance for placement of wide-bore thoracostomy tubes (FGTT) to traditional, blind placement of thoracostomy tubes (BPTT). STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Twenty client-owned dogs. METHODS Dogs requiring medical management of pleural effusion received a BPTT, whereas dogs undergoing postoperative management of pneumothorax and/or pleural fluid after lateral thoracotomy received an FGTT. Time of placement, accuracy of positioning, radiation exposure, and complications were compared between groups. RESULTS Initial placement of BPTT took a mean of 168 seconds (range, 89-197), whereas adequate placement was radiographically confirmed at 20 minutes and 38 seconds (range, 7 minutes and 57 seconds to 39 min). Initial placement of FGTT took a mean time of 108 seconds (range, 50-341, P = .17), and adequate placement was confirmed at 125 seconds (range, 50-341, P < .001). Major errors in placement requiring removal and replacement occurred in 2 dogs for BPTT and in none for FGTT. Procedural complications did not differ between groups, and no postoperative complication occurred within the first 12 hours after placement. Radiation entrance surface dose was lower in the BPTT group (P = .004), but stochastic radiation doses did not differ. CONCLUSION Fluoroscopic guidance of wide-bore thoracostomy tubes accelerated the time to accurate tube placement and alleviated the requirement for removal and replacement in this population. Although use of fluoroscopy increased radiation entrance surface dose, the dose was not clinically significant. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Fluoroscopic guidance of wide-bore thoracostomy tubes should be considered as an alternative to traditional, blind placement.

Nuclear structure alterations in cancer involve global genetic (mutations, amplifications, copy number variations, translocations, etc.) and epigenetic (DNA methylation and histone modifications) events that dramatically and dynamically spatially change chromatin, nuclear body, and chromosome organization. In prostate cancer (CaP) there appears to be early (<50 years) versus late (>60 years) onset clinically significant cancers, and we have yet to clearly understand the hereditary and somatic-based molecular pathways involved. We do know that once cancer is initiated, dedifferentiation of the prostate gland occurs with significant changes in nuclear structure driven by numerous genetic and epigenetic processes. This review focuses upon the nuclear architecture and epigenetic dynamics with potential translational clinically relevant applications to CaP. Further, the review correlates changes in the cancer-driven epigenetic process at the molecular level and correlates these alterations to nuclear morphological quantitative measurements. Finally, we address how we can best utilize this knowledge to improve the efficacy of personalized treatment of cancer.

INTRODUCTION Minimally invasive laparoscopic liver surgery is being performed with increased frequency. Lesions located on the anterior and lateral liver segments are easier to approach through laparoscopy. On the other hand, laparoscopic access to posterior and superior segments is less frequent and technically demanding. AIM Technical description for laparoscopic transthoracic access employed on hepatic wedge resection. TECHNIQUE Laparoscopic transthoracic hepatic wedge resection on segment 8. CONCLUSION Transthoracic approach allows access to the posterior and superior segments of the liver, and should be considered for oddly located tumors and in patients with numerous previous abdominal interventions.

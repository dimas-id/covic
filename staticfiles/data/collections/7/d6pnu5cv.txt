BACKGROUND Umbilical hernias (UH) are common in postpartum patients seeking abdominal contouring surgery and the question of simultaneous abdominoplasty and UH repair is raised. This presents, however, a risk to the umbilicus vascularisation with possible umbilical necrosis. To minimize this risk we associated abdominoplasty with laparoscopic UH repair. The aim of this study was to present the technique of simultaneous abdominoplasty and UH repair and the first results. MATERIALS AND METHODS Simultaneous abdominoplasty and laparoscopic mesh UH repair was analysed in the first 10 cases. The intervention was performed by a plastic surgeon and a general surgeon. It begins as a standard abdominoplasty with flap elevation, umbilicus detachment and diastasis repair, if indicated. The second stage is the UH repair via laparoscopy using an intraperitoneal mesh. The third stage consists of umbilical transposition and closure of the abdominoplasty incision. RESULTS We had no complications at the umbilicus or the hernia mesh. In all cases, umbilical vascularisation was preserved and no hernia recurrence was noted. CONCLUSIONS Our first results suggest that the simultaneous UH repair with abdominoplasty is safe, minimizing the risk to the umbilicus blood supply. These first results encourage us to recommend this approach and perform a more detailed analysis of the whole series since our first case.

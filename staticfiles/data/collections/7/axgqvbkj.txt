Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Future research on the molecular virology of SARS-CoV will be important in the understanding of the epidemiology and the natural history of SARS. This will also facilitate the development of sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests, as well as vaccination and other therapeutics to combat SARS.

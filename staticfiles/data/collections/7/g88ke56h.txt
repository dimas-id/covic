COVID-19 has led to many unprecedented situations across the world. With lockdowns and severe restrictions on movement and activities, countries have managed to slow down the COVID curve but developing countries like India are likely to face a humongous task of containing the virus spread in coming months. High population density, continuing economic activities, movement of people etc. will keep causing newer hotspots across India. We look at the compounded daily growth rates (CDGR) of USA, Spain, India and Brazil over the duration of the virus spread since January, 2020. We also analyze the correlation between the total cases and active cases across India. We estimate the projected number of beds, ICU beds, oxygen support and ventilators for different CDGRs in the coming months and also define a metric target to control the virus spread through various preventive measures.

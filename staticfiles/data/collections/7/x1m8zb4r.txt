A blocking-ELISA procedure was used to quantify antibodies in sera of humans immunized with poliovirus vaccines. Titers determined by this method demonstrated an excellent correlation with the results of neutralization test. Testing of serum potency with a panel of type 1 poliovirus strains altered antigenically was used to evaluate the composition of polyclonal sera with respect to the epitope specificity of constituent antibodies. Paratope profiles of various polyclonal sera determined by this new method differed, depending on the type of vaccine used for immunization. Antibodies induced in response to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) contained antibodies directed primarily against antigenic site 1, while sera from recipients of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) contained antibodies to site 3. Antibodies to antigenic sites 2 and 4 were minor constituents in both types of sera. Pre-immunization sera had paratope profiles similar to OPV-induced antisera, allowing the discrimination between antibodies induced by IPV and maternal antibodies. The new method may be useful for analyzing results of clinical trials and to compare immunity induced by different poliovirus vaccines.

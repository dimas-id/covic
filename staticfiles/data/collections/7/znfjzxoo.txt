A significant number of jobs require highly skilled labor which necessitate training on pre-requisite knowledge. Examples include jobs in military, technical field such computer science, large scale fulfillment centers such as Amazon. Moreover, making such jobs accessible to the disabled population requires even more pre-requisite training such as knowledge of sign language. An artificial intelligent (AI) agent can potentially act as a tutor for such pre-requisite training. This will not only reduce resource requirements for such training but also decrease the time taken for making personnel job ready. In this paper, we develop an AI tutor that can teach users gestures that are required on the field as a pre-requisite. The AI tutor uses a model learning technique that learns the gestures performed by experts. It then uses a model comparison technique to compare a learner with the expert gesture and provides feedback for the learner to improve.

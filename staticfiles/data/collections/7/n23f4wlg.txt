Feasibility of endovascular stentectomy using a snare over stent-retriever (SOS) technique was evaluated in a silicon flow model and an in vivo swine model. In vitro, stentectomy of different intracranial stents using the SOS technique was feasible in 22 out of 24 (92%) retrieval maneuvers. In vivo, stentectomy was successful in 10 out of 10 procedures (100%). In one case self-limiting vasospasm was observed angiographically as a technique related complication in the animal model. Endovascular stentectomy using the SOS technique is feasible in an experimental setting and may be transferred to a clinical scenario.

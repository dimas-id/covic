Abstract To study the roles of hypervariable regions (HVRs) in receptor-binding subunit S1 of the spike protein, we manipulated the genome of the IBV Beaudette strain using a reverse genetics system to construct seven recombinant strains by separately or simultaneously replacing the three HVRs of the Beaudette strain with the corresponding fragments from a QX-like nephropathogenic isolate ck/CH/LDL/091022 from China. We characterized the growth properties of these recombinant IBVs in Vero cells and embryonated eggs, and their pathogenicity, tropism, and serotypes in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. All seven recombinant IBVs proliferated in Vero cells, but the heterogenous HVRs could reduce their capacity for adsorption during in vitro infection. The recombinant IBVs did not significantly increase the pathogenicity compared with the Beaudette strain in SPF chickens, and they still shared the same serotype as the Beaudette strain, but the antigenic relatedness values between the recombinant strain and Beaudette strain generally decreased with the increase in the number of the HVRs exchanged. The results of this study demonstrate the functions of HVRs and they may help to develop a vaccine candidate, as well as providing insights into the prevention and control of IBV.

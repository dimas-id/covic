Introduction: Gallstones are an etiological factor in 23%-54% of patients with acute pancreatitis. A small proportion of these patients will also have intestinal complications requiring necrosectomy with diverting loop ileostomy. Later, these patients require cholecystectomy and ileostomy reversal. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is fraught with difficulty in these patients due to dense intra-abdominal adhesions, and many surgeons resort to an open approach. We describe a technique which takes advantage of the ileostomy site for initial access. Materials and Surgical Technique Ileostomy reversal is done and a SILS™ (Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts, USA) port is inserted under direct vision, through the ileostomy site. Adhesiolysis is done through the SILS™ port. Additional ports are inserted and standard steps are followed for cholecystectomy. Conclusion The use of ileostomy incision as the first port facilitates adhesiolysis and subsequent port placement in the hostile abdomen encountered in these patients. We describe a novel technique of ileostomy reversal and laparoscopic cholecystectomy using SILS™ port.

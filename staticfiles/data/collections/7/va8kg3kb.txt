We demonstrate that the general clinical conditions, risk factors and numerous pathological and biological features of COVID-19 are analogous with various disorders caused by the uncontrolled formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and their by-products. Given the rapid evolution of this disease's symptoms and its lethality, we hypothesize that SARS-CoV2 evades innate immune response causing COVID-19 progresses under just such an amplifier loop, leading to a massive, uncontrolled inflammation process. This work allows us to propose new strategies for treating the pandemic.

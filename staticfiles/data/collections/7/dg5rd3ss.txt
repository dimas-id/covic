A 53-yr-old woman presented with abdominal pain. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and an endocrinologic work-up revealed a 4-cm nonfunctional left adrenal mass. A TriPort laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed. The TriPort was inserted through a 3-cm subcostal incision. Using 5-mm instruments, a left adrenalectomy was performed. The specimen was dissected (harmonic scalpel) and extracted through a 10-mm bag. A TriPort adrenalectomy was successfully completed in 240 min (blood loss: 20 ml). The postoperative period was uneventful (discharge within 3 d). In our opinion, the TriPort adrenalectomy is feasible and safe, with favourable perioperative and short-term outcomes and a delighted patient at the 8-mo follow-up.

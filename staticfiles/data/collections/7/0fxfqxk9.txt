In cancer patients, fungal diseases are rare but remains an important complication. Chemotherapy or surgery procedures are often delayed or postponed in patients with fungal disease which might lead to impaired overall survival. Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and Pneumocystis jirovecii have accounted for most of yeast and mold infections reported in cancer patients. We have to know each risk factor and clinical picture. Early diagnosis strategies improve cancer outcomes. Recently immune checkpoint inhibitors(ICIs)-anti-PD-1(nivolumab, pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1(atezolizumab, avelumab), anti- CTLA-4(ipilimumab)-have improved outcomes for several malignancies. Use of these drugs is associated with immunerelated adverse effects, requirement for immunosuppressive therapy. Prolonged immunosuppressive therapies may increase fungal diseases.

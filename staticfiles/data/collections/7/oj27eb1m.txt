INTRODUCTION Aim of this study was to evaluate the use of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) in the prevention of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer. METHODS From a prospective database, all patients operated between 2010 and 2014 received IPC in addition to LMWH and were compared to a historical cohort of patients treated LMWH only (2004-2009). RESULTS Of the 313 included patients, 195 (62%) received IPC. Patients with IPC received neoadjuvant chemoradiation more often (45% vs. 3%, P < 0.001), whereas, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was equally distributed (31% vs. 34%, P = 0.631). There were no differences with regard to surgical approach, operative time, blood loss, and ICU stay. Patients treated without IPC had a longer hospital stay (18 vs. 15 days, P = 0.014). Overall, 12 clinical VTE's occurred in 11 patients, which consisted of two deep venous thromboses and 10 pulmonary embolisms. In the group of patients, who received IPC 1.5% developed a symptomatic VTE compared to 6.8% in patients without IPC (OR = 0.215; 95% CI = 0.06-0.83). Multivariate analysis identified IPC as the only independent prognostic factor correlated with a reduction in postoperative VTE's (OR = 0.225; 95% CI = 0.06-0.88). CONCLUSION The addition of IPC in patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer was associated with a reduction in symptomatic VTE's. J. Surg. Oncol. 2017;115:181-185. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

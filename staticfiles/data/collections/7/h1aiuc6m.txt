Mutations are the driving force of evolution and the source of important pathologies. The characterization of the dynamics and effects of mutations on fitness is therefore central to our understanding of evolution and to human health. This protocol describes how to implement two methods that we recently developed: mutation visualization (MV) and microfluidic mutation accumulation (µMA), which allow the occurrence of mutations created by DNA replication errors (MV) and the evolution of cell fitness during MA (µMA) to be followed directly in individual cells of Escherichia coli. MV provides a quantitative characterization of the dynamics of mutation occurrences, and µMA allows precise estimation of the distribution of fitness effects (DFEs) of mutations. Both methods use microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, and a fluorescent mismatch repair (MMR) MutL protein is used as a marker for nascent mutations. Here, we present a single protocol describing how to implement the MV and µMA methods, including detailed procedures for microfluidic setup installation, data acquisition and data analysis and interpretation. Using this procedure, the microfluidic setup installation can be completed within 1 d, and automated data acquisition takes 2-4 d.

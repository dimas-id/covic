Mask ventilation is lifesaving, especially in cases of difficult intubation. Many publications have offered distinct techniques for optimizing mask ventilation. This article reviews currently available difficult mask ventilation literature and theory. We divide difficult mask ventilation into 3 broad categories based on etiology: inadequate mask seal, increased airway resistance, and decreased respiratory compliance. Published strategies for overcoming difficulty are presented and organized by etiology.

The all-round and multilevel responses to the epidemic, with professional medical institutions, the governments and the public as the main agents of response and the media as the bridge of communication, are key to developing the public health emergency management system with regard to emerging infectious diseases and diseases with unknown etiology in the information age. This study creates an analysis framework concerning the five dimensions of information—the epidemic itself and the medical, governmental, public and media responses—and analyzes the evolution, interaction and trends of five dimensions using big data within the period of observation For the four dimensions other than the media response, the level of information related to the epidemic and the medical response is relatively high, while the level of response by medical institutions and the governments are similar, and both are higher than the public response. The media coverage of the epidemic remains at a high level of information. In relation to such diseases, the government should take the role of big data analytics seriously, lead a multi-agent social collaboration network, and further strengthen the ‘One Planning Plus Three Systems’ framework related to emergency management in China.

BACKGROUND: Early administration of colostrum may provide preterm infants with immune components. Previous studies illustrating the effects of oral colostrum (OC) have been confounded by the coincidence of enteral feedings. OBJECTIVE: To quantify OC absorption, as measured by urinary sIgA and lactoferrin, in preterm infants prior to enteral feedings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Colostrum was obtained from mothers delivering infants ≤32 weeks and ≤1500 g. sIgA and lactoferrin were measured in infant urine, and microflora in saliva and tracheal aspirates were characterized. RESULTS: Urinary sIgA and lactoferrin were significantly greater in infants receiving OC by syringe compared to swab (p < 0.002). Urinary sIgA correlated with the total number of doses in 72 h (R(2) = 43%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of OC by syringe and higher cumulative dose are associated with increased absorption of sIgA and lactoferrin, and early dosing may contribute to a more diverse tracheal microbiome.

In this study, the prevalence and spatial distribution of Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, and avian influenza have been evaluated in commercial broiler farms in 31 provinces in Iran. In this survey, a total of 233 affected broiler chicken farms were sampled. The infectious bronchitis virus (alone) was detected with highest frequency in 60 farms, and separately or combined with other agents, in 110 farms; Newcastle disease virus, separately, was detected in 28 farms, and in 63 farms separately or combined with other infectious agents; and avian influenza H9N2 was detected in 22 farms separately and in 51 farms separately or concomitant with other infectious agents. The sample tested negative for all H5 serotypes. The results of the present study show that the most prevalent avian viral infectious disease contributing to respiratory syndromes in broiler farms in Iran was infectious bronchitis due to infectious bronchitis virus serotypes variant 2 and 793/B. On the other hand, combined with the alternation of dominant viruses and circulating strains, flocks are exposed to unremitting anamorphic viral infections. Thus, the permanent monitoring of cases that have occurred and the review of vaccination plans of affected flocks every year are some of the necessary measures needed for strategic control of respiratory syndrome in broilers. It is noteworthy that execution of epidemiologic examinations on the cogent factors of prevalence of this syndrome and defeat of vaccination strategy in the flocks is urgent and has to be fulfilled on the definite causes of time.

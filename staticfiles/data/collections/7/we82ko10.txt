BACKGROUND Conventional treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities by anticoagulation alone has been proven to be insufficient to prevent recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valvular function by endovascular surgery has been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) against catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. METHODS Three hundred sixty-nine articles were identified through screening of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 2006 to December 2016. RESULTS Fifteen retrospective studies and one prospective registry, totalling 1170 patients, were recruited for qualitative synthesis. The venous patency rate ranged from 75% to 100% with mean follow-up of 12.3 months. The rates of PTS and recurrent DVT were less than 17% and 15%, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 0.26%. Compared with CDT, PMT was shown to reduce PTS at 1 year (Villalta score: 2.1 ± 3.0 in the PMT group and 5.1 ± 4.1 in the CDT group, P=0.03) and bleeding complications (packed cells transfused: 0.2 ± 0.3 units in the pharmacomechanical thrombectomy group and 1.2 ± 0.7 units in the CDT group, P<0.05). CONCLUSION Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in terms of restoration of venous patency, prevention of DVT recurrence, and PTS. Compared with CDT alone, PMT offers a lower risk of PTS and bleeding complications.

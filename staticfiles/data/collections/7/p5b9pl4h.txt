Aim: Since 2012 and to date, outbreak/new cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were always reported in Saudi Arabia. Al-Jouf region is considered as one of the most vulnerable areas to the disease outbreak. This research aimed to assess (to the best of our knowledge), for the first time, the current level of awareness towards MERS-CoV among the Al-Jouf region population through a well-designed multistage questionnaire. Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study of 384 participants recruited from various places in Al-Jouf government was conducted through a valid and reliable questionnaire including sociodemographic and MERS-CoV knowledge data. Results: The majority of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about MERS-CoV. Age, education, and occupation were the only significant predictors of the level of low awareness concern. Also, the public awareness about the nature, communicability, and lethal effect of the disease was good overall; however, knowledge about incubation period, clinical picture, and epidemiology of the disease needs more governmental concern. The Ministry of Health was the main source of information. Conclusion: Empowering public information regarding the incubation period and epidemiology of the disease is needed. Frequent communication between healthcare providers and both school students and non-educated individuals is recommended to help the Saudi government in controlling the disease outbreak.

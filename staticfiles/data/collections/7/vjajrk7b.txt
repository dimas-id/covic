BACKGROUND Enterostomy may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalance, or impaired absorption of nutrition followed by impairment of growth. This study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of enteral refeeding (ER) in premature and full-term neonates. METHODS A retrospective database of all consecutive neonates who had enterostomy during 2000-2014 in a regional center was analyzed. Thirteen patients with ER (ER group) and 14 patients without ER (control group) were included. Detailed clinical data were evaluated with reference to the increment in body weight during ER. RESULTS The ER group had a significantly higher rate in weight gain compared with the control group (P=0.0012), despite the gestational age (<37weeks: P=0.0012, â‰¥37weeks: P=0.029). ER starting at a lower body weight was also associated with a higher weight gain (P=0.0002). Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that only the ER procedure (P<0.0001) and birth weight (P=0.049) were significantly independent predictors of good weight gain. CONCLUSIONS Using ER, low-birth-weight infants may have benefits, such as better acceleration of growth, than normal-birth-weight infants. We do not hesitate to perform ER, even in low-birth-weight neonates or those with low body weight, when starting ER.

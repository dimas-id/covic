OBJECTIVE To evaluate the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation III (APACHE III) and acute lung injury (ALI) scale in the severity and prognosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS The clinical data of 38 SARS patients, including survivors (24 cases) and no survivors (14 cases) were collected and evaluated with APACHE III and ALI scoring systems. The correlation of scores and prognosis was evaluated. RESULTS The scores of APACHE III in the non survivors were higher remarkably than those in the survivor group (P < 0.001). The scores of APACHE III had positive correlation with the overall fatality rate. When the scores of APACHE III was higher than 60, the mortality increased obviously (chi(2) = 3.886, P < 0.05). Elderly patients with SARS who were over 60 years old had a high mortality (chi(2) = 8.660, P < 0.05). The scores of ALI in the non survivors had not statistical significance than those in the survivor group (P = 0.127). CONCLUSIONS The score of APACHE III in the SARS are correlated with the patient's condition and prognosis. Elderly patients with SARS have a high mortality.

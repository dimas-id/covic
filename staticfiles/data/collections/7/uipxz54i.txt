Hemorrhagic disease associated with elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus infection is the most-frequent cause of mortality in captive Asian elephants ( Elephas maximus). Survival relies on intensive monitoring of hemostatic status. Thromboelastography (TEG) utilizes whole blood samples containing all the blood components of hemostasis and is therefore a sensitive indicator of the clinical status in the patient. This study was performed to assess the practicability of TEG in Asian elephants in a zoo environment. Citrated stabilized whole blood samples were obtained from 44 healthy Asian elephants. Kaolin-activated TEG was performed on whole blood at 60 min and 24 hr postsampling (to replicate shipment to an external laboratory) as well as on freeze-thawed plasma samples, 12-14 mo postsampling. Reference intervals were calculated for fresh whole blood and freeze-thawed plasma samples. In the 24-hr analysis, storage artifacts, likely due to cellular degeneration, resulted in a hypercoagulable thromboelastogram and thus reduced sensitivity for detecting coagulopathies. Therefore, delayed analysis of whole blood samples is not recommended.

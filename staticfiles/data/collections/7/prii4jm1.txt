Cancer pain was observed in 131 of 160 patients with advanced cancer living at home. Oxycodone or morphine was administered to patients suffering from cancer pain or fentanyl transdermal patch was switched to morphine. Subsequently, 70 patients were found to have alleviation of symptoms such as nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, abdominal fullness, general fatigue, cough, and urinary urgency in addition to pain. Pain was defined as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage by the International Association for the Study of Pain. This definition of pain is cited in a lot of books. However, the author was unable to intervene with detailed reports of unpleasant sensations associated with tissue damage. Therefore, here the author reports about an unpleasant sensation caused by tissue damage of cancer that was alleviated by oxycodone or morphine.

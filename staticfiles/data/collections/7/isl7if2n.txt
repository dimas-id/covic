The adequacy of cerebral blood flow and the level of regional oxygen saturation during CPR and early post-resuscitation phases assuring favorable neurological outcome are not known. We demonstrate the feasibility of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation monitoring by a continuous transcranial Doppler combined with cerebral oximetry in a patient with refractory cardiac arrest treated by extracorporeal life support.

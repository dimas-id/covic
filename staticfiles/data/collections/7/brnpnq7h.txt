• We describe a patient with acute disseminated encephalitis and COVID-19. • CNS manifestations primarily occurred without evident pulmonary symptoms. • Brain MRI of the patient indicated diffuse confluent white matter hyperintensities. • The patient initially responded to steroids but lastly, died of status epilepticus. • The occurrence of acute disseminated encephalitis may have been immune-mediated.

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pandemic condition was declared by the WHO on March 11, 2020. The main clinical symptoms are fever, dry cough and dyspnea, although new symptoms are emerging, such as diarrhea, anosmia and ageusia. The virus enters cells, likely including those lining blood vessels, by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the cell surface. Infection can also promote blood clots, heart attacks and cardiac inflammation.

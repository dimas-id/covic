In an era of increasing emphasis on minimally invasive surgery, distal embolization remains a concern in the absence of distal flow control. We present a case using an endovascular flow control technique that can be used for reducing distal embolic events during endovascular recanalization of aortoiliac occlusive disease. This technique has been used in four patients so far (two with native anatomy and two with aorto-bi-iliac grafts) with no evidence of angiographic or clinical embolic complications.

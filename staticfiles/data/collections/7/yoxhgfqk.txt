The novel coronavirus disease outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2012 predominately affected males and those living in urban areas. Since September and October 2012, when the first 2 cases were published, a total of 15 confirmed cases have been reported. All but 2 have been linked to conuntries of the Arabian peninsula; Saudi Arabian nationals accounted for a majority, 8 in all, and only 1 case was female. Seven patients had severe pneumonia; 2 survived-1 with mild disease and 1 with significant underlying illness. Although transmission of the virus to health-care workers was suspected in Jordan's April 2012 outbreak, similar clusters have not been found in Saudi Arabia's hospitals, nor have additional cases been indentified through retrospective tracing of exposed health-care workers. Two family clusters have been identified, 1 in Riyadh and 1 in Manchester, England. A second Riyadh family cluster is being investigated.

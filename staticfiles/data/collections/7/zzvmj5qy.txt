The global Covid-19 pandemic has the potential to lead to significant training disruptions affecting surgical residents across all specialties. There has been lively social media discussion about the impact of cancelled training activities under the twitter hashtag #NoTrainingTodayNoSurgeonsTomorrow. We present a rapid scoping review synthesising the current evidence of pandemic-related impact on surgical training in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We describe and compare strategies that have been put in place to mitigate disruption, and reflect on how the challenges of the pandemic may present the opportunity to improve on how we select, assess and train surgeons in the future.

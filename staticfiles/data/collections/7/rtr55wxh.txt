BACKGROUND COVID-19 poses many challenges to healthcare systems and workers. Responding to medical emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19 will require new guidelines and protocols. Simulation can support their development. METHODS We organised seven simulations involving patients with suspected COVID-19 for staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. RESULTS Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures. CONCLUSIONS Low-fidelity simulation can provide relevant and timely information on how prepared health systems and their workforce are to respond to emergencies. We urge NHS trusts nationally to implement simulations to identify problems and develop effective solutions.

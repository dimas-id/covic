OBJECTIVE: To evaluate stress effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Zagreb earthquakes on symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and two previously diagnosed TMD patients were contacted by email to participate in an online survey about impact of those events on current and/or new symptoms, perceived stress, anxiety and symptom intensity in time-points at the baseline, following pandemic and following earthquake. We compared data between earthquake-affected and non-affected respondents. RESULTS: Response rate was 79.4%. Effects stress had on deterioration of symptoms were significantly different between earthquake-affected and non-affected (p = .024). In earthquake-affected, numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) scores significantly increased between baseline and after COVID-19 (p > .001) and between baseline and after earthquakes (p > .05). However, scores insignificantly dropped from COVID-19 to after earthquakes time-points. In earthquake-affected, positive correlation was found between impact of COVID-19 on stress and NPRS (p < .001) and between earthquakes' impact on stress and NPRS (p < .001). Earthquake-affected respondents reported significantly more new behavioral habits when compared to non-affected (p = .048). CONCLUSIONS: A series of stressful events do not necessarily have a cumulative effect, but are likely to have a complex interaction (e.g., acute stress might trigger the protective mechanisms), which could have decreased pain scores after the earthquakes.

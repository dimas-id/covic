A 4-month-old boy with a history of muscular ventricular septal defect and atopic dermatitis presented with decreased oral intake, loose stools, stuffy nose, mild cough and diaphoresis. The patient had an in-home exposure to COVID-19. The initial respiratory pathogen panel was positive for adenovirus, consistent with his symptoms. The following day, the COVID-19 PCR was also positive. The patient was treated with supportive care, isolation precautions were implemented and the patient was discharged on day 4. This case demonstrates the importance of testing for COVID-19 even if a patient tests positive for another virus due to the possibility of coinfection, especially in children, in order to limit spread of COVID-19 to others.

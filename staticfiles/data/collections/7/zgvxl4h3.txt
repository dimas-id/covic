Abstract Recently, AdvanSure™ kit based on multiplex real-time PCR was developed for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (RVs). We compared the performance of AdvanSure with those of Seeplex® RV 15 ACE and culture by determining their sensitivities and specificities against a composite reference standard. Four hundred thirty-seven respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV 15 ACE, and AdvanSure. One hundred fourteen samples (26.2%) out of 437 samples were positive by culture, while additional 91 (20.8%) were positive by AdvanSure or RV15. One hundred twelve of 114 culture-positive samples were positive by AdvanSure except 2 samples (1 adenovirus, 1 respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Overall, the sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 74.5%, 89.8%, and 95.1%, respectively. Sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure for each virus tested were as follows: 91/100/96% for influenza A, 60/0/100% for influenza B, 63/95/97% for RSV, 69/81/89% for adenovirus, and 87/93/93% for parainfluenza virus. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV15 and AdvanSure were as follows: 77/88% for rhinovirus, 100/100% for coronavirus OC43, 40/100% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 13/100% for metapneumovirus, and 44/100% for bocavirus. The overall specificities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 100/98.9/99.5%, respectively. Of 45 coinfected specimens, AdvanSure detected 41 specimens (91.1%) as coinfected, while RV15 detected 27 specimens (60.0%) as coinfected. AdvanSure assay demonstrated exquisite performance for the detection of RVs and will be a valuable tool for the management of RV infection.

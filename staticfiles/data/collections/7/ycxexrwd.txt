Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has never been more clear that the healthcare needs of the population, and the technical and scientific advances with which to solve them, are rapidly evolving and the medical workforce must adapt to these changes to deliver personalised healthcare. This article considers the current challenges that need to be addressed to deliver a future physician-led healthcare service that works for its patients. Key themes are expanded upon, including the changing healthcare workforce, digital and technological innovation, service delivery, complex conditions and changing patient demographics.

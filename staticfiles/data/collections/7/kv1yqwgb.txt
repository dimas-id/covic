BACKGROUND Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for acute ischemic stroke and show some advantages. However, the data of predicting clinical outcome after thrombectomy with Solitaire retriever were limited. We attempt to identify prognostic factors of clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing thrombectomy with Solitaire retriever. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive acute ischemic strokes cases treated between December 2010 and December2013 where the Solitaire stent retriever was used for acute ischemic stroke. We assessed the effect of selected demographic characteristics, clinical factors on poor outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin score 3-6), mortality at 3 months, and hemorrhage within 24 h (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Clinical, imaging and logistic variables were analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables influencing clinical outcome, based on discharge NIHSS score change and mRS at 3 months. RESULTS Eighty nine consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Multivariate analysis revealed that admission NIHSS score, Serum glucose and endovascular procedure duration were independently associated with clinical outcome. Sex, NIHSS score at admission, diabetes and time of operation were associated with sICH in 1 day. NIHSS score â‰¥20 (OR 9.38; 95% CI 2.41-36.50), onset to reperfusion >5 hours (OR 5.23; 95% CI1.34,20.41) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR 10.19; 95% CI1.80,57.83) were potential predictive factors of mortality at 3 months. CONCLUSION Multiple pre- and intra-procedural factors can be used to predict clinical outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality in acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing endovascular therapy. This knowledge is helpful for patients selection for endovascular mechanical thrombectomy.

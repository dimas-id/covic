Introduction The use of implants in inguinal hernia repair has reduced its recurrence rate. However, postoperative groin pain still remains an unresolved problem. There are suggestions that in totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP-IHR) two of the likely factors responsible for pain are use of fixation and the type of fixation used. Aim To evaluate the impact of mesh fixation on the incidence of postoperative pain, restriction of physical activities, hernia recurrence risk, return to normal activities and demand for analgesics in patients after unilateral TEP-IHR. Material and methods Unilateral TEP-IHR was performed in 139 male patients randomized to three groups: self-gripping mesh (SG), lightweight mesh (L) and lightweight mesh with fixation (LF). Full study-inclusion criteria were met by 110 patients; 43, 18 and 49 in groups SG, L and LF respectively. Follow-up occurred on the 1st, 2nd, and 7th day and 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively. The numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain and the EuraHS-QoL (European Registry for Abdominal Wall Hernias Quality of Life Score) questionnaire to compare quality of life (QoL) prior to surgery and one year later. Results No statistically significant differences were observed between study groups with regard to the incidence rate and intensity of acute post-operative pain, chronic pain, analgesic demand, return to normal activity, hernia recurrence rate and post-operative QoL. Conclusions Lack of fixation in TEP-IHR does not increase the risk of hernia recurrence, and its presence does not significantly worsen the treatment results; especially it does not increase the incidence of chronic pain.

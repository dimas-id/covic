Eight animals underwent fusion podoplasties for the treatment of chronic interdigital furunculosis (n=3), ectrodactyly (n=1), digit abnormalities associated with tendonectomy (n=1), redundant indertigital skin (n=1), conformational deformity (n=1), and necrotizing fasciitis of the paw (n=1). Median duration of bandaging was 14 days, and median duration of hospitalization was 5 days. Four dogs had dehiscence, which occurred at a mean time of 11 days after surgery. Clinical abnormalities necessitating podoplasty resolved in six animals and improved in two. Six animals had normal ambulation and two dogs had slight weight-bearing lameness after a median follow-up time of 29 mo. Fusion podoplasty may be recommended as a salvage procedure for the treatment of various chronic pedal diseases in dogs and cats.

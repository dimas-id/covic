BACKGROUND To report a new surgical technique for hysterectomy using robotic natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) as a scarless and gasless procedure. METHODS Thirteen consecutive patients with benign uterine disease underwent robotic NOTES hysterectomy at Eulji University Hospital between February 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS Due to the presence of pelvic adhesions, one of these patients underwent hybrid robotic NOTES hysterectomy with the assistance of isobaric single port laparoscopy; however, there was no conversion to another hysterectomy type such as conventional laparoscopy, laparotomy, or traditional multiport robotic surgery. Median uterine weight was 290 g (range 115-892 g). Median docking and console times were 15 min (range 5-25 min) and 135 min (range 92-215 min), respectively. Mean change in hemoglobin on the first postoperative day was 0.67 Â± 0.7 g/dL. Median EBL was 50 mL (20-450 mL). Median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (3-4 days). No patients experienced postoperative complications such as damage to adjacent organs, re-operation, or vaginal cuff hematoma. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that robotic NOTES hysterectomy is a feasible and safe scarless and gasless surgical technique. It is an effective, minimally invasive vaginal access alternate to NOTES-assisted vaginal hysterectomy or conventional robotic laparoendoscopic single-site surgery hysterectomy in the surgical management of benign uterine disease. Nevertheless, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine its full clinical application.

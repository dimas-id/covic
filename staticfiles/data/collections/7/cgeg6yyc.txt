OBJECTIVE: To identify characteristics of neonatal transport in California and which factors influence team performance. STUDY DESIGN: We led focus group discussions with 19 transport teams operating in California, interviewing 158 neonatal transport team members. Transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULT: The composition of transport teams varied widely. There was strong thematic resonance to suggest that the nature of emergent neonatal transports is unpredictable and poses several significant challenges including staffing, ambulance availability, and administrative support. Teams reported dealing with this unpredictability by engaging in teamwork, gathering experience with staff at referral hospitals, planning for a wide variety of circumstances, specialized training, debriefing after events, and implementing quality improvement strategies. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest potential opportunities for improvement in neonatal transport. Future research can explore the cost and benefits of strategies such as dedicated transport services, transfer centers, and telemedicine.

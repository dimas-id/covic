A drone based on four rotors is considered in this research paper. Its chaotic solution is shown bounded in an inscribed sphere whose vertices are tangent to faces of octahedron. Based on concept of constrained optimization; Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) satisfying quadratic constraint increment multiplier matrix Ïƒ(m), state observers and descriptors with estimated parameter is calculated. Moreover, an image file is decrypted by designing description for mentioned chaotic system and then encrypted on its receiver end. Furthermore, an electric circuit is designed for chaotic quadrotor using LTspice and is fitted into wireless flying robot to observe its dynamics in bounded rectangular region.

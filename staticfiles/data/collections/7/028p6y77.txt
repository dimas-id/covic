Laparoscopic surgery is increasingly being applied to gastric cancer surgery, including proximal gastrectomy for the resection of cancer located in the upper gastric body. Despite the ease of use of stapling devices for end-to-end anastomosis, esophagogastric anastomosis is complicated by the narrow laparoscopic space, making the placement of an esophageal purse-string suture and anvil insertion into the fragile and contracted esophagus difficult. The aim of this study was to employ a novel esophagogastric anastomosis technique for laparoscopic surgery which may avoid esophageal breakdown. Eleven patients with early gastric cancer within the upper gastric body underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy. The anvil of the stapler was introduced into the esophagus through a small gastrostomy, before transection of the esophagus. The esophageal-to-anterior gastric wall anastomosis was performed using a double-stapling technique, without the need to apply a purse-string suture. The mean operation time was 237 +/- 15 min and estimated blood loss was 39 +/- 21 ml. The postoperative course was uneventful in all 11 patients, with no anastomotic leakage observed. Two patients needed endoscopic balloon dilation of an anastomotic stricture 24 to 28 days postoperatively. This modified procedure of laparoscopic esophagogastric anastomosis after proximal gastrectomy for the resection of cancer is a simple, rapid, and atraumatic technique which reduces the risk of anastomotic insufficiency.

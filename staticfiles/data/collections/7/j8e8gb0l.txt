Abstract Severe corona virus disease 19 (Covid-19) is known to be associated with exaggerated risk of thromboembolism. However, the risk associated with mild and moderate illness from Covid-19 is unknown, and there is no current recommendation for prophylaxis against thromboembolism in patients after hospital treatment unless there are established thrombophilic risk factors. We report the case of a 52-year old woman, who presented with massive saddle pulmonary embolism after one week of initial hospital discharge, successfully thrombolysed that raises the question of consideration of extended prophylactic anticoagulation even in low risk Covid-19 cases.

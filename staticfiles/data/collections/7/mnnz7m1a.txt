Although transfusion therapy in the past 30 years has achieved high levels of safety, severe adverse reactions can still complicate a red blood cell, plasma, or platelet transfusion. Adverse events can be either of infectious nature (Infectious Adverse Reactions to Transfusionâ€“IARTs) or noninfectious (NIARTs). The former are due to viruses, bacteria, or protozoa present in the transfused component. Medical doctors faced with an infectious disease in a hospitalized patient should always collect an accurate clinical history that must include transfusion of blood components and take into consideration that the viral/bacterial/protozoan infection could be related to a transfusion event. If a transfusion-transmitted infection is suspected, the clinician must contact the transfusion center that will provide a look-back of the blood products and a follow-up of the involved donors. NIARTs may be of immunological and nonimmunological nature. This chapter provides an overview of pathogenesis, presentation, therapy, and prevention of the main NIARTs. Finally, organizational measures for the management of NIARTs are presented, in order to ensure the highest possible level of safety for the patients.

Greening of Data Centers could be achieved through energy savings in two significant areas, namely: compute systems and cooling systems. A reliable cooling system is necessary to produce a persistent flow of cold air to cool the servers due to increasing computational load demand. Servers’ dissipated heat effects a strain on the cooling systems. Consequently, it is necessary to identify hotspots that frequently occur in the server zones. This is facilitated through the application of data mining techniques to an available big dataset for thermal characteristics of High-Performance Computing ENEA Data Center, namely Cresco 6. This work presents an algorithm that clusters hotspots with the goal of reducing a data centre’s large thermal-gradient due to uneven distribution of server dissipated waste heat followed by increasing cooling effectiveness.

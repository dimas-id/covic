Abstract An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) has been developed to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) in gut associated lymphoid tissues (duodenum and ileum lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes) and systemic locations (spleen and blood) of conventional pigs so as to characterise the mucosal and systemic antibody response generated by the infection with PEDV. A total number of 28 eleven-day-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with the field isolate of the PEDV strain CV-777. Diarrhea was observed in 32% of the pigs and virus shedding was demonstrated in 100% between postinoculation day (PID) 1 and 8. Serum IgG and IgA antibodies to PEDV were detected by isotype ELISA from PID 12 and 15, respectively, reaching maximum values at PID 32 (IgG) and 21 (IgA). PEDV specific IgM ASC occurred in all the tissues between PID 4 and 7, with the strongest response in the intestinal lamina propria. IgA and IgG ASC responses were evident in the intestinal lymphoid tissues from PID 21, the highest number of specific ASC corresponded to the duodenum lamina propria. In the systemic lymphoid tissues the number of IgG and IgA ASC detected were lower than in the mucosal tissues, however, in the blood, presence of IgA ASC was constantly detected from PID 14 until the end of the experiment. Memory antibody response to the PEDV was also studied by secondary in vitro stimulation of the mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood. The memory B cell response was prominent at PID 21 and 25 and consisted in IgG and IgA ASC. To our knowledge, this is the first report to research into the presence and distribution of specific ASC in different locations of the systemic and the gut associated lymphoid tissues after a PEDV infection as well as the presence of memory B cells.

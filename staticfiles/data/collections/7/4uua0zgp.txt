The purpose of this study was to detect changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis of post-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Chinese patients with osteonecrosis, investigate the aetiology of post-SARS osteonecrosis (ON), and select the sensitive molecular markers for identifying the susceptible population. For this study, blood samples were collected from 88 patients with post-SARS ON and 52 healthy people. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), protein C (PC), antithrombin III (AT–III), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), activated protein C resistance (APC–R), plasminogen (PLG), von Willebrand’s factor(vWF), D–dimer (D–D), fibrinogen (Fib), and homocysteine (HCY) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We noted that blood agents of patients with ON changed obviously. APTT, PC, AT–III, PAI, APC–R, and PLG were significantly different between the two groups. Hypercoagulation and hypofibrinolysis were found in patients with post-SARS ON. Therefore, these examinations can be used to screen a population susceptible to ON. Measurements of APTT, PC, AT–III, PAI, APC–R, and PLG are sensitive blood tests for screening purposes.

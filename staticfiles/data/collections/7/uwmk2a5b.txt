Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and has resulted in more than four million cases globally and the death cases exceeded 300,000. Normally, a range of surviving and propagating host factors must be employed for the completion of the infectious process including RPs. Viral protein biosynthesis involves the interaction of numerous RPs with viral mRNA, proteins which are necessary for viruses replication regulation and infection inside the host cells. Most of these interactions are crucial for virus activation and accumulation. However, only small percentage of these proteins is specifically responsible for host cells protection by triggering the immune pathway against virus. This research proposes RPs extracted from bacillus sp. and yeast as new forum for the advancement of antiviral therapy. Hitherto, antiviral therapy with RPs-involving viral infection has not been widely investigated as critical targets. Also, exploring antiviral strategy based on RPs could be a promising guide for more potential therapeutics.

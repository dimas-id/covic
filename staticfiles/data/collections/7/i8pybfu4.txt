Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the coronavirus strain that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization has designated the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. During the pandemic and lockdown period, many dermatological clinics were temporarily closed in Turkey as well as all over the world. Taking the necessary precautions, the hospital continued to examine all emergent and elective patients who applied to our dermatology clinic. We investigated the most common reasons for admission of pediatric and adult patients who were admitted to our outpatient clinic between 30 March and 30 April 2020, the period with the highest number of COVID-19 patients in Turkey. In children and adult age groups, the most common reason for admission was acne ([N: 10, 16.4%] and [N: 89, 20.9%], respectively). Of the 99 acne patients, 70 (70.7%) were using systemic isotretinoin and applied to our clinic to repeat the prescription or continue the agent. The number of pediatric patients admitted to the dermatology department drastically reduced during the lockdown period, which was attributed to the curfew for children in the country.

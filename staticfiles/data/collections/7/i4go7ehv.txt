Toona sinensis (TS) is one of the most popular vegetarian dishes in Taiwan. It has been shown to exhibit antioxidant, antiangiogenic, antiatherosclerotic, and anticancer properties. In this study, we demonstrated the ability of aqueous leaf extracts from TS to promote immune responses in BALB/c mice and to exhibit anti-leukemia activity in murine WEHI-3 cells. BALB/c mice were injected intravenously with WEHI-3 cells and then treated orally with TS (50 mg/kg). In vivo study showed that TS treatment reduced liver and spleen enlargement in WEHI-3 bearing mice compared with the untreated group. Furthermore, TS also decreased white blood cells (WBC), indicating inhibition of differentiation of the precursor of macrophages in WEHI-3 bearing mice. Treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS (0-75 μg/mL for 24 hours) significantly reduced cell viability. Furthermore, TS treatment–induced late apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin-V/PI staining. Western blot analyses revealed that treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS statistically increased the protein expression level of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm and activates caspase-3. Notably, TS treatment caused a dramatic reduction in Bcl-2 and increase in Bax protein levels. TS may disturb the Bcl-2 and Bax protein ratio and induce apoptosis. This reports confirms the antitumor activity of this nutritious vegetable potentially against leukemia.

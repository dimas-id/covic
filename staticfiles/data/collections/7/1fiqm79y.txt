Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infection of piglets results in a very rapid and massive release of IFN-alpha in serum and secretions. The objective of this work was to characterize the IFN-alpha-producing cells (IPC) in tissues of TGEV-infected piglets. Caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets were infected orally with the TGEV virulent Miller strain and IPC were characterized in situ by immunohistochemistry, using a rabbit anti-pig IFN-alpha antiserum. IPC were almost exclusively detected in intestinal tissues and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), as early as 6 h post inoculation (p.i.), with a peak at 12-18 h. They disappeared by 24 h. IPC were localized between enterocytes in the small intestine epithelial layer, in the lamina propria, around the Peyer's patches and, at highest frequency, in MLN. Very few IPC were present in the spleen and popliteal lymph nodes of infected piglets. Double immunohistochemical staining for IFN-alpha and leukocyte markers on MLN cryosections showed that IPC were mainly Swine Leukocyte Antigen (SLA) class II positive, and were not stained by an anti-macrophage (SWC3a) MAb. In addition, double staining with anti-TGEV and anti-IFN-alpha MAbs showed that viral antigens were present in MLN, close to IPC. These results show for the first time the presence of IPC in gut mucosa and gut-associated lymphoid tissues in response to an enteropathogenic virus. Moreover, this work shows that IFN-alpha released in serum is likely to originate almost exclusively from gut IPC triggered locally by viral antigens to produce IFN-alpha, since there were very few IPC in spleen or peripheral lymph nodes. MHC class II molecule expression by gut-associated IPC suggests that these cells may be the in vivo mucosal counterparts of the dendritic cells recently shown to produce IFN-alpha after in vitro viral induction.

BACKGROUND: Little empirical evidence is known about the sleep quality of frontline health professionals working in isolation units or hospitals during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in China. This study thus aimed to examine the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its demographic and correlates among frontline health professionals. METHODS: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional survey conducted in Liaoning province, China. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: A total of 1,931 frontline health professionals were recruited. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 18.4% (95%CI: 16.6%–20.11%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that older age (OR=1.043, 95%CI=1.026–1.061, P < 0.001), being nurse (OR=3.132, 95%CI=1.727–5.681, P < 0.001), and working in outer emergency medical team (OR=1.755, 95%CI=1.029–3.064, P=0.039) were positively associated with poor sleep quality. Participants who were familiar with crisis response knowledge were negatively associated with poor sleep quality (OR=0.70, 95%CI=0.516–0.949, P=0.021). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of poor sleep quality was relatively low among frontline health professionals during the COVID-19 epidemic. Considering the negative impact of poor sleep quality on health professionals’ health outcomes and patient outcomes, regularly screening and timely treatments are warranted to reduce the likelihood of poor sleep quality in health professionals.

The previous chapter 7 represented the first research part of this thesis. It captured the current state of scenario planning practices in the logistics service industry from an internal and an external perspective. It revealed, in line with the literature review, a backward picture of such planning practices compared to industry sector standard and overall. The need for an exemplary industry focused scenario study in the logistics environment was particularly worked out in the chapters 5.3 (literature review) and 7.3 (conclusion of triangulation research). This chapter 8 presents the research results of research phase II and therefore addresses the identified research gap.

Summary The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 represents a special risk for renal patients due to their comorbidities and advanced age. The usual performance of hemodialysis treatment s in collective rooms increases the risk. The specific information at this time in this regard is very limited. This manuscript includes a proposal for action to prevent infection in the N ephrology S ervices, and in particular in H emodialysis U nits, with the objective of early identification of patients who meet the definition of a suspected case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 and propose circuits and mechanisms to carry out hemodialysis treatment s. They are recommendations in continuous review and can be modified if the epidemiological situation, the diagnostic and therapeutic options so require.

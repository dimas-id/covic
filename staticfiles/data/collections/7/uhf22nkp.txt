It was discovered early, that in order to achieve the desired QoS properties a design methodology for real-time systems has to include appropriate measures to ensure that the QoS criteria are considered during the entire life-cycle. These have been joined in the framework of the ISO/IEC 13236 [31] and ISO/IEC TR 13243 [32] standards for QoS in information technology, and the standard IEC 61508 [28], which includes the necessary activities for safety-related systems from a projectâ€™s start until the end of its life-cycle. Like safety, security is also an issue that is gaining importance for embedded (real-time) applications [76], and which must be dealt with during the design phase, too.

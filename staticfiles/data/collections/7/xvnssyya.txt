H‐bonding, as a non covalent stabilizing interaction of diverse nature, has a central role in the structure, function and dynamics of chemical and biological processes, pivotal to molecular recognition and eventually to drug design. Types of conventional and non conventional (H−H, dihydrogen, H‐ π, CH‐ π, anti‐ , proton coordination and H−S) H‐bonding interactions are discussed as well as features emerging from their interplay, such as cooperativity (σ‐ and π‐) effects and allostery. Its utility in many applications is described. Catalysis, proton and electron transfer processes in various materials or supramolecular architectures of preorganized hosts for guest binding, are front‐line technology. The H‐bond–related concept of proton transfer (PT) addresses energy issues or deciphering the mechanism of many natural and synthetic processes. PT is also of paramount importance in the functions of cells and is assisted by large complex proteins embedded in membranes. Both intermolecular and intramolecular PT in H‐bonded systems has received attention, theoretically and experimentally, using prototype molecules. It is found in rearrangement reactions, protein functions, and enzyme reactions or across proton channels and pumps. Investigations on the competition between intra‐ and intermolecular H bonding are discussed. Of particular interest is the H‐bond furcation, a common phenomenon in protein‐ligand binding. Multiple H‐bonding (H‐bond furcation) is observed in supramolecular structures.

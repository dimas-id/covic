Antibacterial activities of novel organoarsenic compounds As(III)-containing Schiff bases on Escherichia coli (CCTCCAB91112) were investigated by microcalorimetry in this study. The experimental result showed that the arsenic(III)-containing Schiff bases at micromolar concentration exhibit strong inhibition on the E. coli. Specifically, the growth rate constant k decreased, and the generation time t G and the inhibitory ratio I (percentage) increased with the increased dose of the arsenicals as inhibitors. All of the arsenicals display the feature of considerable lag phase inhibition on the cell growth. The compound 4-(4-bromobenzaliminyl)phenylarsenoxide makes the lag phase of E. coli cell growth cycles to reach 650 min at 5 μmol/L. The compounds with donating electron groups at aromatic ring B have lower IC50 to present higher antibacterial activity. The compound 4-(4-hydroxyl-3-methoxylbenzaliminyl)phenylarsenoxide has the lowest IC50 (1.82 μmol/L) to show the strongest antibacterial activity among them.

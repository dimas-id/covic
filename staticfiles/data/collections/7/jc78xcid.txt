Data on the genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii causing Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) among children are still limited, and there are no available data from the Indian subcontinent, particularly associations between genotypes and clinical characteristics. A total of 37 children (62 days-12 years [median 5.5 years]) were included in this study. Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T > C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe PCP and treatment failure. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 13 unique sequence types (STs). Two STs (i) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96/98 â€“ PJ1 and (ii) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96- PJ3 were significantly associated with treatment failure and high mortality among PCP-positive patients. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests the emergence of virulent P. jirovecii strains or genetic polymorphisms, leading to treatment failure and high mortality. Our study is the first of its kind from the Indian subcontinent and has highlighted the genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii among children and their clinical outcomes. These findings emphasize the need to focus more on genotypes to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia.

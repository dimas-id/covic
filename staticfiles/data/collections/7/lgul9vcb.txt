At the April 1992, mid-term meeting of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) a proposal from the Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) to include the torovirus genus in the Coronaviridae was accepted. Following another proposal, the arterivirus genus was removed from the Togaviridae but not assigned to another family. The arteriviruses have some features in common with the Coronaviridae but also have major differences. After much debate, culminating in September 1992, it was decided that the CSG would not recommend inclusion of arterivirus in the Coronaviridae. It was agreed that (a) the nomenclature used for coronavirus genes, mRNAs and polypeptides (Cavanagh et al., 1990) should be used for toroviruses, (b) that the small (about 100 amino acids) membrane-associated protein, which is distinct from the integral membrane glycoprotein M, associated with virions of infectious bronchitis (Liu & Inglis, 1991) and transmissible gastroenteritis (Godet et al., 1992) coronaviruses would be referred to by the acronym sM (lower case 's') and (c) that 'pol' (polymerase) should be used as a working term for gene 1, which comprises open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b in both genera of the Coronaviridae.

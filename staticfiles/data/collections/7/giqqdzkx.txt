the biosensor based on imaging ellipsometry for bio-molecular interactions has been developed for more than ten years and used to several biological applications successfully, such as detection of five markers of Hepatitis B, tumor markers and virus infection. Ligand surface concentration which might be related with its spatial configuration and bioactivity is an important factor to affect the biosensor sensitivity and dynamic range. In this investigation, IgG and its corresponding antibody are selected as a couple of model molecules for the optimization of ligand surface concentration. The optimization result of ligand surface concentration is achieved by analyzing the surface concentration increase of antigenantibody complex on sensing surface with various ligand surface concentrations.

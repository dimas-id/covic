This chapter illustrates a life story, intellectually and emotionally. Anecdotal evidence from my own experience shows the interconnected influence that the four dimensions of human experience (aspiration, emotion, thought, and sensation) have on each other, on our personal wellbeing, and on others. Following the storyline through the next pages you will be guided to gradually notice the connection between your own experiences and this framework; four interconnected principles operated in them: Connection—Everything is linked. Nothing exists in a vacuum. Change—Everything evolves, constantly. Continuum—Everything is connected in a seamless flow. Complementarity—Everything exists in relation to something else, that may be its opposite and the counterpart that makes it complete.

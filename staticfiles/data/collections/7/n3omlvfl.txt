The nucleolus is a multifunctional compartment of the eukaryotic nucleus. Besides its well-recognised role in transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA and the assembly of ribosomal subunits, the nucleolus has functions in the processing and assembly of a variety of RNPs and is involved in cell cycle control and senescence and as a sensor of stress. Historically, nucleoli have been tenuously linked to the biogenesis and, in particular, export of mRNAs in yeast and mammalian cells. Recently, data from plants have extended the functions in which the plant nucleolus is involved to include transcriptional gene silencing as well as mRNA surveillance and nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA export. The nucleolus in plants may therefore have important roles in the biogenesis and quality control of mRNAs.

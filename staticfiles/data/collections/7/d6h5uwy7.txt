Abstract This paper investigates how the change in nanomaterial (NM) shape influences resistance evolution during conformal interconnect fabrication via sequential Vacuum-forming and Flash Light Sintering (FLS) approach. The NM shape in the conformal circuit is tuned by mixing nanowires (NW) with nanoflakes (NF) or nanospheres (NS) at different mixing ratios. The change in line resistance post-forming and post-sintering for any given mixing ratio is studied in greater depth using SEM characterization, UV-Vis spectrophotometry and thermal measurements. For optimal NM mixing ratio and process parameters, the fabricated circuit achieves electrical resistivity of 55.4 µΩ-cm within 30 seconds on a wall inclined at 60⁰ to the horizontal with a width to height aspect ratio of 2.5:1.

Background Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is the cause of a pandemic disease, with severe acute respiratory syndrome by binding target epithelial lung cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in humans. Thus, hypertensive patients with COVID-19 could have worse prognosis. Indeed, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEi) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may interfere with ACE2 expression/activity. Thus, hypertensive patients undergoing ACEi and/or ARBs drug therapy may be at a higher risk of contracting a serious COVID-19 infection and should be monitored. Moreover, in the present study we investigated the effects of ACEi vs. ARBs vs. calcium channel blockers on clinical outcomes as mechanical ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, heart injury and death in 62 hypertensive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. Methods and Results The multicenter study was prospectively conducted at Department of Infectious Diseases of Sant'Anna Hospital of Caserta, and of University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli" of Naples, at Department of Advanced Surgical and Medical Sciences of University of Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli", Naples, and at General Medical Assistance Unit "FIMG", Naples, Italy. Lowest values of left ventricle ejection fraction predicted deaths (1.142; [1.008-1.294], p <0.05), while highest values of interleukin 6 (IL6) predicted the admission to ICU (1.617; [1.094-2.389]), mechanical ventilation (1.149; [1.082-1.219]), heart injuries (1.367; [1.054-1.772]) and deaths (4.742; [1.788-8.524]). ConclusionsAnti-hypertensive drugs didn't affect the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Consequently, tailored anti-inflammatory and immune therapies in addition to chronic antihypertensive therapy, could prevent a worse prognosis, as well as improve the clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 infection.

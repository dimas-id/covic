BACKGROUND The aim of this paper was to explore disparities associated with the route of hysterectomy in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) health system and to evaluate whether the hysterectomy clinical pathway implementation impacted disparities in the utilization of minimally invasive hysterectomy (MIH). METHODS We performed a retrospective medical record review of all the patients who have undergone hysterectomy for benign indications at UPMC-affiliated hospitals between fiscal years (FY) 2012 and 2014. RESULTS A total number of 6373 hysterectomy patient cases were included in this study: 88.7% (5653) were European American (EA), 11.02% (702) were African American (AA), and the remaining 0.28% (18) were of other ethnicities. We found that non-EA, women aged 45-60, traditional Medicaid, and traditional Medicare enrollees were more likely to have a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Residence in higher median income zip code (> $61,000) was associated with 60% lower odds of undergoing TAH. Both FY 2013 and 2014 were associated with significantly lower odds of TAH. Logistic regression results from the model for non-EA patients for FY 2012 and FY 2014 demonstrated that FY and zip code income group were not significant predictors of surgery type in this subgroup. Pathway implementation did not reduce racial disparity in MIH utilization. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that there is a significant disparity in MIH utilization, where non-EA and Medicaid/Medicare recipients had higher odds of undergoing TAH. Further research is needed to investigate how care standardization may alleviate healthcare disparities.

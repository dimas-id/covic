Community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) are frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in tranplant recipients. In most series, respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza are the most common CARVs, followed by influenza and adenovirus. Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with these infections, particularly when they progress to pneumonia or when they are associated with bacterial or fungal coinfections. Outcomes are also poor with adenovirus, frequently reflecting disseminated infection. Efforts to prevent morbidity and mortality from CARV infection should focus on prevention, because treatment options are limited with inconclusive data to support their efficacy.

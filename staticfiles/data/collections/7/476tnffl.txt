The aim was to evaluate the potential of Spectral Photon-Counting Computed Tomography (SPCCT) to differentiate between liquid embolic agents and iodinated contrast medium by using tantalum-characteristic K-edge imaging. Tubes with a concentration series of tantalum and inserts with different concentrations of iodine were scanned with a preclinical SPCCT system. Tantalum density maps (TDM) and iodine density maps (IDM) were generated from a SPCCT acquisition. Furthermore, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was performed within the tubes in the conventional CT, the TDM and IDM. TDM and IDM enable clear differentiation between both substances. Quantitative measurements of different tantalum concentrations match well with those of actually diluted mixtures. SPCCT allows for differentiation between tantalum and iodine and may enable for an improved follow-up diagnosis in patients after vascular occlusion therapy.

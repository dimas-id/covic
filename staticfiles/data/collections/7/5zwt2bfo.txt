OBJECTIVE: Significant healthcare disruption due to pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has implications across all aspects of clinical care in the United States (US). In this study, we aim to assess urology residency program modifications in the context of COVID-19, and perceptions of the impact on urology trainees. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of program leadership and residents at accredited US urology residencies was administered between April 28, 2020 â€“ March 11, 2020. Total cohort responses are reported, and sub-analyses were preformed comparing responses between those in in high vs low COVID-19 geographic regions, and between program leaders vs residents. RESULTS: Program leaders from 43% of programs and residents from 18% of programs responded. Respondents reported decreased surgical volume (83%-100% varying by subspecialty), increased use of telehealth (99%), a transition to virtual educational platforms (95%) and decreased size of inpatient resident teams (90%). Most residents are participating in care of COVID-19 patients (83%) and 20% endorsed that urology residents have been re-deployed. 79% of respondents perceive a negative impact of recent events on urology surgery training and anxiety regarding competency upon completion of residency training was more pronounced among respondents in high COVID-19 regions. CONCLUSION: Major modifications to urology training programs were implemented in response to COVID-19. Attention must be paid to the downstream effects of the training disruption on urology residents.

Cities are important barriers to protect peopleâ€™s lives and property in the face of natural disasters, economic fluctuations and epidemic diseases. The evaluation of urban resilience is a hybrid multiple attribute group decision-making problem involving both crisp and fuzzy indicators. In order to evaluate the urban resilience reasonably and quantitatively, an urban resilience evaluation index system is established, including four primary indicators of ecological environment, municipal facilities, economic development and social development, and 28 secondary indicators. An evaluation model based on the theory of intuitionistic fuzzy set and TOPSIS method is proposed. The intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number is used to quantify the fuzzy index and determine the weights of experts. The weight of each index is determined based on the maximizing deviation method. The relevant data of Dalian City from 2013 to 2017 are collected to evaluate the city resilience, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out based on the proposed model. The results may provide insights for the further urban resilience promotion.

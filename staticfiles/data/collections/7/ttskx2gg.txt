The study of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus revealed the close association of the disease with measlesâ€”or a related virus. High titres of antibodies to measles virus were found in patients that correlated with the course of the disease. Immunofluorescence tests revealed measles virus or a related antigen in lupus-affected tissues. Inclusion bodies consisting of paramyxovirus-like ribonucleoprotein structures were regularly detected in both affected tissues and leukocytes. Molecular hybridization of measles virus RNA with DNA from the affected tissues showed that DNA transcripts of measles or a closely related virus are integrated in the cellular nuclear DNA. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease are discussed.

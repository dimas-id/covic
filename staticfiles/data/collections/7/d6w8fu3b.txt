Pandemics have threatened human race many a times. One of the most important tasks during a pandemic is to bring awareness among people. Bringing awareness contributes a lot in controlling any pandemic. Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and the level of severity of this disease, it is extremely important to make people aware of various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing, that are to be followed to prevent the disease and break the chain of spread. This mode of educating individuals about the disease is being widely carried out as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations in the present day spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few mobile applications or games, aimed to bring awareness about a pandemic, which is much lesser in case of Covid-19. Also, considering the lockdown scenario across the world, games also act as a good pass time indoors. Hence, we propose a 2D survival based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes, by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android based mobile game and has been evaluated through a remote qualitative user survey, with 20 volunteers. The results of the survey are promising with all the questions of survey having mean value greater than 3.6.

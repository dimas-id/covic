Abstract Faeces samples from 218, 1 to 30-day-old, diarrheic dairy calves in 65 dairy herds were screened for the presence of Cryptosporidium and concurrent infections with rotavirus, coronavirus, F5+ Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. Calves were grouped according to their age as follows: 1–7, 8–14, 15–21 and 22–30 days. Cryptosporidium infection was detected in 43.8%, 71.9%, 63.2% and 6.9% of the calves in the respective age groups. Significant differences in the detection rate of Cryptosporidium were found between the age group 22–30 days and all other age groups, and between the age group 1–7 days and the age groups 8–14 days and 15–21 days. Cryptosporidium was the only enteropathogen detected in 60 of the 114 (52.6%) diarrheic calves. Concurrent infections with other enteropathogen(s) were detected in 64.3%, 46.3%, 39.5% and 0% of the Cryptosporidium-infected calves in the age groups 1–7, 8–14, 15–21 and 22–30 days, respectively. A significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections (p <0.05) was found. The detection rates of the other enteropathogens considered in calves with Cryptosporidium infection were 87% for rotavirus, 11.1% for coronavirus, 27.8% for F5+ E. coli and 1.8% for Salmonella.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) live vaccines are supplied in lyophilized form and usually administered through conventional routes (drinking water, spray, or eye drop) following reconstitution in a diluent. Virus inactivation due to physico-chemical properties of the diluent at the time of administration may lead to vaccine failure. The present study aimed to evaluate the survival of NDV live vaccine strain immersed in 5 pH-amended water samples (pH 5.00, pH 6.00, pH 7.00, pH 8.00, and pH 9.00) by sequential determination of virus infectivity on Vero cells for 3 hours. Minimum reduction in virus infectivity was recorded in the water with neutral or slightly alkaline pH, while the virus was relatively less stable at extreme pH conditions. Maximum reduction of infectivity was observed in the water with pH 9.00 in which the virus was completely inactivated within 3 hours. Addition of stabilizers (Cevamune(®) or skimmed milk) slightly altered the pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the virus-charged water samples. In the stabilizer-added water samples, minimum reduction in infectivity was observed in the water with neutral pH, followed by the ones with a pH of 8.00, 6.00, 5.00, and 9.00. In all types of water samples, T-90 values (time required for 90% reduction in virus infectivity) were highest (485 minutes) at neutral pH (pH 7.00) and lowest (102 to 134 min) at an extreme alkaline condition (pH 9.00). Results of the present study indicate that water with a pH range of 7.00 to 8.00 is suitable for administration of NDV live vaccines. However, the addition of Cevamune(®) or skimmed milk may have beneficial effects on preserving the infectivity of the virus, even at extreme pH conditions.

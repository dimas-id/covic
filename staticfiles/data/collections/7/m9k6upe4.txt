A novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we performed a comprehensive epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from ten patients in Shaoxing, a mid-sized city outside of the epicenter Hubei province, China, during the early stage of the outbreak (late January to early February, 2020). We obtained viral genomes with > 99% coverage and a mean depth of 296X demonstrating that viral genomic analysis is feasible via metagenomics sequencing directly on nasopharyngeal samples with SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Ct values less than 28. We found that a cluster of 4 patients with travel history to Hubei shared the exact same virus with patients from Wuhan, Taiwan, Belgium and Australia, highlighting how quickly this virus spread to the globe. The virus from another cluster of husband and wife without travel history but with a sick contact of a confirmed case from another city outside of Hubei accumulated significantly more mutations (9 SNPs vs average 4 SNPs), suggesting a complex and dynamic nature of this outbreak. We also found 70% patients in this study had the S genotype, consistent with an early study showing a higher prevalence of S genotype out of Hubei than that inside Hubei. We calculated an average mutation rate of 1.37x10-3 nucleotide substitution per site per year, which is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Our findings add to the growing knowledge of the epidemiological and genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 that are important for guiding outbreak containment and vaccine development. The moderate mutation rate of this virus also lends hope that development of an effective, long-lasting vaccine may be possible.

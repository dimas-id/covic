MERS-CoV is the sixth type of corona virus to cause disease in humans. This virus can cause severe respiratory infections, particularly in patients with underlying conditions. Although dromedary camels appear to be the most important source in primary cases, nosocomial transmission has proved to be a major cause of secondary infections. In accordance with the case definitions formulated by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), in those patients who present with lower respiratory infections within 14 days of visiting the Arabian Peninsula, MERS-CoV should be considered.

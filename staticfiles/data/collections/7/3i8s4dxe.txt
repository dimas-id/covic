BACKGROUND: Cough is one of common symptoms of influenza, the cough duration and prevalence of postinfectious cough (PIC) after viral upper respiratory tract infection has not been well described. OBJECTIVES: We aim to investigate the duration of cough and prevalence of PIC and its relation with acute symptoms, airway inflammation and cough sensitivity in patients with H1N1 influenza. METHODS: Patients with acute symptoms of H1N1 influenza were enrolled and followed up until cough relived. Spirometry, induced sputum test, capsaicin challenge test were conducted in patients with PIC. Cough sensitivity was presented as logarithm of provocative concentration inducing five or more coughs (logC5). RESULTS: A total of 141 cases with H1N1 influenza were enrolled. In patients with H1N1 influenza, 97.2% of them complained cough. The duration of cough was as following: <1 week (73.0%); 1–2 weeks (7.8%); 2–3 weeks (7.8%); ≥3 weeks (8.5%). Twelve (8.5%) patients had cough lasting more than 3 weeks (PIC), 4 (2.8%) patients developed chronic cough (>8 weeks). Acute symptoms, spirometry, bronchial responsiveness and sputum differential cell count were similar between patients with PIC and those without PIC, however, there was a higher prevalence of previous PIC (58.3% vs 14.7%, P < 0.05) and elevated cough sensitivity (lgC5: 1.18 ± 0.58 vs 2.73 ± 0.33, P < 0.01) in patients with PIC as compared with the patients without PIC. CONCLUSIONS: Acute cough is common in patients with H1N1 PIC, only a few of patients develop chronic cough. Acute symptoms cannot predict PIC which is related with previous PIC and increased cough sensitivity.

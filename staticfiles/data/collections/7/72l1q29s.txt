OBJECTIVE We evaluated efficacy of combining proximal balloon guiding catheter (antegrade flow arrest) and distal access catheter (aspiration at the site of occlusion) in thrombectomy for anterior circulation ischemic stroke. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 116 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever. The patients were divided by the techniques adopted, the combined technique (proximal balloon guiding catheter and large bore distal access catheter) group (n=57, 49.1%) and the conventional (guiding catheter with stent retriever) technique group (n=59, 50.9%). We evaluated baseline characteristics (epidemiologic data, clinical and imaging characteristics) and procedure details (the number of retrieval attempts, procedure time), as well as angiographic (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score, distal thrombus migration) and clinical outcome (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at discharge, modified Rankin Scale [mRS] at 3 months) of them. RESULTS The number of retrieval attempts was lower (p=0.002) and the first-pass successful reperfusion rate was higher (56.1% vs. 28.8%; p=0.003) in the combined technique group. And the rate of final result of TICI score 3 was higher (68.4% vs. 28.8%; p<0.01) and distal thrombus migration rate was also lower (15.8% vs. 40.7%; p=0.021) in the combined technique group. Early strong neurologic improvement (improvement of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≥11 or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ≤1 at discharge) rate (57.9% vs. 36.2%; p=0.02) and favorable clinical outcome (mRS at 3 months ≤2) rate (59.6% vs. 33.9%; p=0.005) were also better in the combined technique group. CONCLUSION The combined technique needs lesser attempts, decreases distal migration, increases TICI 3 reperfusion and achieves better clinical outcomes.

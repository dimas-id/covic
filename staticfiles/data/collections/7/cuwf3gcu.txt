Neurologists are interested in understanding whether patients with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) undergoing immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapy are more susceptible to developing COVID-19 or have worse outcomes. Currently, there are no conclusive data in this regard. We report the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 (confirmed and possible) in pwMS followed at the Veneto Regional MS Center in Verona (Italy), an area most stricken by COVID-19. In our sample size, the prevalence of COVID-19 seems to be much higher than that officially reported at the regional level on the general population, but it also characterized by a favourable course.

Abstract The potential for spread of COVID-19 infections in Skilled Nursing Facilities and other Long-Term Care sites poses new challenges for Nursing Home Administrators to protect patients and staff. It is anticipated that as Acute Care Hospitals reach capacity, Nursing Homes may retain COVID-19 infected residents longer prior to transferring to an Acute Care Hospital. This article outlines 5 pragmatic steps that Long-Term Care facilities can take to manage airflow within resident rooms to reduce the potential for spread of infectious airborne droplets into surrounding areas including hallways and adjacent rooms, using strategies adapted from negative pressure isolation rooms in acute care facilities.

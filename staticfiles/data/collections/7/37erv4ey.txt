Rapidly evolving RNA viruses continuously produce viral minority variants following infection that can quickly spread and become dominant variants if they are drug-resistant or can better evade the immune system. Early detection of minority viral variants may help to promptly change a patientâ€™s treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies used for viral testing have recently gained popularity in commercial pipelines and can efficiently identify minority variants. Unfortunately, NGS data require nontrivial computational analyses to eliminate sequencing noise and current computational haplotyping methods do not adequately address this challenging task. To overcome this limitation, we developed CliqueSNV, which finds statistically linked mutations from the same haplotypes to detect minor mutations with an abundance below the sequencing error rates. We compared the performance of CliqueSNV with five state-of-the-art methods with six benchmarks, including three Illumina and one PacBio in vitro sequencing datasets.We show that CliqueSNV can assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1%. CliqueSNV haplotype predictions were the closest to the experimental viral populations and showed up to a 2.94-fold improvement on Illumina data and a 19.3-fold improvement on PacBio data.

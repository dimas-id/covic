We report a rare complication in an immunosuppressed patient with IgA nephropathy who suffered from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe capillary leakage and shock after placement of a double lumen central venous catheter. He could be successfully treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and therapeutic plasma exchange. This report highlights the severity of late-onset complications of catheter placements and shows the potential of ECMO treatment for the management of acute illnesses with bridge to recovery.

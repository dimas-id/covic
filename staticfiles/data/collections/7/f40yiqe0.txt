OBJECTIVE: Although healthcare-associated (HA) viral respiratory infections (VRIs) are common in pediatrics, no benchmark for comparison exists. We aimed to determine, compare, and assess determinants of unit-specific HA-VRI incidence rates in 2 children’s hospitals. METHODS: This study was a retrospective comparison of prospective cohorts. The Montreal Children’s Hospital and the Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York perform prospective surveillance for HA-VRI using standardized definitions that require the presence of symptoms compatible with VRI and virus detection. Cases detected between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2013, were identified using surveillance databases. Annual incidence rates were calculated, and a generalized estimating equation model was used to assess determinants of HA-VRI rates. RESULTS: The overall HA-VRI rate during the 3-year study period was significantly higher at Montreal Children’s Hospital than that at Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York (1.91 vs 0.80 per 1000 patient-days, respectively; P < .0001). Overall, the HA-VRI incidence rate was lowest in the neonatal intensive care unit. Rates in the pediatric intensive care, oncology, and medical/surgical units were similar. The most common etiology of HA-VRI at both institutions was rhinovirus (49% of cases), followed by parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Hospitals with less than 50% single rooms had HA-VRI rates 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.37) times higher than hospitals with more than 50% single rooms for a given unit type. CONCLUSIONS: HA-VRI rates were substantial but different among 2 children’s hospitals. Future studies should examine the effect of HA-VRI and evaluate best practices for preventing such infections.

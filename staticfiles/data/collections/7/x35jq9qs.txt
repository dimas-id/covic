Transmission electron microscopy (of ultrathin sections) was used to examine the biomass of lung tissue in the immunodeficiency minipigs experimentally infected with Pneumocystis carinii. The material was found to contain pneumocysts, bacteria, and coronaviruses. There was a clear coronavirus-pneumocyst structural relationship. The findings suggest the combined effect of microorganisms of different systematic groups on the development of a pathological process in the experimental infection etiologically determined by Pneumocystis carinii.

A 53-year-old man with an Amyand hernia with indirect and direct components was repaired with a Bio-A (Gore, Newark, Delaware) plug and a patch made of Bio-A tissue reinforcement material. The repair of an Amyand hernia addresses the pathology of the appendix as well as the hernia. We report a case in which a plug and patch repair was undertaken using Bio-A implants in a clean-contaminated field with no signs of infection or recurrence in the follow-up period, and we review the literature regarding the diagnosis and repair of an Amyand hernia.

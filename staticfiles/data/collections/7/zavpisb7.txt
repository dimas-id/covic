The final chapter gives recognition to the contribution and achievements of the personal social services and social work during the past 50 years. It also reflects on what has been lost compared to the ambitions and intentions when local authority personal social services were first integrated in England and when social work became a unified profession across the United Kingdom. This chapter looks forward to the threats and opportunities ahead and notes the important contribution that social work and the personal social services can and still need to make.

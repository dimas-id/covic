Myron Cohen has run clinical trials through hurricanes and civil unrest Now, the infectious disease researcher at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, says he and his colleagues are in a new situation: trying to carry out large, international trials in the midst of coronavirus lockdowns Cohen co-leads a network of HIV prevention trials, some of which have paused during the pandemic But for other studies, he says, “stopping would be of grave consequence” to participants So study teams have bought and shipped protective equipment to personnel at clinical trial sites, secured special permits where necessary for trial participants to leave their homes for medical visits, and arranged their private transportation to avoid public buses Not all clinical trials have had to go through such logistical gymnastics But across diverse fields, investigators have managed to keep treating patients who might benefit from experimental therapies Slowdowns and pauses in recruiting new participants will delay results—but for many studies, data are still flowing in

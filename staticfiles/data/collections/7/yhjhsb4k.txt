BACKGROUND The natural history of basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is devastating, with morbidity rates increasing up to 80%. However, the efficacy of recanalization therapy for BAO has not been established as yet. OBJECTIVE We analyzed consecutive cases of BAO treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) to evaluate its safety and efficacy and to determine factors associated with the prognosis. METHODS Between October 2011 and September 2016, MT was performed in 34 patients with BAO. MT was performed using the Penumbra system and stent retriever. CT perfusion was used for evaluating patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps were evaluated. CBF/CBV mismatch was defined as ≥50% penumbra. Clinical outcomes were correlated with demographic, clinical, and radiographic findings. RESULTS The median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 29 (14-33). The recanalization rate (≥thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grades 2b) was 100%. The median onset to recanalization time (OTR) was 197 (160-256) min. Favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) at 90 days occurred in 56% (n = 19 of 34). The mortality rate at 90 days was 12% (n = 4 of 34). In univariate analysis, intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) use, and OTR were significantly associated with favorable outcomes. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IV rt-PA use and lower National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score were significantly related to favorable outcomes. Conclusion and Relevance: Multimodal endovascular therapy using the Penumbra system and stent retriever demonstrated a high recanalization rate and favorable outcomes for BAO. Both devices were feasible and effective in the treatment of BAO. An approach combining MT with IV thrombolysis provided a better recanalization rate and more favorable clinical outcomes.

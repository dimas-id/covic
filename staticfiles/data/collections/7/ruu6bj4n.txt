IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for many hematological malignancies and genetic disorders. The majority of patients do not have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling donor, and alternative stem cell sources include HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donors and haploidentical related donors. However, alternative donor HSCT are associated with three major complications i) graft rejection; ii) graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); and iii) delayed immune reconstitution leading to viral infections and relapse. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Graft rejection and the risk of GvHD can be significantly reduced by using intensive conditioning regimens, including in vivo T cell depletion as well as ex vivo T cell depletion of the graft. However, the benefits of removing alloreactive T cells from the graft are offset by the concomitant removal of T cells with anti-viral or anti-tumor activity as well as the profound delay in endogenous T cell recovery post-transplant. Thus, opportunistic infections, many of which are not amenable to conventional small-molecule therapeutics, are frequent in these patients and are associated with significant morbidity and high mortality rates. This review discusses current cell therapies to prevent or treat viral infections/reactivations post-transplant. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The reader will gain an understanding of the current state of cell therapy to prevent and treat viral infections post-HSCT, and will be introduced to preclinical studies designed to develop and validate new manufacturing procedures intended to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce associated toxicities. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Reconstitution of HSCT recipients with antigen-specific T cells, produced either by allodepletion or in vitro reactivation, can offer an effective strategy to provide both immediate and long-term protection without harmful alloreactivity.

Abstract Objective Science and technology sector constituting of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence are contributing towards COVID-19. The aim of the present study is to discuss the various aspects of modern technology used to fight against COVID-19 crisis at different scales, including medical image processing, disease tracking, prediction outcomes, computational biology and medicines. Methods A progressive search of the database related to modern technology towards COVID-19 is made. Further, a brief review is done on the extracted information by assessing the various aspects of modern technologies for tackling COVID-19 pandemic. Results We provide a window of thoughts on review of the technology advances used to decrease and smother the substantial impact of the outburst. Though different studies relating to modern technology towards COVID-19 have come up, yet there are still constrained applications and contributions of technology in this fight. Conclusions On-going progress in the modern technology has contributed in improving people's lives and hence there is a solid conviction that validated research plans including artificial intelligence will be of significant advantage in helping people to fight this infection.

We report a case of 59-year-old female with non-alcoholic-steato-hepatitis (NASH) induced cirrhosis, who presented with hematochezia. The patient had a history of bleeding esophageal varices treated with endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Colonoscopy showed large rectal varices which were the source of her lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). Since endoscopic treatment for LGIB are limited, and because the patient had portal vein thrombosis which contraindicated transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), we performed percutaneous transhepatic embolization of her rectal varices using a new mixture of embolic and sclerotic agents, followed by Amplatzer plug 2 (AVP 2). To our knowledge, the use of this new mixture with the AVP 2 in the rectal varices treatment has not been previously published in literature. Our case provides an alternative treatment modality that can be used for rectal varices treatment, when TIPS and endoscopic management fails or is contraindicated.

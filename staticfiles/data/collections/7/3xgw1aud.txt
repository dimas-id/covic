Recognition of pathogen-derived carbohydrate constituents by antigen presenting cells is an important step in the induction of protective immunity. Here we investigated the interaction of L-SIGN (liver/lymph node specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin), a C-type lectin that functions as antigen receptor on human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, with egg-derived glycan antigens of the parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni. Our data demonstrate that L-SIGN binds both schistosomal soluble egg antigens (SEA) and egg glycosphingolipids, and can mediate internalization of SEA by L-SIGN expressing cells. Binding and internalization of SEA was strongly reduced after treatment of SEA with endoglycosidase H, whereas defucosylation affected neither binding nor internalization. These data indicate that L-SIGN predominantly interacts with oligomannosidic N-glycans of SEA. In contrast, binding to egg glycosphingolipids was completely abolished after defucosylation. Our data show that L-SIGN binds to a glycosphingolipid fraction containing fucosylated species with compositions of Hex(1)HexNAc(5-7)dHex(3-6)Cer, as evidenced by mass spectrometry. The L-SIGN "gain of function" mutant Ser363Val, which binds fucosylated Lewis antigens, did not bind to this fucosylated egg glycosphingolipid fraction, suggesting that L-SIGN displays different modes in binding fucoses of egg glycosphingolipids and Lewis antigens, respectively. Molecular modeling studies indicate that the preferred binding mode of L-SIGN to the respective fucosylated egg glycosphingolipid oligosaccharides involves a Fucalpha1-3GalNAcbeta1-4(Fucalpha1-3)GlcNAc tetrasaccharide at the nonreducing end. In conclusion, our data indicate that L-SIGN recognizes both oligomannosidic N-glycans and multiply fucosylated carbohydrate motifs within Schistosoma egg antigens, which demonstrates that L-SIGN has a broad but specific glycan recognition profile.

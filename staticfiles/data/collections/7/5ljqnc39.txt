Abstract Background The use of a multiplex molecular technique to identify the etiological pathogen of respiratory viral infections might be a support as clinical signs are not characteristic. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate a multiplex molecular real-time assay for the routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses, to analyze the symptoms associated with the pathogens detected and to determine the spread of virus during the period. Study design Respiratory samples were collected from children presenting with respiratory symptoms and attending the emergency unit during the 2010–2011 winter seasons. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder® 15 assay (PathoFinder™) which potentially detects 15 viruses. Results 857 (88.7%) of the 966 samples collected from 914 children were positive for one (683 samples) or multiple viruses (174 samples). The most prevalent were the respiratory syncytial virus (39.5%) and the rhinovirus (24.4%). Influenza viruses were detected in 139 (14.4%) samples. Adenovirus was detected in 93 (9.6%) samples, coronaviruses in 88 (9.1%), metapneumovirus in 51 (5.3%) and parainfluenzae in 47 (4.9%). Rhinovirus (40%) was the most prevalent pathogen in upper respiratory tract infections while respiratory syncytial virus (49.9%) was the most prevalent in lower respiratory tract infections. Co-infections were associated with severe respiratory symptoms. Conclusion The multiplex assay detected clinically important viruses in a single genomic test and thus will be useful for detecting several viruses causing respiratory tract disorders.

Objective: A novel human coronavirus, labeled as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), causing pneumonia is spreading around the world. At present, there are no specific treatments for COVID-19. β-sitosterol is well known for its multiple biological actions. This research aims to isolate and study the binding affinity of β-sitosterol for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) main protease (Mpro). Methods: Extraction and column chromatography was performed to isolate the β-sitosterol from an n-hexane extract of Muntingia calabura bark followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance TLC (HPTLC), Fourier-Transform infrared (FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The molecular docking studies were performed on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to determine the binding affinity of the β-sitosterol using PyRx Virtual Screening Tool. Results: In the present study, preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of carbohydrate, steroid, terpenoid, and flavonoid compounds. A total of 115 fractions was collected from column chromatography using benzene as a solvent by an isocratic elution technique. HPTLC fingerprinting analysis showed the presence of β-sitosterol under 366 nm. FTIR characterization was performed of the same fraction which gives the absorption peaks which resembles the β-sitosterol structure. Conclusion: The overall study concludes this method can be considered as a standard method for isolation of β-sitosterol from M. calabura bark. Favipiravir has a less binding affinity, i.e. -5.7 kcal/mol than β-sitosterol which has -6.9 kcal/mol. The number of hydrogen bonds formed by the favipiravir is much more, i.e., 4 than β-sitosterol which formed only 01 hydrogen bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Internal biliary fistula (IBF) is occurred spontaneously due to the biliary disease in most cases. Bilioenteric, biliobiliary, bronchobiliary, and vasculobiliary type of IBF have been reported in the literature. We herein describe our experience with an incidental cholecystojejunal fistula, a very rare type of bilioenteric fistula in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A 61-year-old woman with several years' history of intermittent right upper abdominal pain was admitted to Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital. Abdominal CT scan showed the pneumobilia in gallbladder with common bile duct dilatation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic sphincterotomy were done. On operative findings, there was a cholecystojejunal fistula. We performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy and fistulectomy with jejunal partial resection. To our knowledge, this is the first report on incidental cholecystojejunal fistula uncombined with any other disease and was treated with laparoscopic procedure.

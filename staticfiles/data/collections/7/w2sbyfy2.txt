Coronavirus spikes have the largest mass of any known viral spike molecule. The spike is a type 1 viral fusion protein, a class of trimeric surface glycoprotein proteins from diverse viral families that share many common structural and functional characteristics. Fusion proteins are mainly responsible for host cell receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion, and may perform other roles such as virus assembly and release via budding. The conformational changes that occur in the spike of intact SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) when it binds to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are described. Clues to the structural/functional relationships of membrane fusion have been made possible by the development of viral purification and inactivation methods, along with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and three-dimensional (3D) image processing of many different images containing multiple views of the spikes. These methods have allowed study of the spikes while still attached to virions that are noninfectious, but fusionally competent. The receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the SARS-CoV spike have been precisely localized within the spike. Receptor binding results in structural changes that have been observed in the spike molecule, and these appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion. A working model for the stepwise process of receptor binding, and subsequent membrane fusion in SARS-CoV is presented. Uniquely, the large size of the SARS-CoV spike allows structural changes to be observed by cryo-EM in the native state. This provides a useful model for studying the basic process of membrane fusion in general, which forms an essential part of the function of many cellular processes.

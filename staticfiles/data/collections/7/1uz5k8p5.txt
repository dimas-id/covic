Rationale: This study quantitatively measured the effects of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) on spirometry, static and dynamic lung and chest wall volume subdivision mechanics, and cardiopulmonary exercise measures. Methods: Patients with severe COPD (mean FEV1 = 23 ± 6% predicted) undergoing LVRS evaluation were recruited. Spirometry, plethysmography and exercise capacity were obtained within 6 months pre-LVRS and again within 12 months post- LVRS. Ventilatory mechanics were quantified using stationary optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) during spontaneous tidal breathing and during maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). Statistical significance was set at P< 0.05. Results:Ten consecutive patients met criteria for LVRS (5 females, 5 males, age: 62±6yrs). Post -LVRS (mean follow up 7 months ± 2 months), the group showed significant improvements in dyspnea scores (pre 4±1 versus post 2 ± 2), peak exercise workload (pre 37± 21 watts versus post 50 ± 27watts ), heart rate (pre 109±19 beats per minutes [bpm] versus post 118±19 bpm), duty cycle (pre 30.8 ± 3.8% versus post 38.0 ± 5.7%), and spirometric measurements (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] pre 23 ± 6% versus post 32 ± 13%, total lung capacity / residual lung volume pre 50 ± 8 versus 50 ± 11) . Six to 12 month changes in OEP measurements were observed in an increased percent contribution of the abdomen compartment during tidal breathing (41.2±6.2% versus 44.3±8.9%, P=0.03) and in percent contribution of the pulmonary ribcage compartment during MVV (34.5±10.3 versus 44.9±11.1%, P=0.02). Significant improvements in dynamic hyperinflation during MVV occurred, demonstrated by decreases rather than increases in end expiratory volume (EEV) in the pulmonary ribcage (pre 207.0 ± 288.2 ml versus post -85.0 ± 255.9 ml) and abdominal ribcage compartments (pre 229.1 ± 182.4 ml versus post -17.0 ± 136.2 ml) during the maneuver. Conclusions: Post-LVRS, patients with severe COPD demonstrate significant favorable changes in ventilatory mechanics, during tidal and maximal voluntary breathing. Future work is necessary to determine if these findings are clinically relevant, and extend to other environments such as exercise.

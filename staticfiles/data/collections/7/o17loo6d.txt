India is considered as a hot spot for emerging infectious diseases. In the recent past many infectious diseases of emerging and re-emerging nature have entered this subcontinent and affected a large number of populations. A few examples are Nipah, Avian influenza, Pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus and Chikungunya virus. These diseases have not only affected human and animal health but also economy of the country on a very large scale. During December 2010, National Institute of Virology, Pune detected Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus specific IgG antibodies in livestock serum samples from Gujarat and Rajasthan states. Subsequently, during January 2011 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus was confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak, in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India. Retrospective investigation of suspected human samples confirmed that the virus was present in Gujarat state, earlier to this outbreak. This disease has a case fatality rate ranging from 5 to 80 %. Earlier presence of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies have been detected in animal sera from Jammu and Kashmir, the western border districts, southern regions and Maharashtra state of India. The evidences of virus activity and antibodies were observed during and after the outbreak in human beings, ticks and domestic animals (buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep) from Gujarat State of India. During the year 2012, this virus was again reported in human beings and animals. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the four isolates of 2011, as well as the S segment from specimen of 2010 and 2012 were highly conserved and clustered together in the Asian/Middle East genotype IV. The S segment of South-Asia 2 type was closest to a Tajikistan strain TADJ/HU8966 of 1990. The present scenario in India suggests the need to look seriously into various important aspects of this zoonotic disease, which includes diagnosis, intervention, patient management, control of laboratory acquired and nosocomial infection, tick control, livestock survey and this, should be done in priority before it further spreads to other states. Being a high risk group pathogen, diagnosis is a major concern in India where only a few Biosafety level 3 laboratories exist and it needs to be addressed immediately before this disease becomes endemic in India.

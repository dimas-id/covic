We present a patient with a history of Mustard repair for transposition of the great arteries. The patient presented with complete inferior venous baffle obstruction and a large baffle leak after several years of cyanosis. Complete relief of the obstruction and exclusion of the baffle leak were accomplished with the use of a combination of bare metal stenting and the Gore(®) Excluder(®) aortic extender. To our knowledge, this represents the first reported use of the Gore(®) Excluder(®) aortic extender in the setting of inferior venous baffle leak and associated total inferior vena cava obstruction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently detected virus, which can cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections. Through this study, we aimed to detail the outcomes of hMPV infections. MATERIALS/METHODS: Between January 2012 and November 2017, patients who had hMPV detected in nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage by molecular respiratory pathogen tests were evaluated. The Food and Drug Administration cleared multiplexed‐polymerase chain reaction system (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) was used for diagnosis. Chest radiography (CR) and computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by an expert radiologist. RESULTS: In total 100 patients were included, the mean age was 22.9 (0‐87) years, and 50% were male. The hospitalization rate was 52%. Lower respiratory system infection (LRTI) was diagnosed in 44 patients with clinical findings, and in 31 patients out of 44 the radiological findings supported the diagnosis. The LRTI rate was significantly higher in adults than children (66.7%‐32.8%; P = 0.001). In CR, peribronchovascular infiltration (PI) was the most common feature seen in 14 out of 18 patients and was generally bilateral (13 out of 18 patients). In CT imaging, ground‐glass opacity was the most common finding seen in 11 out of 16 patients and nodular consolidation in five patients. Ribavirin was given to four patients, three of whom were severe and required respiratory support. None of the patients died of hMPV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The ground‐glass opacity in CT was similar to other respiratory virus infections, and PI in CR was very common and typical; however, nodular consolidation that may mimic bacterial infection was seen in one‐fourth of CT.

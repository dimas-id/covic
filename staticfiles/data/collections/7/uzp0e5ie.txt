CASE A twenty-two-year-old male patient presented to our trauma center after a motor-vehicle accident in which he sustained multiple injuries, including a volar dislocation of the hamate and ipsilateral scapholunate dissociation. Following closed reduction of the hamate dislocation, open reduction and stabilization of these carpal injuries was undertaken two days post-injury via a dorsal approach. Percutaneous Kirschner wires were used as well as two mini suture anchors to repair the scapholunate ligament. The patient was immobilized for six weeks and Kirschner wires were removed at twelve weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, hamate dislocation with scapholunate dissociation and its surgical treatment have not previously been described. Successful surgical treatment for this injury pattern may be performed dorsally via direct reduction and repair of the scapholunate ligament with percutaneous pinning of the affected carpal bones.

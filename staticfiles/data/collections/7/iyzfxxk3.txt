Many cases of reinforced endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction were reported in the literature. In most of these cases, the obstruction was related to the use of a resterilized tube with or without the use of nitrous oxide (N2O). Resterilization and autoclaving of the tube may result in dissection or formation of a bleb between the two layers of the tube that may expand after the use of N2O. We describe a case of acute non-resterilized reinforced ETT obstruction, by bleb formation, during occipital craniotomy under general anesthesia.

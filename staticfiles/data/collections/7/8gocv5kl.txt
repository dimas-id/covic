Abstract Objectives This study tested the effect of Epimedium-derived phytoestrogen (PE) on preventing steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) in rabbit model. Methods Thirty 28-week-old male New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into control group (CON; n =14) and PE group (PE; n =16; 5 mg/kg body weight/day) after receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON. Before and after inductive protocol, Dynamic-MRI was employed on bilateral femora for local intra-osseous perfusion, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis and lipid-transportation, and marrow samples were quantified for adipogenesis-gene mRNA expression. Six weeks later, bilateral femora were dissected for Micro-CT-based micro-angiography, and then ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis and extravascular fat-cell-size were examined histopathologically. Results The incidence of ON in the PE group (31%) was significantly lower than that in the CON group (93%). Compared to the CON group, local intra-osseous perfusion was maintained in the PE group. Blocked trunk vessels were seldom found in micro-angiography of the PE-treated rabbits. Thrombosis incidence and fat-cell-size were both significantly lower in the PE group than those in the CON group. During the early period after induction, indicator of coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation and adipogenesis-gene expression were found with significantly changing pattern in the PE group compared to the CON group. Conclusion PE was able to exert beneficial effect on preventing steroid-associated ON in rabbits with inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid deposition.

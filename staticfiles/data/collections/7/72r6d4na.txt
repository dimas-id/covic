Viral etiology has been postulated in a variety of neurological diseases in humans, including multiple sclerosis. Several experimental animal models of viral-induced neurodegenerative disease provide insight into potential host- and pathogen-dependent mechanisms involved in the disease process. Two such mouse models are the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection.

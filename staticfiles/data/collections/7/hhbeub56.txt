PURPOSE The anatomy of the inguinal region is notoriously challenging to master. We sought to teach open inguinal hernia (OIH) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) anatomy with simulation models among general surgery (GS) interns. METHODS Low-fidelity OIH and TEP models were constructed out of cardboard, plastic bins, fabric, and yarn. GS interns (n = 30) participated in a 3-h hernia session including a pretest, anatomy lecture, simulated OIH and TEP hernia repair, and posttest. Pre- and posttest scores were based on a difficult 30-point exam which included didactic questions (10 points), drawing relevant TEP (10 points), and OIH (10 points) anatomy. Participants were surveyed following the session. RESULTS Median pretest scores were 13 % (range 0-60 %). Median posttest scores improved to 47 % (range 20-93 %, p < 0.001). Median number of structures drawn in the TEP image improved from 2 (range 0-14) to 11 (range 1-21, p < 0.001). Median number of structures drawn in the OIH image improved from 3 (range 0-15) to 7 (range 1-19, p < 0.001). 67 % (12/18) demonstrated improvement in knowledge of abdominal wall layers. 23 % (7/30) knew the triangles of pain/doom on the pretest vs. 77 % (23/30) on the posttest. Mean Likert scores favored session enjoyability (4.5), not a waste of training time (4.4), and improved understanding of OIH and TEP anatomy (4.4, 4.2). CONCLUSIONS Low-fidelity simulators can be used to teach and assess knowledge of TEP and OIH anatomy. While enjoyable and useful, one 3-h session does not create master hernia surgeons or expert anatomists out of novice trainees.

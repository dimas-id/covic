A 35 year-old woman at 7-week gestational age was referred to our hospital. The patient was diagnosed with the heterotopic interstitial pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasonogra- phy after receiving in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer. Laparoscopic excision and curettage was successfully performed at 8.4-gestational age under general anesthesia and the patient was discharged 2 days after operation without any post-operative complications. The woman had normal antenatal follow-up and deliv- ered a healthy baby at term by cesarean section.

Purpose: This study sought to determine whether the necessitated use of telemedicine due to coronavirus disease 2019, and limited choice of both the provider and patient, impacts the perceptions of telemedicine by patients who experienced telemedicine prepandemic and those who first experienced telemedicine during the pandemic. Methodology: Participants for this survey were a convenience sample. An invitation to participate was shared through social media and e-mail listservs. To participate, individuals had to be at least 18 years of age and gave consent to their data being used. The online survey took âˆ¼10-15 min to complete, the survey was available from March 31 to April 20, 2020. Results: Two hundred sixty-four (n = 264, 60.8%) individuals had used telemedicine on or before December 2019 and 170 (39.2%) individuals used telemedicine for the first time January 2020 or later. There were no significant differences in demographics between groups, except that new users were more likely to have a primary care physician [F(407) = 13.51, p < 0.001]. Satisfaction of telemedicine was measured using a 10-item scale, demonstrating that all participants were overall satisfied with their telemedicine experience(s), (mean = 1.67, standard deviation = 0.61). Broadly, the differences in perceptions between the groups included the reasons for using telemedicine, perceptions of quality of in-person care, continuity of care, and a technical issue. Conclusions: Overall, patients are satisfied using telemedicine, however, for new users, both providers and patients, some acclimation needs to occur.

Viral infections remain one of the most frequent complications in patients with hematological malignancies, especially in those receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Viral infections result from reactivation of latent infection rather than from acquisition of new infection. Infections caused by herpes viruses, including cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, respiratory viruses and hepatitis B virus are frequently associated with high morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. Major advances have been made primarily by the availability of rapid diagnostic tests and the introduction of potent antiviral compounds into clinical practice.

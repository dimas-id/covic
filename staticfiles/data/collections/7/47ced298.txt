INTRODUCTION Gastric diverticulum is a rare and frequently asymptomatic condition. Symptoms include vague pain, fullness, dyspepsia, vomiting, hemorrhage and perforation. Occasionally, the patient can present with belching and oral fetor. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a 58-year-old woman with a gastric diverticulum who was suffering from a socially disabling oral fetor. After a thorough evaluation, a laparoscopic resection of the diverticulum was offered and completed successfully. At follow-up, the oral fetor had disappeared. The patient had no complaints and regarded herself as cured. DISCUSSION Although indications for the treatment of asymptomatic patients remain to be defined, pharmacological therapies including protein pump inhibitors and histamine receptor blockers have been employed, with limited effects in patients with miscellaneous symptoms. Surgery is required when serious complications such as hemorrhage or perforation of the diverticulum occur. CONCLUSION Surgery is required when serious complications such as hemorrhage or perforation of the diverticulum occur. Therapy resistent social disabling oral fetor may add to the indications for surgery.

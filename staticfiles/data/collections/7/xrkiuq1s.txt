In “Substance Use Disorders in Perinatal Women,” Kimberly Yonkers, M.D., gives a sobering presentation on the consequences of substance use in pregnant women, on the women themselves, their pregnancies, and their offspring, in the perinatal period. Yonkers' presentation took place April 25 as part of the American Psychiatric Association's (APA's) virtual online annual meeting; the meeting itself, scheduled to be in Philadelphia, was canceled due to COVID‐19. Yonkers' presentation touched on social justice as well as medical issues.

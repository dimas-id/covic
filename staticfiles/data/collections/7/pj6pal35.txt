Viruses have developed a large variety of transmembrane proteins to carry out their infectious cycles. Some of these proteins are simply anchored to membrane via transmembrane helices. Others, however, adopt more interesting structures to perform tasks such as mediating membrane fusion and forming ion-permeating channels. Due to the dynamic or plastic nature shown by many of the viral membrane proteins, structural and mechanistic understanding of these proteins has lagged behind their counterparts in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This chapter provides an overview of the use of NMR spectroscopy to unveil the transmembrane and membrane-proximal regions of viral membrane proteins, as well as their interactions with potential therapeutics.

High throughput screening, increased accuracy and the coupling of real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) to robotic set-up systems are beginning to revolutionise biotechnology. Applications of Q-PCR within biotechnology are discussed with particular emphasis on the following areas of biosafety and genetic stability testing: (a) determination of the biodistribution of gene therapy vectors in animals; (b) quantification of the residual DNA in final product therapeutics; (c) detection of viral and bacterial nucleic acid in contaminated cell banks and final products; (d) quantification of the level of virus removal in process validation viral clearance studies; (e) specific detection of retroviral RT activity in vaccines with high sensitivity; and (f) transgene copy number determination for monitoring genetic stability during production. Methods employed for Q-PCR assay validation as required in ICH Topic Q2A Validation of Analytical Methods: Definitions and Terminology (1st June 1995) are also reviewed.

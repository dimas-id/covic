The world is entering a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic in which there is an increasing call for reliable antibody testing. To support decision making on the deployment of serology for either population screening or diagnostics, we present a comprehensive comparison of serological COVID-19 assays. We show that the assay detecting total immunoglobulins against the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV-2, had optimal characteristics for antibody detection in different stages of disease.

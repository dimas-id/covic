Abstract We have studied the occurrence of hBoV, hMPV and InfA-B in an Apulian population with respiratory tract infections. During influenza season 2008â€“2009, 116 oropharingeal swabs were collected from patients affected by Influenza-Like Illness (ILI). The PCR products of hMPV M and HBoV NP-1 genes were sequenced. 78 out of 116 samples were positive for at least one respiratory virus; hBoV was detected in 53, hMPV in 22 and InfA-B in 41 out of 116 swabs. A high rate of hBoV infection in adult (18.9%) and elderly (26.4%) subjects was found. The co-infection rate was higher for hMPV (18/22 cases, 81.8%) compared to hBoV (26/53 cases, 49.1%), and InfA-B (25/41 cases, 61.0%). Co-infections were common in children. hBoV positive samples shared a high level of genetic similarity with the hBoV1 genotype, and hMPV positive samples clustered with A2 subgroup. Our results suggest that hBoV and hMPV play a role in ILI.

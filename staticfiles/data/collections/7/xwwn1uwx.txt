INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Although polypropylene (PP) is the most common biomaterial used to repair genital prolapse via vaginal route, its mechanical properties however remain obscure. METHODS An abdominal hernia rabbit model was used to evaluate retraction, solidity, and elasticity of the principal types of PP prostheses currently available, i.e., three large pore size monofilament prostheses, one heavy weight (HWPP), a second low weight (LWPP), and a third coated with atelocollagen (CPP). A small pore size multifilament PP (MPP) implant was also tested. RESULTS In comparison with HWPP (12%), LWPP (15%), and MPP (30%), CPP had less retraction (8% of the original size). Unlike pore size, weight prosthesis is not an influencing factor for retraction. Atelocollagen coating reduced retraction. HWPP and MPP were the most solid prostheses. MPP supported the greatest elastic force. CONCLUSIONS When the biomechanical parameters were comparatively assessed, HWPP was considered to have the most advantageous properties for prolapse surgery.

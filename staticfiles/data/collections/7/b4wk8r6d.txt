Testicular heat stress affects sperm quality and fertility. However, the chronology of these effects is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to establish the early sequential effects of heat stress in bull sperm quality. Semen and blood samples of Nellore breed bulls were collected and distributed into control and testicular heat stress (scrotal bags/96 h) groups. Semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, abnormalities, plasma membrane integrity, acrosomal membrane integrity, mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm lipid peroxidation, seminal plasma lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation. Blood plasma was also evaluated for lipid peroxidation. An increase in sperm abnormalities was observed 7 days following heat stress. After 14 days, sperm lipid peroxidation increased and mitochondrial membrane function, sperm motility, and plasma membrane integrity decreased. Heat stress effects were still observed after 21 days following heat stress. An increase in sperm DNA fragmentation was observed as a late effect after 28 days. Thus, the initial effects of heat stress (i.e., increasing sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation) suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the semen that alters mitochondrial function, sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and belatedly, DNA fragmentation. Although sperm abnormalities persisted and increased over time, sperm lipid peroxidation, in turn, increased only until 21 days after heat stress. In this regard, these findings provide a greater understanding of the chronological effects of experimentally induced heat stress on bovine sperm, providing valuable insights about spermatogenesis during the first 28 days following heat stress.

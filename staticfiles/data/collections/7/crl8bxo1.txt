Abstract Ubiquitination is the vital system for controlling protein degradation and regulation of basic cellular processes. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are emerging as an important regulator of several pathways related to cancer and other diseases. Their ability to detach ubiquitin from the target substrate and regulation of signaling makes it potential target to treat cancer and other fatal diseases. In the current review, we are trying to summarize deubiquitination, and their role in cancer and potential small molecules DUBs inhibitors which can be used as drugs for cancer treatment.

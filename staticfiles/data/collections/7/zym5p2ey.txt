BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Stent retriever thrombectomy and manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) have each been shown to lead to high rates of recanalization as single-modality endovascular stroke therapy. We sought to describe the safety and efficacy of a multimodal approach combining these two techniques termed 'stent retriever-mediated manual aspiration thrombectomy' (SMAT) and compared them to MAT alone. METHODS Retrospective review of a prospectively acquired acute endovascular stroke database. RESULTS 195 consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion were identified between July 2013 and April 2015. Occlusion distribution was as follows: 52% middle cerebral artery segment 1 (M1), 6% M2, 29% internal carotid artery, and 13% vertebrobasilar. Median onset to treatment time was 278 min. Intravenous rtPA was administered in 33% of cases, whereas 34% of cases had symptom onset beyond 8 h. Effective recanalization (TICI 2b/3) was achieved in 91% of patients and in 49% of patients, only a single pass was necessary. Median groin puncture to recanalization time was 40 min. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 5% of patients. Favorable outcomes defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 were noted in 42% of patients. Compared with MAT alone, SMAT achieved a similar rate of effective recanalization (91 vs. 88%, p = n.s.) but was associated with faster access to reperfusion times (49 vs. 77 min, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS SMAT is a safe and efficacious method to achieve rapid revascularization that leads to faster recanalization compared to manual aspiration alone. Future prospective comparisons are necessary to establish the most clinically effective therapy for acute thrombectomy.

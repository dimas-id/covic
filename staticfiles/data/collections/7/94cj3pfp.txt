Case Presentation A 68-year-old man presented to our ED with shortness of breath, weakness, and a 25-lb unintentional weight loss. He had undergone bilateral lung transplantation (cytomegalovirus [CMV]: donor+, recipient+; Epstein-Barr virus: donor+; recipient+) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 18 months prior. His posttransplant course was fairly unremarkable until 1 month earlier, when he was admitted for breathlessness and weakness. CT of the chest during that admission revealed mild intralobular and interlobular septal thickening. A bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsies did not show acute cellular rejection, but the BAL fluid was positive for coronavirus. His cortisol level was undetectable; he was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and fludrocortisone was initiated. He was taking prednisone, tacrolimus, and everolimus for immunosuppression and valganciclovir, itraconazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for antimicrobial prophylaxis. His 25-lb weight loss occurred over the span of just one month.

The most frequent cancer worldwide is skin cancer, occurring at epidemic rates in countries exposed to high levels of chronic ultraviolet radiation such as Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). Australia has the highest incidence of non‐melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in the world. NMSC is predominantly a cancer of the middle aged or elderly and accounts for considerable consulting and treatment time in most radiation oncology departments. Many patients also suffer from medical co‐morbidity, an important factor in any treatment decision.

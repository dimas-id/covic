Many of the decisions regarding the vaccination of cats relate to the animalâ€™s lifestyle. Vaccination requirements for the solitary indoor cat are very different than those for feral or free-roaming cats. Core vaccines include those directed against feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, and feline caliciviruses. Other important vaccines include the mandated rabies vaccination and also vaccination against feline leukemia. One significant issue with respect to feline vaccination is the development of injection site sarcomas. Although the prevalence of these is low and should not inhibit the use of vaccines, they are impossible to predict and very difficult to treat.

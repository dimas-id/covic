BACKGROUND: While institution-sponsored wellness programs may be effective, little is known about their availability and utilization in pediatric subspecialists, and about programs physicians wish were available. METHODS: A survey of perceptions about, and availability and utilization of institutional wellness activities, was distributed electronically to pediatric subspecialists nationally. Bivariate analyses were performed using χ(2) tests or independent t tests. Multivariable logistic regression models for categories of institution-sponsored programming as a function of potential predictors of program utilization were performed. Qualitative content analysis was performed for free-text survey answers. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of respondents participated in institution-sponsored wellness opportunities. Debriefs, Schwartz Center Rounds, mental health services, and team building events were the most available institution-sponsored wellness activities, whereas debriefs, team building, Schwartz Center Rounds, and pet therapy were most frequently utilized. Respondents desired greater social/emotional support, improved leadership, enhanced organizational support, and modifications to the physical work environment, with no significant differences across subspecialties for “wish list” items. CONCLUSIONS: Physician wellness requires more than a “one-size-fits-all” initiative. Our data highlight the importance of encouraging and normalizing self-care practices, and of listening to what physicians articulate about their needs. Pre-implementation needs assessment allows a “bottom-up” approach where physician voices can be heard.

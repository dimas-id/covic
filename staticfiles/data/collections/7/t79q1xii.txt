Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures have been restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part to reduce inpatient occupancy and minimize pressure on critical care and anaesthesia but also because of concern for the potential for transmission of infection via aerosols created by laparoscopy. Viral particles have now been identified in the blood, stool and peritoneal fluid of infected patients although the infectious potential of any such particles that may be carried via surgical gases is unclear.

To identify the prevalence and genetic variability of noroviruses in dogs, we tested fecal samples by using reverse transcriptionâ€“PCR. We found canine norovirus in 40% and 9% of dogs with and without diarrhea, respectively. The virus was genetically unrelated to other noroviruses and constitutes a tentative new genogroup.

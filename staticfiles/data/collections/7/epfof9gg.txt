BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE This study aims to describe the relationship between computed tomographic (CT) perfusion (CTP)-to-reperfusion time and clinical and radiological outcomes, in a cohort of patients who achieve successful reperfusion for acute ischemic stroke. METHODS We included data from the CRISP (Computed Tomographic Perfusion to Predict Response in Ischemic Stroke Project) in which all patients underwent a baseline CTP scan before endovascular therapy. Patients were included if they had a mismatch on their baseline CTP scan and achieved successful endovascular reperfusion. Patients with mismatch were categorized into target mismatch and malignant mismatch profiles, according to the volume of their Tmax >10s lesion volume (target mismatch, <100 mL; malignant mismatch, >100 mL). We investigated the impact of CTP-to-reperfusion times on probability of achieving functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2) at day 90 and radiographic outcomes at day 5. RESULTS Of 156 included patients, 108 (59%) had the target mismatch profile, and 48 (26%) had the malignant mismatch profile. In patients with the target mismatch profile, CTP-to-reperfusion time showed no association with functional independence (P=0.84), whereas in patients with malignant mismatch profile, CTP-to-reperfusion time was strongly associated with lower probability of functional independence (odds ratio, 0.08; P=0.003). Compared with patients with target mismatch, those with the malignant mismatch profile had significantly more infarct growth (90 [49-166] versus 43 [18-81] mL; P=0.006) and larger final infarct volumes (110 [61-155] versus 48 [21-99] mL; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Compared with target mismatch patients, those with the malignant profile experience faster infarct growth and a steeper decline in the odds of functional independence, with longer delays between baseline imaging and reperfusion. However, this does not exclude the possibility of treatment benefit in patients with a malignant profile.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW Severe acute respiratory syndrome is an emerging infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality and potential for global spread. This review highlights the salient points of the 2002-2003 outbreak to help clinicians with early recognition, treatment, disease control, and prevention. RECENT FINDINGS Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. The disease was first recognized in Asia in February 2003 and, over the next several months, spread to more than two dozen countries in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. The disease is characterized by fever with symptomatic and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. SUMMARY Because diagnosis cannot be established by clinical findings alone, epidemiologic findings (including history of travel to affected areas, close contact with other case patients, or linkage to clusters of unexplained pneumonia) play a critical role in the diagnostic evaluation. Infection control procedures (including droplet and airborne precautions) are critical for preventing transmission.

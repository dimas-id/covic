Preliminary investigations of human corneal tissues from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cadaveric donors indicated that no severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is present. Current eye banking guidelines do not recommend any type of routine testing for SARS-CoVâ€‘2 RNA in post-mortem donor tissue. This is partly based on factors that can influence the test results of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Enveloped virus particles 45 to 65 nm in diameter, tentatively called minicorona virus, were detected by electron microscopy in the intestinal contents of one normal and seven diarrheic calves in Quebec dairy herds. The agent was shown to be antigenically unrelated to the Nebraska calf diarrhea coronavirus and to the bovine viral diarrhea virus by counterimmunoelectrophoresis and fluorescent-antibody techniques. Antibodies against these particles were demonstrated in the serum of affected calves using immunoelectron microscopy. The agent could not be isolated in cell cultures and its possible role as etiological agent in calf diarrhea is still to be determined.

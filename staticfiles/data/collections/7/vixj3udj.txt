There are standard computational and statistical techniques of forecasting the spread pattern of a pandemic. In this article, we are going to show how close the forecasts can be if we use a simple numerical approach that can be worked out using just a scientific calculator. Using a few recent data, short term forecasts can be found very easily. In this numerical technique, we need not make any assumptions, unlike in the cases of using computational and statistical methods. Such numerical forecasts would be nearly perfect unless the pandemic suddenly starts retarding during the period of the forecasts naturally or otherwise.

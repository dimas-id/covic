Automated negotiation between computational agents or between agents and humans has been a subject of active research with a focus on obtaining better quality solutions within reasonable time frames. The critical issue negotiators face during automated negotiation is that a negotiator may not always know the personality type of the opponent. Studies show that having information about the opponent improves the outcome of negotiation in general. However, unless there is prior knowledge, learning the opponent type in the limited amount of time or number of rounds in a negotiation is a difficult task. In this paper, we use a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based modeling to perform better modeling of the opponent personality type. In particular, we focus on modeling the opponent into four different types to showcase that a better understanding of personality type can improve the outcome of automated negotiation. Our experiments performed using data sets generated from the IAGO software showcase that we indeed obtain better negotiation outcomes with a higher classification accuracy of the opponent personality type.

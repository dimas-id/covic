BACKGROUND: : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is already a pandemic. Few studies investigated the epidemic characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in the well-developed cities. METHODS: : Epidemiological data of 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected from the dataset of COVID-19 in Tianjin. All confirmed cases were categorized according to their potential infection sources. Daily numbers of confirmed cases of each category were plotted by date of onset, and the epidemic form of each category was inferred. RESULTS: : Among the 136 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 48 cases were categorized as imported cases and their close contacts, which were the majority of early cases. A total of 43 cases were found an epidemiological link to the Baodi department store, and they were inferred to be a common-source outbreak. Additionally, 35 cases were considered as familial clusters of COVID-19 cases, and 10 cases were sporadic. The 45 cases were inferred to be a propagated epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: : Local transmission of COVID-19 mainly occurred within families and a poorly ventilated public place in Tianjin. Besides the imported cases, the pattern of local transmission of COVID-19 was a mixture of the propagated epidemic and the common-source outbreak in Tianjin.

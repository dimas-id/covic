COVID-19 has posed major challenges for health care. Hospitals around the world have needed to rapidly prepare for the emerging pandemic. Translational simulation - simulation that is integrated and focused on emerging clinical priorities - offers numerous opportunities to aid in pandemic preparation. We describe our approach to preparing our institution's maternity services for the COVID-19 pandemic using translational simulation. We suggest lessons for providers of maternity services, and for those who support them through simulation activities.

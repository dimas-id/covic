We evaluated and compared a new bombesin analog [Tyr-Gly5, Nle(14)]-BBN(6-14) conjugated to DOTA or DTPA and radiolabeled with In-111 in low and high GRPR expressing tumor models. Both peptides were radiolabeled with high radiochemical purity and specific activity. In vitro assays on T-47D, LNCaP and PC-3 cells showed that the affinity of peptides is similar and a higher binding and internalization of DOTA-peptide to PC-3 cells was observed. Both peptides could target PC-3 and LNCaP tumors in vivo and both tumor types could be visualized by microSPECT/CT.

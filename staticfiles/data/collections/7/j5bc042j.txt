Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the condition, and their incidence increases with its severity. Some patients suffer frequent exacerbations leading to hospital admission, with considerable impact on their quality of life and activities of daily living. COPD exacerbations are associated with considerable physiological deterioration and increased airway inflammatory changes caused by factors such as viruses, bacteria and, possibly, common pollutants. Current evidence suggests that appropriate management and prevention of exacerbations may modify the long-term course of COPD.

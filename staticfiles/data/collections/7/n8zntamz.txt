Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is one of the important pathogens that may cause severe diarrhoea in piglets. In this study, the nucleocapsid (N) gene of a Chinese PEDV isolate designated HLJBY was cloned. The phylogeny of PEDV strains was investigated by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on the N protein sequences. The results indicate that there are two major groups of Chinese PEDVs, a Japanese PEDV group and a Korean PEDV group. High-level expression of the N protein was achieved in Escherichia coli. The immunoreactivity between PEDV particles or the bacterially expressed N protein and rabbit anti-PEDV serum was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays and Western blot. Both PEDV N protein and the polyclonal antibody generated in this study are valuable diagnostic reagents for PEDV surveillance.

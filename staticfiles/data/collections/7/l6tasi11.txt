We aimed to establish Human cell lines producing human monoclonal antibodies to the envelope E1/E2 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Two protocols for EBV immortalization of CD22‚Å∫ cells separated from HCV positive patients were used; 1) Immortalization with 100% EBV only, 2) immortalization by 30% EBV and CPG2006. Immortalization was checked microscopically and verified by screening the culture supernatant for antibody production using dot blot and ELISA analysis. ELISA plates were coated by HCV E1/E2 derived from cell lysate transfected by plasmid expressed HCV E1/E2. Also we tested the reactivity of human antibodies based on ELISA plates coating with one linear peptides derived from HCV E1 (a.a 315-319) and two peptides derived from HCV E2 (a.a 412-419) and (a.a 517-530). Neutralization activity was measured using H77C HCV retroviral pseudoparticles (HCVpp). Fifteen clones secreting human immunoglobulin G against HCV E1/E2 protein were isolated. Results of ELISA plates coated with HCV peptides showed that one antibody was binding to E2 peptide (a.a 517-530), and two antibodies binding to HCV E2 peptide (a.a 412-419). The three generated antibodies showed extremely neutralization activity against HCV pp. The three human antibodies were IgG3 and IgG2. These antibodies may be useful for passive immunotherapy of HCV infection.

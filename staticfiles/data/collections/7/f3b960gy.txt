BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery is an emerging modality. We incorporated this technique as an alternative to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. We investigated intraoperative and short-term outcomes following single-incision laparoscopic colectomy compared with hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy. METHODS Between July and November 2009, single-incision colorectal procedures were performed and matched to hand-assisted procedures based on five criteria: gender, age, body mass index, pathology, and type of procedure. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were assessed. RESULTS Twenty-four pairs of patients with a mean age of 55.1 years and mean body mass index of 28.5 kg/m(2) were matched. The majority of cases (79.2%) were right hemicolectomies. The ranges of incision length were 2-6 cm (single incision) and 5-11 cm (hand-assisted). Mean operating time was significantly longer for single-incision procedures (143.2 min) compared with hand-assisted procedures (112.8 min), p < 0.0004. There was no significant difference in the groups regarding conversions or intraoperative complications (p < 0.083 and p < 1.0, respectively). Mean length of stay for the single-incision approach (2.7 days) was significantly shorter compared with the hand-assisted approach (3.3 days), p < 0.02. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is a safe and feasible alternative to hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Although the technique required longer operative time, it resulted in smaller incision size and significantly shorter length of hospitalization.

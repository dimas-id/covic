The COVID-19 economic crisis makes it vitally important that workers who earned defined benefit pensions receive them at retirement. Unfortunately, billions of dollars that could help cushion the financial shock are sitting unclaimed, because the people who they belong to cannot locate the company responsible for paying them. As defined benefit pension plans have been terminated, merged and moved over the years, large numbers of deferred vested participants have not been notified about their benefits. The widespread and growing practice of insurance company pension buy-outs can be especially problematic for participants without notice. Broader use of electronic disclosures for pensions also threatens to make the situation worse. In the wake of COVID-19, policy makers should take steps to ensure that pension benefits are part of the economic recovery.

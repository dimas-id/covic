The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has potential to disproportionately and severely affect patients with neuromuscular (NM) disorders. In a short period of time, it has already caused reorganization of neuromuscular clinical care delivery and education, which will likely have lasting impact on the field. This paper reviews 1) potential NM complications of COVID-19, 2) assessment and mitigation of COVID-19-related risk for patients with pre-existing NM disease, 3) guidance for management of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, 4) practical guidance regarding NM care delivery, telemedicine and education, and 5) impact on neuromuscular research. We outline key unanswered clinical questions and highlight the need for team-based and inter-specialty collaboration. Primary goals of clinical research during this time are to develop evidence-based best practices and to minimize morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19 for patients with neuromuscular disorders.

In a rapidly evolving pandemic such as COVID‐19, theories which help unify disparate pre‐clinical and clinical observations would be useful. The current pandemic and its pleotropic effects can be explained in part by interaction between SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein S, the ACE2/L‐SIGN/CD209 receptor on the type II alveolar cell of the lung, and the DC‐SIGN receptor on the respiratory dendritic cell (DC) and associated endothelial cells. Infection of the DC by SARS‐CoV‐2 can potentially explain the exuberant distal immunopathology seen in COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

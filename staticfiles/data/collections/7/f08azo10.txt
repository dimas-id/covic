INTRODUCTION When esophagojejunostomy is performed using a circular stapler after laparoscopic total gastrectomy, fixing the anvil to the end of the esophagus is challenging. We describe an easy method for fixation of the anvil using a one-handed sliding-knot technique after the anvil has been inserted into the esophagus. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After removing the stomach, the main operator makes a whip stitch at the end of the esophagus using a long piece of monofilament string. Both ends of the string are pulled out from the port. A knot is then made and brought close the esophagus twice (sliding granny knots). After inserting the anvil into the esophagus, the main operator pulls the main standing string with one hand, applying vibration only. This causes the knots to tighten the anvil. Then, one or two knots are added to make sure that the anvil is firmly fixed in place. In addition, we routinely add one more ligation with a ready-made ligating loop. DISCUSSION This method is easy and reliable, and does not require special devices or skills when performing reconstruction after laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Because of these factors, it has the potential to be widely used to perform esophagojejunostomy.

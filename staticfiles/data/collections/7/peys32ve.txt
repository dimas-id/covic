Generations of nurses to come, now called heroes in the media, will have challenges in providing care for persons during this global pandemic. COVID-19 has impacted all demographics, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic class globally. African Americans have experienced a disproportionate number of deaths related to COVID-19 in the New Orleans and surrounding Metropolitan areas. According to the Louisiana Department of Health (2020), fifty-seven percent (57.40%) of the deaths in Louisiana related to COVID-19 have been African American (Black) and fifty-five percent (55.2%) have been males as of May 11, 2020. Social determinants of health are the conditions in which people age and the conditions they are born, grow, age and work. These conditions include neighborhoods, schools, and places of employment. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels (World Health Organization, 2020). Years later the same community that comprised "pre-and post-Katrina" are now facing this pandemic.

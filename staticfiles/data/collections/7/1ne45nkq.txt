Background Patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest are often transported to the closest hospital. Although it has been suggested that these patients be transported to cardiac resuscitation centers, few jurisdictions have acted on this recommendation. To better evaluate the evidence on this subject, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the currently available literature evaluating the association between the destination hospital's capability (cardiac resuscitation center or not) and resuscitation outcomes for adult patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was performed. Methods and Results PubMed, EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library databases were first searched using a specifically designed search strategy. Both original randomized controlled trials and observational studies were considered for inclusion. Cardiac resuscitation centers were defined as having on-site percutaneous coronary intervention and targeted temperature management capability at all times. The primary outcome measure was survival. Twelve nonrandomized observational studies were retained in this review. A total of 61 240 patients were included in the 10 studies that could be included in the meta-analysis regarding the survival outcome. Being transported to a cardiac resuscitation center was associated with an increase in survival (odds ratio=1.95 [95% confidence interval 1.47-2.59], P<0.001). Conclusions Adult patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest transported to cardiac resuscitation centers have better outcomes than their counterparts. When possible, it is reasonable to transport these patients directly to cardiac resuscitation centers (class II a, level of evidence B, nonrandomized).

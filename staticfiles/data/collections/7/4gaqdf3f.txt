Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumours of extra adrenal origin. Although it occurs rarely in the genitourinary system, urinary bladder is the most common site. Its diagnosis warrants complete surgical excision with lymphadenectomy in case of metastatic disease. The functional status of this tumour makes intraoperative handling challenging. Surgical resection necessitates minimal manipulation of tumour thereby mitigating intraoperative physiological jeopardy. We report the possibility of minimally invasive partial cystectomy with bilateral vesico-ureteric junction resection and re-implantation for non-malignant paraganglioma involving the bladder trigone. Intraoperative frozen section is deemed necessary to achieve tumour free margin status.

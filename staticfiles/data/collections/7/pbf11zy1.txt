The nucleolus is a dynamic subnuclear structure involved in ribosome subunit biogenesis, cell cycle control and mediating responses to cell stress, among other functions. While many different viruses target proteins to the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication, the effect of infection on the nucleolus in terms of morphology and protein content is unknown. Previously we have shown that the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein will localize to the nucleolus. In this study, using the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus, we have shown that virus infection results in a number of changes to the nucleolus both in terms of gross morphology and protein content. Using confocal microscopy coupled with fluorescent labelled nucleolar marker proteins we observed changes in the morphology of the nucleolus including an enlarged fibrillar centre. We found that the tumour suppressor protein, p53, which localizes normally to the nucleus and nucleolus, was redistributed predominately to the cytoplasm.

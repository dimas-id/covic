Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) dysfunction is conventionally managed with balloon angioplasty, stent extension, and sharp recanalization when necessary. We describe percutaneous transjugular recanalization and neointimal excision of a chronically occluded 17-year-old TIPS using excimer laser after conventional techniques were unsuccessful. Patient clinical improvement and shunt patency were documented three weeks post-intervention.

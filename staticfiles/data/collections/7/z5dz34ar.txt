BACKGROUND The enhanced-view totally extraperitoneal (eTEP) technique has been previously described for Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair. We present a novel application of the eTEP access technique for the repair of ventral and incisional hernias. METHODS Retrospective review of consecutive laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair cases utilizing the eTEP access approach from five hernia centers between August 2015 and October 2016 was conducted. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics, operative details, perioperative complications, and quality of life outcomes utilizing the Carolina's Comfort Scale (CCS) were included in our data analysis. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients with mean age of 54.9 years, mean BMI of 31.1 kg/m2, and median ASA of 2.0 were included in this analysis. Thirty-four percent of patients had a prior ventral or incisional hernia repair. Average mesh area of 634.4 cm2 was used for an average defect area of 132.1 cm2. Mean operative time, blood loss, and length of hospital stay were 218.9 min, 52.6 mL, and 1.8 days, respectively. There was one conversion to intraperitoneal mesh placement and one conversion to open retromuscular mesh placement. Postoperative complications consisted of seroma (n = 2) and trocar site dehiscence (n = 1). Comparison of mean pre- and postoperative CCS scores found significant improvements in pain (68%, p < 0.007) and movement limitations (87%, p < 0.004) at 6-month follow-up. There were no readmissions within 30 days and one hernia recurrence at mean follow-up of 332 Â± 122 days. CONCLUSIONS Our initial multicenter evaluation of the eTEP access technique for ventral and incisional hernias has found the approach feasible and effective. This novel approach offers flexible port set-up optimal for laparoscopic closure of defects, along with wide mesh coverage in the retromuscular space with minimal transfascial fixation.

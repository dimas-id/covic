The rapid, global spread of coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) has overwhelmed hospital functions in many countries. To ameliorate this crisis, it is important to protect health care providers (HCPs) from COVID‐19. Many intensive care associations advocate guidelines for airway management, since COVID‐19 is considered to spread via droplets from the patient. Additionally, coughing during tracheal intubation and extubation contaminates the area surrounding the patient and increases the risk of infection to HCPs.

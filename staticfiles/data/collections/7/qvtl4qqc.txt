Concentrations of nine metals were measured in eight common cultured fish species obtained from forty-three aquatic product markets across three cities in Xinjiang province, to establish fingerprint characteristics and assess potential human health risks due to the consumption of fish. Metal levels ([Formula: see text] g/kg, wet weight) in fish muscles were: 1204.88–5113.19 Al, 2.09–12.44 V, 6.10–31.86 Cr, 2368.80–8949.52 Fe, 2.01–10.26 Co, 4082.72–12785.68 Zn, 174.89–763.83 Cu, 0.33–2.24 Cd, and 5.74–9.90 Pb. Fingerprint analysis revealed that the studied fish species from the three cities exhibited a similar pattern of distribution. From the viewpoint of human health, the assessment of non-carcinogenic risk indicated no significant adverse health effects due to consumption of the assessed fish species.

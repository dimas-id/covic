BALB/c mice develop a neurologic demyelinating disease after inoculation of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), strain A59, by the intracranial, but not by the intraperitoneal route. To determine the mechanisms that prevent virus spreading through the blood-brain barrier, we analyzed expression of MHVR, a glycoprotein that serves as receptor for mouse hepatitis virus on endothelial cells of cerebral blood vessels. Our results indicated that MHVR was strongly expressed on the endoluminal pole of these cells. In addition, a direct virus binding assay showed that mouse hepatitis virus was able to bind endothelial cells via this receptor. Despite this expression of a functional viral receptor, in normal mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus by the contra-peritoneal route, no in vivo viral replication could be detected in endothelial cells from the brain, contrasting with the equivalent cells from the liver. However, shortly after i.v. administration of sodium dodecylsulfate detergent to the mice, virus infection of some cerebral endothelial cells was detected in a few mice. As a consequence of detergent treatment, virus infection was able to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results suggest that the protective role of the blood-brain barrier against spreading of mouse hepatitis virus A59 into the central nervous system is determined by a specific restriction of viral entry into the endothelial cells of cerebral origin.

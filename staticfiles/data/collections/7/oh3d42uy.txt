61 fecal samples from healthy foxes and 24 from healthy raccoon dogs were examined by RT-nested PCR assays for the presence and genotypic identification of Canine coronaviruses (CCVs). 77.0% fox samples were recognized as CCV positive, 43 of which belonged to type II and 29 to type I, as well as both genotypes were simultaneously detected in 25 samples. Out of the total 24 fecal samples from raccoon dogs, 22 were CCV positive for type II and 16 for type I. M gene fragments of 8 samples were sequenced, 4 of which were confirmed as CCV type I and the other 4 as CCV type II. Sequence analysis showed that the M gene of CCV type I had a high similarity of 96.7% - 98.1% between the fox-and raccoon dog strains and the reported Italian strain from diarrhea dogs. The two genotypes, with an identity of 88.3% - 89.7%, formed two separate branches in phylogenetic tree. Interestingly, the sequence at several nucleic acid sites of CCV type II differed between foxes and raccoon dogs. The co-existence and popularity of the two CCV genotypes in healthy foxes and raccoon dogs were first confirmed in this article.

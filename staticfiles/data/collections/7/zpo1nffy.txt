At the end of 2019, a novel flu-like coronavirus named COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was recognized by World Health Organization. No specific treatments exist for COVID-19 at this time. New evidence suggests that therapeutic options focusing on antiviral agents may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms as well as those that lead to the decrease in the inflammatory responses. Flavonoids, as phenolic compounds, have attracted considerable attention due to their various biological properties. In this review, the promising effects and possible mechanisms of action of naringenin, a citrus-derived flavonoid, against COVID-19 were discussed. We searched PubMed/Medline, Science direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases up to March 2020 using the definitive keywords. The evidence reviewed here indicates that naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 through the inhibition of COVID-19 main protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), and reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme receptors activity. One of the other mechanisms by which naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 is, at least partly, by attenuating inflammatory responses. The antiviral activity of the flavanone naringenin against some viruses has also been reported. On the whole, the favorable effects of naringenin lead to a conclusion that naringenin may be a promising treatment strategy against COVID-19.

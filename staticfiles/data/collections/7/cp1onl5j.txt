BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypoxemia in acute type A aortic dissection (AADA) is a common complication and is associated with negative outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of low-dose (5–10 ppm) inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the management of hypoxemia after AADA surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 patients who underwent surgical repair, 187 (42.9%) had hypoxemia and 43 were treated with low-dose iNO. After PSM, patients were included in the iNO treatment (n = 40) and PSM control (n = 94) groups in a 1:3 ratio. iNO ameliorated hypoxemia at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation, and shortened the durations of ventilator support (39.0 h (31.3–47.8) vs. 69.0 h (47.8–110.3), p < 0.001) and ICU stay (122.0 h (80.8–155.0) vs 179.5 h (114.0–258.0), p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in mortality, complications, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that low-dose iNO improved oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia after AADA surgery and shortened the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. No significant side effects or increase in postoperative mortality or morbidities were observed with iNO treatment. These findings warrant a randomized multicenter controlled trial to assess the exact efficiency of iNO for hypoxemia after AADA.

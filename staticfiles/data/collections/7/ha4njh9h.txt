Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has evolved into a viable alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Although CAS outcomes have improved during the last decade, the associated stroke rate remains higher when compared with carotid endarterectomy. Therefore, the pivotal role of embolic protection devices (EPDs) in minimizing stroke risk cannot be underestimated as a vital component of CAS. As technology advances, EPDs continue to be refined, and each device currently on the market has its own advantages and disadvantages. This review provides an overview of the current status of EPDs and highlights the unique features of each device, followed by suggestions for application in specific clinical scenarios.

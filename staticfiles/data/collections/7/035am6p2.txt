We report a new method of performing single-port laparoscopic surgery for appendiceal mucocele. The key points of our technique are placing a 3/4 circumferential skin incision with multiple radial splits on the confine of the umbilicus, use of a "home-made" multichannel port system, and trimming the skin incision straight through the confine of the umbilicus at the time of wound closure. A 65-year-old woman with appendiceal mucocele, 80 mm in diameter, successfully underwent ileocecal resection by this procedure. She remains in good health without any wound complications 8 months postoperatively.

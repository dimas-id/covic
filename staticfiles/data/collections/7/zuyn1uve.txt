INTRODUCTION Refinements in endovascular technology have revolutionized the treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) with the development of flow-diversion technology. The first generation of the Pipelin Embolization Device (PED) has demonstrated its safety and efficacy. However, the deployment technique was a difficult task that often led to complex maneuvers. The Pipeline Flex Embolization Device (PED Flex) is the second generation and its introduction has arrived with high expectations due to a completely redesigned delivery system that intends to overcome deployment difficulties seen in the previous generation. Areas covered: Preclinical studies, mechanism of action of flow-diverters, technical aspects and deployment system of the PED Flex, and clinical outcomes with both PED generations. Expert commentary: Flow diversion has allowed us to treat lesions that would be otherwise challenging for surgical clipping or unsuitable for other endosaccular strategies. Although the experience with PED Flex is limited, initial results suggest its safety and short-term efficacy.

In the last 30 years, development of minimally invasive percutaneous procedures to treat cardiovascular defects has been thriving. Although these techniques present obvious advantages, like avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass, the passage of catheter systems and the deployment of devices in the blood circulation can cause particle embolization that may result in stroke. In carotid artery stenting, cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) such as filtering membranes have been available for already 10 years. In transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), the development of CEPD is starting and three membrane-based devices are in clinical trials. There are controversial discussions about the efficacy of CEPD in TAVI. The experience with CEPD in carotid artery stenting can help to understand some of the technical issues and shortcomings of current devices and thereby ultimately reduce cerebral complication risks during TAVI procedures.

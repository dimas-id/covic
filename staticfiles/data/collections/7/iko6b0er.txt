PURPOSE To compare surgical outcomes of children with appendicitis treated with the transumbilical laparoscopically assisted appendectomy (TULAA) versus the conventional 3-port laparoscopic appendectomy (TPLA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective study of pediatric patients with appendicitis treated with TULAA or TPLA between January 2010 and December 2015. Operative time (OT), length of stay, cost, and surgical site infection rate were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Six hundred twenty-five appendectomies were performed [263 TULAA, 362 TPLA: acute (457), gangrenous (39), and perforated (129)]. TULAA had a shorter OT (median, 40 vs. 67 min; P<0.001), a shorter length of stay (median, 20 vs. 23 h; P<0.001), and a lesser cost (median $6266 vs. $8927; P<0.001). Surgical site infection rate was slightly higher in the TULAA group (6% vs. 4%; P=0.19). CONCLUSIONS TULAA had a shorter OT and was less costly than conventional TPLA. TULAA should be considered as the first surgical approach at treating appendicitis in children.

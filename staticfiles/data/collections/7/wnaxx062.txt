PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to describe the use of lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) for the management of children with melanoma and sarcomas. We report the experience of two children's hospitals that utilize this technique to identify sentinel lymph nodes for lymph-node biopsy and dissection. METHODS We identified 56 patients (median age 10.8 years) who underwent 58 lymphoscintigraphy procedures. There were 33 patients with melanoma and melanocytic lesions, and 23 with sarcomas. RESULTS Of 58 lymphoscintigraphy procedures, sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 52 (90% success rate). Using the combination of intraoperative blue dye injection and lymphoscintigraphy, the success rate was 95% (55/58). Metastatic disease was found in 14 sentinel lymph nodes (13 patients with melanoma and melanocytic lesions, and 1 patient with rhabdomyosarcoma). CONCLUSION We have found that lymphoscintigraphy with SLNB is an effective method to identify patients who may benefit from more extensive lymph-node dissection and to identify those patients who are unlikely to benefit from further lymph-node exploration.

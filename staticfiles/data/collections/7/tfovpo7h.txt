Plenty of serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed so far, thus documenting the importance of evaluating the relevant features of the immune response to this viral agent. The performance of these assays is currently under investigation. Amongst them, LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG by DiaSorin and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 cobas by Roche are currently used by laboratory medicine hospital departments in Italy and many other countries. In the present study, we have firstly compared two serologic tests on serum samples collected at two different time points from forty-six laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects. Secondly, eighty-five negative serum samples collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were analyzed. Thirdly, possible correlations between antibody levels and the resulting neutralizing activity against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated. Results revealed that both tests are endowed with low sensitivity on the day of hospital admission, which increased to 97.8 and 100% for samples collected after 15 days for DiaSorin and Roche tests, respectively. The specificity of the two tests ranges from 96.5 to 100%, respectively. Importantly, a poor direct correlation between antibody titers and neutralizing activity levels was evidenced in the present study.

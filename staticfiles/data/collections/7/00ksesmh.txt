Abstract The potent role of thymol, a natural compound, in modulation of macrophage activity was evaluated by determining all the sequential steps involved during phagocytosis. We found a significant increase in the proliferation of splenocytes in the presence of thymol and it proved to be a good mitogen. Uptake capacity of macrophages was enhanced due to increased membrane fluidity after treatment with thymol and it also increases lysosomal activity of macrophages. Data of superoxide anion generation revealed the involvement of thymol in the generation of respiratory burst as it potentiated this property of macrophages at a concentration of 150μM. In the case of TNF-α, IL-1ß and PGE2 a decreased level of secretion was observed 154ρg/ml, 736.1ρg/ml, and 151ρg/ml respectively when compared with lipopolysaccharide treated cells, where the level of these cytokines was significantly high. We also determined the anti-complementary activity of thymol which showed to be more effective than rosmarinic acid. Thus, the results obtained from the study suggest the potential role of thymol as a natural immunostimulatory drug which can be used in the treatment of various immunological disorders.

In December 2019, a new severe respiratory coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was detected and has since spread across the globe to be ultimately declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. For physicians and allied medical professionals, the period since has been marked by an increased and rapidly changing flow of information from multiple regional, national and international health authorities, regulating bodies and professional associations. Although social media platforms have an active presence in the instant dissemination of information and medical professionals display active participation in them, traditional channels such as email are still being emphasized as a means of communication. This article discusses the opportunities offered by social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit and TikTok to disseminate medical information both for the use of physicians and as a means to communicate essential information to the public at large.

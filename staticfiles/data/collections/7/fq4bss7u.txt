We appreciate the opportunity to respond to the comments by Drs. Arian Arjomandi Rad, Robert Vardanyan and Natalie R Tas. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in many countries for the relief of symptoms of pain, inflammation and fever, which reduce the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin (PGI2), and thromboxane (Tx) A2 by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX). At present, it is recognized that there are two related but different types of COX activity, COX-1 and COX-2.

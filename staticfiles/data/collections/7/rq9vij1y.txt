Abstract Neospora caninum infection has been reported in a large number of intermediate hosts, such as ruminants, rabbits, mice, etc. but neosporosis has emerged as a serious disease in cattle and dogs worldwide. Abortions and other infertility issues have been reported in the infected cows, leading to great economic losses in farmers. The aim of our study was to assess N. caninum seroprevalence in dairy cattle from Northern Greece (region of Xanthi) by using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique. Blood samples were collected from 875 Holstein â€“ Friesian dairy cows and tested for Neospora caninum antibodies. Among the cows that were studied, 184 (21.03%) were positive for N. caninum antibodies and concurrently their farms had a known previous history of infertility problems, such as abortions, increased number of artificial inseminations needed for conception, increased rate of returning to estrus and retention of fetal membranes.

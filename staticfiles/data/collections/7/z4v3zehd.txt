The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has created a global pandemic responsible for over 500,000 deaths and untold human and economic suffering. Attention has rightly focused on the respiratory system, because this is where a life-and-death battle is waged between the viral horde and the host's immune system. However, other tissues are also susceptible to viral attack including the kidney, heart and brain. The purpose of this communication is to highlight the evidence that the male reproductive system, particularly spermatozoa, constitute another vulnerable target, raising the possibility that COVID-19 might ultimately induce male infertility and/or facilitate the sexual transmission of this virus, depending on the level of infection.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) are complex and involve the interplay of infectious agents, management and environmental factors. Previous studies of BRD focused on ante‐mortem samples from the upper respiratory tract and identified several unconventional viruses. The lung, however, is the primary location where significant BRD lesions are usually found and is a common post‐mortem diagnostic specimen. In this study, results of high‐throughput virome sequencing, bacterial culture, targeted real‐time PCR and histological examination of 130 bovine pneumonic lungs from western Canadian cattle were combined to explore associations of microorganisms with different types of pneumonia. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia (FBP) was the predominant type of pneumonia (46.2%, 60/130) and was associated with the detection of Mannheimia haemolytica. Detection of Histophilus somni and Pasteurella multocida was associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia (SBP) and concurrent bronchopneumonia and bronchointerstitial pneumonia (BP&BIP), respectively. Sixteen viruses were identified, of which bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) was the most prevalent (11.5%, 15/130) followed by ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 (UTPV1, 8.5%, 11/130) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV, 8.5%, 11/130). None of these viruses, however, were significantly associated with a particular type of pneumonia. Unconventional viruses such as influenza D virus (IDV) and bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) were detected, although sparsely, consistent with our previous findings in upper respiratory tract samples. Taken together, our results show that while virus detection in post‐mortem lung samples is of relatively little diagnostic value, the strong associations of H. somni and M. haemolytica with SBP and FBP, respectively, indicate that histopathology can be useful in differentiating bacterial aetiologies.

We present a simple and versatile method for calculating the maximum capacity of public spaces constrained to social distancing, following the recommended measures of the WHO due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. This method assumes a minimum required distance of two meters between persons and is tested in four actual plazas. Additionally, we estimate public space capacity in case of public events, such as markets or concerts. We believe our method will directly provide guidelines for crowd control in the so-called"new normality", serving as a first step for future and more accurate developments.

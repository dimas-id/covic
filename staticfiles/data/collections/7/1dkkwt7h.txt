We updated previous estimates (wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-0679_article) of adults with any underlying condition increasing risk of complications from COVID-19 using recent US hospitalization data instead of mortality data from China. This substitutes obesity for cancer in the definition and increased the percentage of adults reporting more than 1 condition to 56.0% (95% CI 55.7-56.4). When controlled for all measures listed, factors increasing odds of reporting any of the underlying conditions include being male, older, African American, American Indian, household income <$25,000, < high school education, underinsurance, living in the South or Midwest (vs. West), plus the risk factors of ever smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption. Population-attributable risk for the listed risk factors was 13.0%, 12.6%, and 15.0% respectively. Results have potential implications for policies based on risk-stratification of the population and for improvement of risk status through lifestyle change. National support for a health promotion campaign would be timely.

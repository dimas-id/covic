It is an essential task to discuss the death cases for clinicians. During the emergent public events, the report and analysis of death cases is of far-reaching significance. The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has brought huge losses to China, and the medical system has been sustaining tremendous pressure. The best weapon to defeat the epidemic is medical data and related scientific research, of which the systematic analysis and efficient use of death cases is a key step. Based on the incomplete record of death case report, the lack of humanistic perspective and patient report, every department and institution is facing great challenge in terms of data management. Given that the relevant systems need to be improved, and that the integration of standardized reports and clinical research is not mature,as well as other problems, we put forward several methodological suggestions: â Establish national medical and health data center and improve relevant laws and regulations. â¡ Increase investment in medical data management and start data collection and analysis as early as possible during the epidemic. â¢ Refine the content of death case report and promote the standardization of report. â£ Pay close attention to the report of death cases, review, summary and analysis. More importantly, we should continue to build and improve platforms and programs related to disease control, carry out epidemic-associated scientific research, enhance the managing efficiency of public health data, elevate the anti-risk capability of our medical system, and promote the steady progress of the health China strategy.

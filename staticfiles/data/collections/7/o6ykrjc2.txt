Poultry parvoviruses identified during the early 1980s are found worldwide in intestines from young birds with enteric disease syndromes as well as healthy birds. The chicken parvovirus (ChPV) and turkey parvovirus (TuPV) belong to the Aveparvovirus genus within the subfamily Parvovirinae. Poultry parvoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses consisting of three open reading frames, the first two encoding the non-structural protein (NS) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP) and the third encoding the viral capsid proteins 1 (VP1 and VP2). In contrast to other parvoviruses, the VP1-unique region does not contain the phospholipase A2 sequence motif. Recent experimental studies suggested the parvoviruses to be the candidate pathogens in cases of enteric disease syndrome. Current diagnostic methods for poultry parvovirus detection include PCR, real-time PCR, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant VP2 or VP1 capsid proteins. Moreover, sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms have allowed rapid and simultaneous detection of the parvovirus from affected and healthy birds. There is no commercial vaccine; hence, the development of an effective vaccine to control the spread of infection should be of primary importance. This review presents the current knowledge on poultry parvoviruses with emphasis on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship, genomic analysis, epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic methods.

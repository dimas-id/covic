On 5 December 2002 the Australian Senate passed the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, which regulates stem cell research. The bill introduces some restrictions with regard to the use of stored frozen embryos, which are not destined to be implanted. The bill states that only frozen embryos created before April 2002 can be used for research purposes, provided that the individuals whom these embryos relate to give their consent. The alternative to this restriction would have been no research at all, and this would have happened if the law had been stopped. The Australian scientists regarded the new law as a compromise that would undoubtedly slow down research, but not entirely stop it.

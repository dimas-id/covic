BACKGROUND Single incision laparoscopic surgery, especially transumbilical, should be the closest to replicate the minimal access results achieved by natural orifice endoscopic surgery (NOTES). This study of single incision transabdominal preperitoneal (SITAPP) inguinal hernia repair is a continuing study exploring the peroperative variables and short and long term complications of this procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS All the 183 patients were operated by the same surgeon through a horizontal transumbilical incision positioned across the lower third of the umbilicus. Port access was through three separate transfacial punctures. Routine rigid instruments were used and the peritoneal flaps were either tacked or sutured into place. Patients with irreducible hernia and obstructed hernia were included, while those with strangulated hernia were excluded. RESULTS All the patients were male with an average age of 41.4 years. Twenty four patients had bilateral hernia, 15 patients had irreducible and 6 patients had obstructed hernia. The mean operating time was 38.3 mins for unilateral hernias completed with tackers and 42.8 mins in those with intracorporeal suturing. The corresponding operating time for bilateral hernias was 53.2 and 62.7 minutes. There was minimal serous discharge from the umbilicus in 8 patients, port site infection in 1 patient and recurrence in 2 patients over a 36 months period. CONCLUSIONS SITAPP for groin hernias, performed with conventional instruments is feasible, easy to learn, has a very high patient acceptance and is cosmetically superior to conventional TAPP. The use of tackers reduces the operating time significantly.

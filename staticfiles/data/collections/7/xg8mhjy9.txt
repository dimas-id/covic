OBJECTIVE To present the experience with the extraperitoneal approach for robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) in a technique replicating the vesicocapsular incision technique of open surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS RASP was performed on patients with a prostate volume of >80 cm(3) with an indication for open enucleation of the prostate. Preoperatively, all patients were evaluated by uroflowmetry, prostate-specific antigen level, and postvoid residual measurement, as well as by the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire. All perioperative data were recorded in a prospective database. Follow-up appointments included the aforementioned measurements and were scheduled at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS Ten RASP procedures were successfully performed by the extraperitoneal approach. Mean patient age and prostate volume were 63.1 years (range, 55-74 years) and 129.4 cm(3) (range, 90-170 cm(3)), respectively. Mean operative time was 122.5 minutes (range, 85-140 minutes) and represented the time from the first incision to the closure of the all incisions. The estimated blood loss was minimal (mean value, 230 mL). Transfusions were not necessary. Mean catheterization period was 7.4 days (range, 6-8 days). The symptomatology, as reported by the International Prostate Symptom Score, was improved at the follow-up appointments in comparison with the baseline values. One case of prolonged fever was noted postoperatively and managed by antibiotics. CONCLUSION The extraperitoneal approach for RASP proved to be efficient in the management of large prostates. The results are directly comparable with the current available experience with transperitoneal RASP. The extraperitoneal RASP seems to favorably compare with the open simple prostatectomy, while the results are at least comparable with those of conventional laparoscopic approach.

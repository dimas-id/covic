BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel communicable disease, novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out. We aimed to analyze the characteristics and severity of patients with myocardial damage in NCIP. METHODS: We enrolled 215 adult patients with NCIP from January 2020 to February 2020. Outcomes were followed up until March 1st, 2020. RESULTS: 28.37% of the total patients showed increased level of TnI (> 0.040 ng/ml). Patients were older and had more cardiovascular complications in increased TnI group. Higher CRP, NT-proBNP, lower immune CD3, CD4 and CD8 cell account and more involved lobes detected by CT scan in the lung were observed in increased TnI group. Patients with elevated TnI had higher CRUB-65 scores and were more likely given glucocorticoid therapy and mechanical ventilation than patients in normal TnI group. CONCLUSIONS: Markers of cardiomyocyte injury were elevated not least in elderly males with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Patients with elevated TnI presented more severe situation, leading to multiple organ dysfunctions, which appeared as a pivotal feature of patients with NCIP that requires attention by clinicians in order to provide necessary treatment as soon as possible and improve patients' outcomes.

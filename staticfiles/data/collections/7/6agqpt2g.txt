Objective@#To evaluate the efficacies of lopinavir/ritonavir and abidol in the treatment of NCP.@*Methods@#The clinical data of 134 patients with NCP receiving treatment at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center during Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 were retrospectively collected. All the patients received interferon-&#x03B1;2b spray and symptomatic supportive treatment, and 52 cases received oral lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, 34 cases received oral abidol treatment, the remaining 48 cases did not take any antiviral drugs. The efficacies at median day 7 among the three groups were compared by using Kruskal-Wallis or chi-square tests.@*Results@#The 134 patients included 69 males (51.5%) and 65 females, aged 35-62 years with the average of 48 years. The median time to temperature normalization in patients receiving abidol or lopinavir/ritonavir treatment was both 6 days after admission, and that was 4 days in the control group, with no significant difference (&#x03C7;2=2.37, P=0.31). The median time to PCR negative in the respiratory specimens in the three groups was all 7 days after admission, and the PCR negative rates at day 7 after admission in lopinavir/ritonavir, abidol and control groups were 71.8% (28/39), 82.6% (19/23) and 77.1% (27/35), respectively, which were not significantly different (&#x03C7;2=0.46, P=0.79). Radiological worsening at day 7 was observed in comparable proportions of patients in the three groups, which were 42.3% (n=22), 35.3% (n=12) and 52.1% (n=25), respectively (&#x03C7;2=2.38, P=0.30) . Adverse reactions occurred in 17.3% (n=9), 8.8% (n=3) and 8.3% (n=4) patients, respectively in the three groups (&#x03C7;2=2.33, P=0.33).@*Conclusions@#This study did not find any effects of lopinavir/ritonavir and abidol on relieving symptoms or accelerating virus clearance. The efficacies of these two drugs in NCP treatment need further investigation.

Emerging infectious diseases and organisms present critical issues of national security public health, and economic welfare. We still understand little about the zoonotic potential of many viruses. To this end, we are developing novel database tools to manage comparative genomic datasets. These tools add value because they allow us to summarize the direction, frequency and order of genomic changes. We will perform numerous real world tests with our tools with both Avian Influenza and Coronaviruses.

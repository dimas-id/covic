Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in China. Two cases of neonates with positive 2019-nCoV tests have been reported. Due to the immature immune system and the possibility of vertical transmission from mother to infant, neonates have become a high-risk group susceptible to 2019-nCoV, which emphasize a close cooperation from both perinatal and neonatal pediatrics. In neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), to prevent and control infection, there should be practical measures to ensure the optimal management of children potentially to be infected. According to the latest 2019-nCoV national management plan and the actual situation, the Chinese Neonatal 2019-nCoV expert working Group has put forward measures on the prevention and control of neonatal 2019-nCoV infection.

We aim to assess the surgical outcomes of our novel hysteropexy procedure, laparoscopic long mesh surgery (LLMS) with augmented round ligaments. Twenty-five consecutive women with stage II or greater main uterine prolapse defined by the POP quantification staging system were referred for LLMS. Long mesh is a synthetic T-shaped mesh, with the body fixed at the uterine cervix and the two arms fixed along the bilateral round ligaments. The clinical evaluations performed before and 6 months after surgery included pelvic examinations, urodynamic studies, and questionnaires for urinary and sexual symptoms. After a follow-up time of 12 to 24 months, the anatomical reduction rate was 92% (23/25) for the apical compartment. The average operative time was 65.4 Â± 28.8 minutes. No major complications were recognized during LLMS. The lower urinary tract symptoms and scores on the questionnaires improved significantly after the surgery, except urgency urinary incontinence and nocturia. Neither voiding nor storage dysfunction was observed after the operations. All of the domains and total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scores of the 15 sexually active women did not differ significantly after LLMS. The results of our study suggest that LLMS is an effective, safe, and time-saving hysteropexy surgery for the treatment of apical prolapse.

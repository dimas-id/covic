BACKGROUND The aim was to evaluate the effects of current parenteral nutrition (PN) treatment on clinical outcomes in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS This review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: 4201707915). RESULTS Two underpowered randomized controlled trials and six observational studies were retrieved (n = 894 patients). Health-related quality of life and physical function may improve during anti-neoplastic treatment in who PN treatment is the only feeding opportunity, but not necessarily in patients able to feed enterally. Nutritional status may improve in patients regardless of anti-neoplastic treatment and gastrointestinal function. PN treatment was neither superior to fluid in terminal patients nor to dietary counselling in patients able to feed enterally in regards to survival. The total incidence of adverse events was low. CONCLUSION Current PN treatment in patients with advanced cancer is understudied and the level of evidence is weak.

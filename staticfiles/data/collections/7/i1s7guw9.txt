INTRODUCTION: In order to stem the spread of an epidemic, widespread adherence to safety measures and their acceptance within the German population are of key importance. This survey examines the levels of knowledge and the perception of risk within the population and analyses implementation and adherence to the recommended and legally mandated safety measures in the early phase of the COVID-19-pandemic. METHODS: In March 2020, participants registered on the HeReCa-Online-Panel from Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Schleswig Holstein were invited to complete a 65 question survey. RESULTS: 1 048 respondents answered the questionnaire, which amounts to a response of 3.5%. 83% of respondents stated that they felt themselves to be well-informed or very well-informed concerning COVID-19 and the coronavirus. The majority of respondents reported fears for the well-being of family members (60%) or the health of the German population as a whole (45%); 79% reported concerns regarding adverse economic impacts. 79% of respondents have implemented individual protective measures, such as reducing social contacts and maintaining the recommended physical distance in public spaces. Most respondents regarded the government mandated safety measures as predominantly reasonable and appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: In the early phase of the pandemic, most people informed themselves of COVID-19 and started to take individual measures for risk reduction. Acceptance of governmental measures to stem the spread of the pandemic was high.

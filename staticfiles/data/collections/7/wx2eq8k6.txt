A case of a Salmonella infantis septicemia in a primate (Macaca mulatta) probably induced by shipment stress gave rise to microbiological examination of fecal samples from all animals of a since 1976 closed colony of Macaca mulatta and Macaca arctoides. During 3 investigations carried out in 3 week intervals salmonella-positive animals were separated immediately from the stock. At the first examination 3 of 52, and at the second 2 of 49 samples were found to be salmonella-positive. At the third series all of the remaining 47 animals proved to be salmonella-negative. All isolates were identified as S. infantis. Feeding of contaminated, dried prawns was suspected as the most probable source of infection. A simultaneous examination of 96 of the stool specimens revealed Y. enterocolitica in 4 samples. Additionally, electron-microscopy of pooled fecal samples (3 to 4 animals each) led to demonstration of corona-, adenovirus and small round virus-like particles in one pool each. Moreover, coronavirus-like particles could be detected in 7 of 13 (1st examination series), 5 of 15 (2nd series) and 1 of 13 pools (3rd series).

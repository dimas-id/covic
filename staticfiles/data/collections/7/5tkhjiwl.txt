Summary Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by a virus that predominantly replicates in alveolar macrophages. The aim of the present study was to characterize the production of cytokines by subpopulations of pulmonary macrophages in pigs infected by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Expression of interleukin (IL) 1α, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α correlated with the severity of pulmonary pathology and the numbers of pulmonary macrophages. Significant correlations were observed between PRRSV infection and the expression of IL-10, between the expression of IL-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-γ, and between the expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ. These findings suggest that PRRSV modulates the immune response by the up-regulation of IL-10, which may in turn reduce expression of cytokines involved in viral clearance (e.g. IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-12p40 and TNF-α). The results also suggest that expression of IFN-γ is stimulated by IL-12p40 and TNF-α, but not by IFN-α. All of these cytokines were expressed mainly by septal macrophages with weaker expression by alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. There appears to be differential activation of septal and alveolar macrophages in PRRSV infection, with septal macrophages being the major source of cytokines.

Abstract. Tadham Moor in Somerset, England, is an exceptionally rich wetland site which has been mown for hay for many years, with stock grazing the aftermath, but with no history of any fertilizer use. A randomized blocks field experiment (1986–1989) was used to study the effects of five levels of nitrogen input treatments: 0 = control, 25, 50, 100 and 200 kg of N fertilizer per ha per yr. In Phase II of the experiment (1990–1993), each plot was split into two subplots. The allocated fertilizer treatment for the plot was continued in one, randomly selected, subplot but the treatment was discontinued in the other subplot. The experiment not only identified and quantified the changes occurring in the vegetation of hay meadows under different levels of N input, it also provided valuable insight into the dynamics of the sward upon the discontinuance of the treatments. The data for Phase II were used to estimate the time required by the changed vegetation (under different nitrogen treatments) to revert to a state comparable to that prevailing in the control plots. A method for estimating reversion times is described. The main difficulties in estimating the reversion times are identified, the choice of robust vegetation variables being critical. Reversion time estimation methods are presented and used to obtain working estimates for the four nitrogen treatments, applied for 5 yr. These estimates are 3, 5, 7 and 9 yr respectively. The validity of the estimates of 3 yr for the lowest nitrogen input treatment (25 kg /ha/yr) was checked using the available post cessation data.

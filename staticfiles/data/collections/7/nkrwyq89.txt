By April 29, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the United States has exceeded one million, becoming the country with the most serious pandemic in the world. It is urgent to analyze the real situation and follow-up trend of the epidemic in the United States. The proposed model divides the time period into two different phases, before and after March 21, 2020. The results show that the basic reproduction number in the early period of propagation in the United States is estimated to be 4.06 (95% CI: 1.86-6.73) based on the confirmed cases data ranging from January 21, 2020 to March 21, 2020. The normalized contributions to R_0 for three different categories of communicators were estimated, including the numbers of the latent population (in incubation period) L, the documented infectious population Id, and the undocumented infectious population Iu. The results show that L contributes 16.17% (95% CI: 12.86% - 21.60%) to R_0, Id contributes 55.13% (95% CI: 43.15% - 63.97%), and Iu contributes 28.70% (95% CI: 19.29% - 40.07%) to R0. The metapopulation network was used to simulate the true spread of COVID-19 in the United States, and the Bayesian inference was applied to estimate the key parameters including the rate of the number of the susceptibles and the infected beta, the infection ratio between undocumented and documented transmission 1, the infection ratio between latent and documented transmission 2, the proportion of confirmed cases in the infectious population x, and the duration of latent period (incubation period) TL . From the analysis of phase one, 1 was estimated to be 0.40 (95% CI: 0.17 - 0.54), 2 was estimated to be 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02 - 0.11), x was estimated to be 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55 - 0.78), T_L was estimated to be 8.41 (95% CI: 6.64 - 9.42). As of April 13, 2020, it was estimated that only 45% (95% CI: 35% - 73%) of symptom onset cases in the United States have been documnented. The infectivity of undocumented infectious population was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.21 - 0.70) of that of the documented infectious population, while that of the latent population was 0.19 (95% CI: 0.11 - 0.27) of that of the documented infectious population. The incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 10.69 days (95% CI: 10.02 - 11.74). We estimated that if the current control interventions are continued, the pandemic situation in the United States is likely to keep climbing up, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases is expected to reach more than 1.7 million in July and continue to grow. We also performed component analysis and sensitivity analysis, researching the compositions of the people with COVID-19, and considering that there is only a random time delay between the number of patients in the incubation period and the actual number of patients.

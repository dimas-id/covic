BACKGROUND Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), although which factors are associated with an improved overall survival (OS) remains unclear. The primary aim of this study is to determine to what extent a radiological response to (90)Y-DOTATOC/(90)Y-DOTATATE PRRT is associated with an improved OS. The association of biochemical and clinical response to OS were assessed as secondary outcome measures. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on 57 patients: radiological response was classified using RECIST criteria, biochemical response was classified using WHO criteria and clinical response was assessed subjectively. Responses were recorded as positive response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD), and survival analysed. RESULTS Radiological response was achieved in 71.5% (24.5% PR, 47% SD) and was associated with a greater OS (51 and 56 months, respectively), compared with PD (18 months). A biochemical or clinical response post PRRT were not associated with a statistically significant improvement in OS. However, when combined with radiological response a survival benefit was observed according to the number of outcomes (radiological, biochemical, clinical), in which a response was observed. Mild haematological toxicity was common, renal toxicity was rare. CONCLUSION In patients with progressive metastatic NETs receiving (90)Y-DOTATOC/(90)Y-DOTATATE PRRT, a radiological response with either a PR or a SD post therapy confers a significant OS benefit.

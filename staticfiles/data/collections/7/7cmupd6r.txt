Diagnosis of pulmonary disease is typically based upon consideration of presenting symptoms, physical examination, and pulmonary function testing in combination with classification of radiographic features, to guide diagnostic tests and initiate empiric treatment. When diagnostic efforts and/or empiric treatment fails, thoracic surgeons have traditionally been called upon to perform surgical biopsy of the lung to aid in the diagnosis of indeterminate, life-threatening pulmonary disease. Such biopsy has been requested specifically in the case of diffuse lung disease among patients receiving treatment for solid-organ or hematologic cancers, particularly when symptoms of respiratory failure progress and when noninvasive diagnostic tests and empiric treatments fail to halt progression. In such circumstances, radiologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons may be consulted and asked to provide tissue specimens that will allow rapid, accurate diagnosis leading to specific treatment. It is imperative that biopsy take place before respiratory failure supervenes [1], and that the specimens provided to clinical laboratories, pathologists, and microbiologists are comprehensive and properly preserved.

The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has involved tens of thousands of patients in numerous countries and the causative virus, SARS COV-2 is highly transmissible. Molecular diagnostic tools are central to containment of the virus and initiating proper clinical care. Rapidity, user-friendliness, and high degree of sensitivity and specificity are desirable features of diagnostic assays for screening purposes. Herein, we present a single step reverse transcriptase LAMP assay (RT-LAMP), which can detect up to 500 viral copies in 30 minutes. We challenged our assay with a large number of clinical samples collected from 47 confirmed cases and 213 negative patients. Our LAMP assay showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity compared to two commercialized qRT-PCR assay as gold standard. We present a rapid RT-LAMP assay that could extend the capacity of laboratories to process 2.5 more clinical samples relative to qRT-PCR and potentially could be used for high-throughput screening purposes.

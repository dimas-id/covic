PURPOSE This study aimed to evaluate adhesion formation, mesh contraction, and tissue response to an omega-3 fatty acid barrier-coated lightweight polypropylene mesh (C-Qur) after intra-abdominal placement, and compare these properties to those of other commercially available meshes. MATERIALS AND METHODS After randomization, 3 x 3 cm pieces of Atrium C-Qur, Mesh ProLite Ultra, Composix, Parietex, Proceed, Sepramesh, and DualMesh were sewn to the intact peritoneum on either side of a midline incision in 41 New Zealand white rabbits. Necropsy was performed at 120 days, and explants were evaluated for adhesion grade, adhesion amount, and mesh contraction. Histologic evaluation included extent of capsule formation, abdominal wall tissue ingrowth, degrees of inflammation and vascularization of the surrounding tissue, and the presence of mesothelialization. Results. There were no significant differences between the C-Qur mesh and the commercially available meshes tested with regard to adhesion grade or amount, although percentage adhesion coverage for the C-Qur mesh was much less than for Composix and Proceed. The C-Qur mesh contracted less than all meshes, significantly less (P < .05) than DualMesh or Proceed. DualMesh exhibited the greatest amount of capsule formation and inflammation on its parietal side as compared with the other meshes. CONCLUSIONS Placing lightweight polypropylene mesh with an omega-3 fatty acid barrier coating intraperitoneally results in more favorable adhesion characteristics compared with Composix and Proceed meshes at 120-day explantation after intraperitoneal placement. The minimal amount of contraction and favorable tissue response in comparison to other commercially available meshes makes C-Qur mesh a practical alternative for laparoscopic and open ventral hernia repair.

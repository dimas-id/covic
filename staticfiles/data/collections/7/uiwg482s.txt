Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is a recently identified disease of pigs linked to the emergence of a new porcine circovirus (PCV2). We report here the characterization of immunorelevant linear B-cell epitopes of the Open Reading Frame 2-encoded protein (Orf2) from PCV2 by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using experimental antisera collected from pigs inoculated with a PCV2 isolate. Two epitopes spanning residues 69 to 83 and 117 to 131 were specific to PCV2. Antibodies to the 117 to 131 epitope (B-133) were detected in 22% and 100% of specific pathogen-free (SPF) pig sera 6 and 11 weeks post inoculation, respectively. Cross-sectional studies performed with field sera collected from PMWS-affected herds showed B-133 antibodies in 5% of 8 to 10 week-old pigs, 38% of 13â€“14 week-old pigs, 62% of 16 to 19 week-old pigs, 56% of 20 to 25 week-old pigs and 45% of 26 to 31 week-old pigs. All these data suggest that epitope B-133 is a serological marker of PCV2 infection that could be used for the detection of PCV2 antibody response.

Respiratory rate is recognized as a clinically important parameter for monitoring respiratory status on the general care floor (GCF). Currently, intermittent manual assessment of respiratory rate is the standard of care on the GCF. This technique has several clinically-relevant shortcomings, including the following: (1) it is not a continuous measurement, (2) it is prone to observer error, and (3) it is inefficient for the clinical staff. We report here on an algorithm designed to meet clinical needs by providing respiratory rate through a standard pulse oximeter. Finger photoplethysmograms were collected from a cohort of 63 GCF patients monitored during free breathing over a 25-min period. These were processed using a novel in-house algorithm based on continuous wavelet-transform technology within an infrastructure incorporating confidence-based averaging and logical decision-making processes. The computed oximeter respiratory rates (RRoxi) were compared to an end-tidal CO2 reference rate (RRETCO2). RRETCO2 ranged from a lowest recorded value of 4.7 breaths per minute (brpm) to a highest value of 32.0 brpm. The mean respiratory rate was 16.3 brpm with standard deviation of 4.7 brpm. Excellent agreement was found between RRoxi and RRETCO2, with a mean difference of -0.48 brpm and standard deviation of 1.77 brpm. These data demonstrate that our novel respiratory rate algorithm is a potentially viable method of monitoring respiratory rate in GCF patients. This technology provides the means to facilitate continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, coupled with arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate, using a single non-invasive sensor in low acuity settings.

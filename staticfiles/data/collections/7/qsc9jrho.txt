Seasonal influenza viruses constitute a major global concern. Currently, H3N2 and H1N1pdm09 are the commonly circulating influenza A viruses. The haemagglutin and neuraminidase genes of influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Egyptian paediatric patients with respiratory distress were sequenced. Mutational analysis of all published sequences from Egypt was evolutionary tracked for both HA and NA genes. Phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 HA showed that the Egyptian strains belong to 3C2 subclade while Egyptian A(H1N1)pdm09 strains belong to 6B1 subclade. Some Egyptian A(H1N1)pdm09, 2013â€“2014, strains form a new subclade; 6B3. High score of mutations were recorded in HA of H1N1pdm09 but higher was recorded in H3N2 strains. These findings confirmed a high mutation rate of influenza A subtypes specially H3N2 strains.

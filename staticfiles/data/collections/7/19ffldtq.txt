We describe the first case of single-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy with intracorporeal suturing of the vault performed in Singapore. A 40-year-old woman with microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix successfully underwent single-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Unique articulated and multifunction laparoscopic instruments were used to complete the surgery in 118 minutes, with no complications. The patient had minimal pain postoperatively and recovered uneventfully within two weeks. This case illustrates the benefits of single-port access laparoscopic surgery in well-selected cases.

PURPOSE To investigate whether indium-111-labeled R1507 ((111)In-R1507) immuno-SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), a novel noninvasive, in vivo screening method to visualize membranous insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression and accessibility, can be used to predict IGF-1R treatment (R1507) response in bone sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with IGF-1R-expressing human bone sarcoma xenografts (OS-1, EW-5, and EW-8) which showed high, modest, or no response, respectively, to R1507, a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of IGF-1R. An IGF-1R-negative tumor (OS-33), unresponsive to IGF-1R inhibitors, was examined as well. Mice were injected with (111)In-R1507. Biodistribution and immuno-SPECT/computed tomography imaging studies were carried out 1, 3, and 7 days p.i. in mice with OS-1 and EW-5 xenografts and 3 days p.i. in mice with EW-8 and OS-33 xenografts. RESULTS Biodistribution studies showed specific accumulation of (111)In-R1507 in OS-1 and EW-5 xenografts (27.5 ± 6.5%ID/g and 14.0 ± 2.8%ID/g, 3 days p.i., respectively). Most importantly, (111)In-R1507 uptake in IGF-1R positive, but unresponsive, EW-8 xenografts (6.5 ± 1.5%ID/g, 3 days p.i.) was similar to that of the IGF-1R-negative OS-33 tumor (5.5 ± 0.6%ID/g, 3 days p.i.). Uptake in normal tissues was low and nonspecific. Corresponding immuno-SPECT images clearly discriminated between high, modest, and nonresponding tumors by showing a homogeneous (OS-1), heterogeneous (EW-5), or nonspecific (EW-8 and OS-33) tumor uptake of (111)In-R1507. CONCLUSIONS (111)In-R1507 immuno-SPECT is an excellent method to visualize membranous IGF-1R expression and target accessibility in vivo in human bone sarcoma xenografts and may serve as an independent marker to predict IGF-1R therapy (R1507) response in bone sarcoma patients.

• Hepatitis is defined as any inflammatory cell infiltrate within the hepatic parenchyma; the term cholangiohepatitis describes the extension of that inflammation to include the intrahepatic bile ducts. • Although many causes of hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis have been described in dogs and cats, the cause in many cases remains unknown. • A suspicion of hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis may be based on supportive historical, physical examination, and clinicopathologic findings that are similar for most causes of hepatic disease. A diagnosis of hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis is made ultimately via histopathologic evaluation of hepatic tissue. • The mechanisms of hepatocellular injury in animals with hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis are poorly understood. Elucidation of these mechanisms may provide the basis for future therapeutic options. • Successful treatment of the patient with hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis involves addressing the underlying disease or inciting cause and providing aggressive symptomatic therapy and supportive care.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) known as COVID-19 has emerged as a major threat to human existence. COVID-19 seems to have undergone adaptive evolution through an intermediate host, most likely bats. The flu leads to severe pneumonia that causes respiratory and multi-organ failure. The absence of any known treatment procedures, drugs, or vaccines has created panic around the World. The need is to develop rapid testing kits, drugs and vaccines. However, these proposals are time-consuming processes. At present social distancing along with previously known traditional medicines can act as quick and short-term alternatives for treating this viral flu.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is safe and efficacious for the management of achalasia cardia (AC). POEM is usually performed under general anesthesia in an endoscopy suite or operating theatre. The current study was conducted with the aim to analyse anesthetic management of patients with AC who underwent POEM at our institution. METHODS We retrospectively analysed the data of patients with AC who underwent POEM at our institution from January 2013 to September 2016. All cases were performed in an endoscopy suite under supervision of an anesthesia management team. Pre-procedure endoscopic evacuation of esophagogastric contents was done in all cases. Management strategies used for gas-related adverse events and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Four hundred and eighty patients (median age 40 years, range 4-77 years) underwent POEM during the study period. The sub-types of AC were type I (163), type II (297), and type III (20). POEM was successfully completed in 97.5% patients. Gas-related events were noted in 30.6% cases including-capno-thorax in 1%, capno-peritoneum in 12.3%, retroperitoneal air in 16.5%, capno-mediastinum in 0.2%, and capno-pericardium in 0.4% patients. Significant rise in end tidal CO2 (> 45) and peak airway pressure were observed in 8.1% and 5.4% cases, respectively. Drainage was required in 12.3% patients. There was no occurrence of aspiration during or after POEM. CONCLUSIONS POEM could be safely performed in an endoscopy suite under supervision of an expert anesthesia management team. Gas-related adverse events were common during POEM and could be managed with a standardized approach.

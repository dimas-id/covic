Abstract Infectious Bronchitis Virus, a member of the Coronaviridae, is a respiratory pathogen in poultry. We found that in vitro stimulation with IBV resulted in ChIFN-γ production in splenocytes of both infected birds and uninfected birds. The non-specific stimulation did not occur when other avian viruses or other coronaviruses were used or when mammalian cells were stimulated with IBV. Inactivation of IBV reduced ChIFN-γ production, but ChIFN-γ remained elevated compared to unstimulated cells. An increase in ChIFN-γ mRNA was detected in splenocytes from IBV-infected and uninfected chickens as early as 1 h after stimulation with IBV. These results indicate that IBV acts as a polyclonal stimulus, inducing a rapid production of IFN-γ even without previous exposure to the virus.

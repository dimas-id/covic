The interaction of host-cell nucleic acid-binding proteins with the genomes of positive-stranded RNA viruses is known to play a role in the translation and replication of many viruses. To date, however, the characterization of similar interactions with the genomes of members of the family Caliciviridae has been limited to in vitro binding analysis. In this study, Feline calicivirus (FCV) has been used as a model system to identify and characterize the role of host-cell factors that interact with the viral RNA. It was demonstrated that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts specifically with the 5' sequences of the FCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Using RNA interference it was shown that PTB is required for efficient FCV replication in a temperature-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTB resulted in a 15- to 100-fold reduction in virus titre, as well as a concomitant reduction in viral RNA and protein synthesis at 32 degrees C. In addition, virus-induced cytopathic effect was significantly delayed as a result of an siRNA-mediated reduction in PTB levels. A role for PTB in the calicivirus life cycle was more apparent at temperatures above and below 37 degrees C, fitting with the hypothesis that PTB functions as an RNA chaperone, potentially aiding the folding of RNA into functional structures. This is the first functional demonstration of a host-cell protein interacting with a calicivirus RNA.

Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an international public health emergency. The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new-onset fever or respiratory tract symptoms. However, these symptoms can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses. We reported a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza A virus coinfection. During the epidemic, the possibility of COVID-19 should be considered regardless of positive findings for other pathogens.

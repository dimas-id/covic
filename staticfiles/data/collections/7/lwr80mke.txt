This article recommends a 3-pronged system of Identify, Isolate, Inform to describe the actions necessary in the first few minutes of encountering a potential Ebola patient. Application of the "vital sign zero" triage concept of early recognition of potential threats coupled with this novel algorithm will optimize protection of health care workers and the public health while concurrently providing a safe method for individual patient care.

In conclusion, until the cellular biology of hepatitis B virus infection is understood and until the technology for the development of suitable virus infected autologous target cells is available, it will not be possible to definitively establish the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus induced hepatocellular injury. Clearly, considerable effort must now be focused on the basic biology of virus infection, replication, and effects on hepatocellular metabolism before it will be possible to perform the definitive experiments to elucidate the role played by the immune system in the pathogenesis of this disease.

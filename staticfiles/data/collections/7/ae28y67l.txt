In this chapter, I first discuss the need for an innovative approach to career counseling. A few examples of key life transitions are given. Several personality theories that have influenced the development of career counseling theory and practice are considered. Next, humanistic and related perspectives on human performance, development, choice-making, and execution that relate to counseling for self- and career construction and life design are covered. I also discuss different perspectives on the notion of “Active mastering of passive suffering”.

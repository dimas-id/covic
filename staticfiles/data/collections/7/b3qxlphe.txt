DNA branches out: Recent advances in the assembly of dendritic DNA structures enable applications in biosensing of pathogens and the generation of novel pads of DNA hydrogel biomaterials (see scheme, left). These pads are immersed in a cell extract containing RNA polymerase (red), ribosomes (yellow), and other components for in vitro protein biosynthesis, where they can be used as templates for cell‚Äêfree protein production.[Image: see text]

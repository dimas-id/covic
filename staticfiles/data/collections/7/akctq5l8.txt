The optimal head position for GlideScope facilitated nasotracheal intubation has not yet been determined. We compared the neutral and sniffing positions to establish the degree of intubation difficulty. A total of 88 ASA I-II patients requiring nasotracheal intubation for elective dental surgery with normal airways were divided into two groups according to head position, neutral position (group N), and sniffing position (group S). The primary outcome was the degree of intubation difficulty according to the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS): Easy (IDS = 0), mildly difficult (IDS = 1 to 4), and moderately to severely difficult (IDS â‰¥ 5). Eighty-seven patients completed the study and their data were analyzed. The degree of intubation difficulty was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.004). The frequency of difficult intubation (IDS > 0) was 12 (27.9%) in group N and 28 (63.6%) in group S (difference in proportion, 35.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.8 to 52.6%; p = 0.001). The neutral position facilitates nasotracheal intubation with GlideScope by aligning the nasotracheal tube and the glottis inlet more accurately than the sniffing position.

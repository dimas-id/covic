Miniaturized bio-diagnostic devices have the potential to allow for rapid pathogen screening in clinical patient samples, as a low cost and portable alternative to conventional bench-top equipment. Miniaturization of key bio-diagnostic techniques, such as: nucleic acid detection and quantification, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA fingerprinting, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), results in substantial reduction of reaction volumes (expensive samples/reagents) and shorter reaction times. Droplet microfluidics (DMF) is one of several miniaturized bio-sample handling techniques available for manipulating clinical samples and reagents in microliter (10(−6) L) to picoliter (10(−12) L) volume regime. Electro-actuation of sample and reagent in the form of droplets in the aforementioned volume regime, using dielectrophoresis (DEP) and/or Electrowetting (EW) are achieved by means of patterned, insulated metal electrodes on one or more substrates. In this work, we have utilized electro-actuation based DMF technology, integrated with suitably tailored resistive micro-heaters and temperature sensors, to achieve chip based real-time, quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). This qRT-PCR micro-device was utilized to detect and quantify the presence of influenza A and C virus nucleic acids, using in-vitro synthesized viral RNA segments. The experimental analysis of the DMF micro-device confirms its capabilities in qRT-PCR based detection and quantification of pathogen samples, with accuracy levels comparable to established commercial bench-top equipment (PCR efficiency ∼95%). The limit of detection (LOD) of the chip based qRT-PCR technique was estimated to be ∼5 copies of template RNA per PCR reaction.

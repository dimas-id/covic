The growing epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 challenges healthcare resources globally and mandates innovation. We describe our novel drive-through coronavirus testing which we used for testing of possible cases in the contain phase of UK response and are now using for healthcare worker testing. We found that this system was pragmatic, cost-efficient and favourable for patients. It is easily modifiable for use in future infectious disease outbreaks.

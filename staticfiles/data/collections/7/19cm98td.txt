BACKGROUND Currently, >200 meshes are commercially available in the United States. To help guide appropriate mesh selection, the investigators examined the postsurgical experiences of all patients undergoing ventral hernia repair at their facility from 2008 to 2011 with ≥12 months of follow-up. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted. All returns (surgical readmission, office or emergency visit) for complications or recurrences were examined. The impact of demographics (age, gender, and body mass index [BMI]), risk factors (hernia grade, hernia size, concurrent and past bariatric surgery, concurrent and past organ transplantation, any concurrent surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score), and prosthetic type (polypropylene, other synthetic, human acellular dermal matrix, non-cross-linked porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix, other biologic, or none) on the frequency of return was evaluated. RESULTS A total of 564 patients had 12 months of follow-up, and 417 patients had 18 months of follow-up. In a univariate regression analysis, study arm (biologic, synthetic, or primary repair), hernia grade, hernia size, past bariatric surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score were significant predictors of recurrence (P < .05). Multivariate analysis, stepwise regression, and interaction tests identified three variables with significant predictive power: hernia grade, hernia size, and BMI. The adjusted odds ratios vs hernia grade 2 for surgical readmission were 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 5.1) for grade 3 and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 6.4) for grade 4 at 12 months and 2.3 (95% CI, 1.1 to 4.6) for grade 3 and 4.2 (95% CI, 1.7 to 10.0) for grade 4 at 18 months. Large hernia size (adjusted odds ratio vs small size, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and higher BMI (adjusted odds ratio for BMI ≥50 vs 30 to 34.99 kg/m(2), 5.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 26.2) increased the likelihood of surgical readmission within 12 months. CONCLUSIONS The present data support the hypothesis that careful matching of patient characteristics to choice of prosthetic will minimize complications, readmissions, and the number of postoperative office visits.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS After sacrocolpopexy, intra-abdominal pelvic abscesses are often managed with intravenous antibiotics, excision of the mesh involved, and debridement of compromised tissue. METHODS AND RESULTS Three cases of successful management of pelvic abscesses after sacrocolpopexy using long-term antibiotics and percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses without removing the mesh are presented. CONCLUSIONS In selected patients who have undergone sacrocolpopexy, with careful counseling, conservative management of pelvic abscesses with percutaneous drainage and long-term antibiotic treatment without the surgical excision of the mesh may play a role.

Abstract The extensive use of negative staining techniques and electron microscopy in diagnostic centers has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of reported viral enteric infections in man and animals in the last 10 yr. Enteric infection due to adenoviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, parvoviruses, picornaviruses (caliciviruses), rotaviruses as well as some unidentified viral particles are described. The brief literature review on each of these virus families is supplemented with clinical cases submitted to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. Comparative aspects of viral infections between different animal species as well as man are discussed wherever possible.

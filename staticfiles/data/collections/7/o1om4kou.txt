Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) infections are ubiquitous in mammals. Increasing evidence suggests that some MRVs can cause severe respiratory disease and encephalitis in humans and other animals. Previously, we isolated six bat MRV strains. However, the pathogenicity of these bat viruses remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the host range and pathogenicity of 3 bat MRV strains (WIV2, 3 and 7) which represent three serotypes. Our results showed that all of them can infect cell lines from different mammalian species and displayed different replication efficiency. The BALB/c mice infected by bat MRVs showed clinical symptoms with systematic infection especially in lung and intestines. Obvious tissue damage were found in all infected lungs. One of the strains, WIV7, showed higher replication efficiency in vitro and vivo and more severe pathogenesis in mice. Our results provide new evidence showing potential pathogenicity of bat MRVs in animals and probable risk in humans.

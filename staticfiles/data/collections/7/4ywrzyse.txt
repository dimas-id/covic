The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is an emerging pathogen that continues to cause outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula and in travelers from this region, raising the concern that a global pandemic could occur. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the first 725 amino acids (S1) of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein induces antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. With three immunizations, high titers of neutralizing antibodies (up to 1: 10(4)) were generated without adjuvant. DNA vaccination with the MERS-CoV S1 gene markedly increased the frequencies of antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells secreting IFN-Î³ and other cytokines. Both pcDNA3.1-S1 DNA vaccine immunization and passive transfer of immune serum from pcDNA3.1-S1 vaccinated mice protected Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice from MERS-CoV challenge. These results demonstrate that a DNA vaccine encoding MERS-CoV S1 protein induces strong protective immune responses against MERS-CoV infection.

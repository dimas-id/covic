This study complements extant variable-centered research that focus on the relationship between perfectionism and the autonomous and controlled motivation to exercise. A person-centered approach is used for identifying perfectionism profiles as well as analyzing inter-profile differences in terms of the six regulatory styles located on the autonomy-control continuum. A sample of 597 (M(age) = 22.08, SD = 3.33) Ecuadorian undergraduates enrolled in a sport science degree program was employed. Latent Profile Analysis based on two higher-order perfectionism dimensions, Perfectionistic Strivings (PS) and Perfectionistic Concerns (PC), supported a four-class solution: Non-Perfectionists (low PS and PC), Adaptive Perfectionists (high PS and low PC), Maladaptive Perfectionists (high PS and PC), and Moderate Perfectionists (moderate PS and PC). Adaptive Perfectionists obtained the highest means on Intrinsic, Integrated, and Identified regulations. However, these differences where only significant when compared with Moderate Perfectionists, and only in the case of Integrated regulation, in comparison with Non-Perfectionists. In contrast, Maladaptive Perfectionists obtained significantly higher scores on Introjected and External regulations as well as on Amotivation than the other three classes. Results are discussed in light of Self-Determination Theory.

Surgeons are increasingly being faced with the challenge of treating elderly patients with colon cancer. The present study therefore aimed to compare the short-term outcomes of single-port laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for elderly patients with colon cancer (≥70 years) with those in younger patients (41-69 years; control group). Among 100 patients with colorectal cancer who had been treated with single-port laparoscopic surgery between January 2011 and December 2014, 56 (56.0%) were ≥70 years of age. The results of treatment and short-term outcomes in the elderly group (n=56) were retrospectively compared with the younger patients in the control group (n=44). The sex distribution, body mass index, history of prior surgery and the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification were similar between the groups. Onodera's prognostic nutritional index demonstrated significant differences between the elderly and control groups (38.3 vs. 49.8; P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the mean length of surgery (219.5±73.5 vs. 201.4±76.5 min; P=0.43), estimated blood loss (32.2±74.5 vs. 36.1±90.2 ml; P=0.10), postoperative complications (10.9 vs. 7.1%; P=0.78), length of postoperative hospital stay (9.6±12.5 vs. 7.3±3.0 days; P=0.23) or number of harvested lymph nodes (21.8±24.3 vs. 22.5±11.3; P=0.87) between the elderly and control groups. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrate that SILS may be carried out feasibly in elderly patients with colon cancer.

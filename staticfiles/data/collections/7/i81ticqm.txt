Reduced-port thoracoscopic surgery for pneumothorax has been well reported. However, the optimum method for preventing postoperative recurrence in reduced-port thoracoscopic bullectomy remains unclear. We investigated ways to improve the covering technique with reduced-port thoracoscopic bullectomy for spontaneous pneumothorax. From April to December 2016, we performed a simple covering technique with reduced-port thoracoscopic bullectomy on six patients and evaluated the surgical results and patient outcomes. All of the patients were successfully treated with the simple covering technique, and none had a postoperative ipsilateral recurrence of pneumothorax. Our method is a simple and easy technique involving the wide reinforcement of the staple line and may be effective in reducing the risk of postoperative recurrence in reduced-port thoracoscopic bullectomy.

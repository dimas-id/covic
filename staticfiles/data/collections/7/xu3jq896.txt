The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) recognises the important contribution that nursing students are making to the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article reports on the Greater Manchester Supervision and Delegation Framework, providing practical guidance for students and practice staff (practice supervisor/practice assessor and registered nurse) on how to support student nurses who have opted into a paid (deployed) healthcare role. The framework operationalises NMC emergency standards for Nursing and Midwifery education, enabling students to complete their pre-registration undergraduate or postgraduate nursing programme while also supporting the healthcare workforce (NMC, 2020).

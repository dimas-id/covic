Microarray techniques play an important role for testing some reactions of diseases which are caused by viruses. Probes in microarray are one kind of the most important materials. Usually, scientists use a unique probe for marking a special target sequence. Thus, for identifying n different viruses, we need n different probes. Recently, some researchers study non-unique probes to identify viruses by using less number of probes. In this case, a virus can be identified by a combination of some probes. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of probes that can identify all the given targets. We consider the k-fault tolerance selection of probes. That is, if any k probes fail, then we still can identify each target. We propose a practical algorithm for this k-fault tolerance probe selection problem. Some experiments are studied on SARS, H5N1, and so on.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) arises from the virus SARS-CoV-2 which is similar to the original SARS virus. The most common symptoms of the COVID-19 infection are fever, coughing and shortness of breath. According to the current data, the primary mode of transmission for the COVID-19 virus is between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. The virus may lead to worse respiratory complications, including pneumonia, especially in older patients and patients with pre-existing illnesses, such as cancer. Cancer patients are at a significantly higher risk of getting infected with COVID-19 since their immune system can be compromised and that reality has to do with both that they have cancer and that they are on therapy for their cancer. COVID-19 crisis has impacted every aspect of the practice, including outpatient, elective, wards, emergency care, conferences, teaching and research. We should make sure cancer patients on active treatment are treated appropriately. In this review, we tried to explain how to prevent the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients.

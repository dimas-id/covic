PURPOSE Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is a minimally invasive surgery that is growing rapidly among surgical procedures. However, there is no standard method for SILC. Therefore, we evaluated the adequacy and feasibility of SILC using Konyang Standard Method. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our series of 307 SILCs performed between April 2010 and August 2012. Initially we excluded the patients who were more than 70 years old, had cardiologic or pulmonologic problems and complications of acute cholecystitis. After 50 cases, we did not apply the exclusion criteria. We performed SILC by Konyang Standard Method using three-trocar single port (hand-made) and long articulated instruments. RESULTS Three hundred and seven patients underwent SILC. Male were 131 patients and female were 176 patients. Mean age was 51.6 ± 13.7 years old and mean body mass index was 24.8 ± 3.6 kg/m(2). Ninety-three patients had histories of previous abdominal operation. Patient's pathologies included: chronic cholecystitis (247 cases), acute cholecystitis (30 cases), gall bladder (GB) polyps (24 cases), and GB empyema (6 cases). Mean operating time was 53.1 ± 25.4 minutes and mean hospital stay was 2.9 ± 3.4 days. There were four cases of 3-4 ports conversion due to cystic artery bleeding. Complications occurred in 5 cases including wound infection (2 cases), bile duct injury (1 case), duodenal perforation (1 case), and umbilical hernia (1 case). CONCLUSION SILC using Konyang Standard Method is safe and feasible. Therefore, our standard procedure can be applied to almost all benign GB disease.

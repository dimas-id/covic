At the beginning of 2020, the national health system and medical communities are faced with unprecedented public health challenges. A novel strain of coronavirus, later identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread globally, marking another pandemic of coronaviruses. This viral disease is responsible for devastating pneumonia, named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and projected to persist until the end of the year. In tropical countries, however, concerns arise regarding the similarities of COVID-19 with other infectious diseases due to the same chief complaint, which is fever. One of the infectious disease of a primary concern is dengue infection, which its peak season is approaching. Others report that there are cases of serological cross-reaction of COVID-19 and dengue infection. In this comprehensive review, we underscore the importance of knowing similar clinical presentations of both diseases and emphasize why excluding COVID-19 in the differentials in the setting of a pandemic is imprudent.

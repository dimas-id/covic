This article describes a novel splinting technique for the temporizing management of pediatric femur fractures. The J-splint is a reliable, simple, and rapidly applied splint that prevents many of the complications and pitfalls of other described temporizing measures, such as skeletal traction, skin traction, traction splinting, and posterior splinting. This technique of J-splinting femur fractures has low morbidity and provides many advantages in the temporizing management of pediatric femur fractures.

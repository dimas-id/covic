CONICET's Translational Health Research Network is coordinating efforts to advance in translational medicine. Health researchers initiate and focus their research with the aim of improving the health and quality of life of the population. An efficient research system should address health problems relevant to the population resulting in interventions and outcomes important for patients and health professionals. Recommendations to achieve this involve large thematic areas like (a) to set research priorities; (b) to improve research methodology; (c) to make research management and regulation transparent; (d) to increase accessibility to all results; and (e) to improve research dissemination. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has been a clear demonstration of how the country's research system has united the most diverse disciplines to jointly provide solutions to address it. An active and transparent mechanism to identify priorities in the country and to unite funding and research efforts to provide solutions to those priorities is proposed. Translational health research means the joint work of the most diverse health research disciplines in order to jointly obtain efficient and effective interventions to improve the health and quality of life of the population.

Abstract The ever increasing resistance of human pathogens to current anti-infective agents is a serious medical problem, leading to the need to develop novel antibiotic prototype molecules. In the case of viruses, the search for antiviral agents involves additional difficulties, particularly due to the nature of the infectious viral agents. Thus, many compounds that may cause the death of viruses are also very likely to injure the host cell that harbours them. Natural products are increasingly appreciated as leads for drug discovery and development. Screening studies have been carried out in order to find antiviral agents from natural sources, and the occurrence of antiviral activity in extracts of plants, marine organisms and fungi is frequent. The evidence indicates that there may be numerous potentially useful antiviral phytochemicals in nature, waiting to be evaluated and exploited. In addition, other plants, not previously utilized medicinally, may also reveal antivirals. Among natural antiviral agents, recent investigations have reconsidered the interest of phyto-polysaccharides, which act as potent inhibitors of different viruses. This chapter will illustrate a variety of antiviral polysaccharides from natural sources since 1990, with the aim of making this matter more accessible to drug development

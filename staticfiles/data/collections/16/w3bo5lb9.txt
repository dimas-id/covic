BACKGROUND: Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) are modes of non-invasive respiratory support commonly used after extubation in extremely preterm infants. However, the cardiorespiratory physiology of these infants on each mode is unknown. METHODS: Prospective, randomized crossover study in infants with birth weight â‰¤1250 g undergoing their first extubation attempt. NCPAP and HFNC were applied randomly for 45 min each, while ribcage and abdominal movements, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) were recorded. Respiratory signals were analyzed using an automated method, and differences between NCPAP and HFNC features and changes in FiO(2) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 30 infants with median [interquartile range] gestational age of 27 weeks [25.7, 27.9] and birth weight of 930 g [780, 1090] were studied. Infants were extubated at 5 days [2, 13] of life with 973 g [880, 1170] and three failed (10%). No differences in cardiorespiratory behavior were noted, except for longer respiratory pauses (9.2 s [5.0, 11.5] vs. 7.3 s [4.6, 9.3]; p = 0.04) and higher FiO(2) levels (p = 0.02) during HFNC compared to NCPAP. CONCLUSIONS: In extremely preterm infants studied shortly after extubation, the use of HFNC was associated with longer respiratory pauses and higher FiO(2) requirements.

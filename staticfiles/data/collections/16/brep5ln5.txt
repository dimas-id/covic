BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented worldwide public health crisis that requires new approaches. COVIDApp is a mobile application for the management of institutionalized individuals in long-term care facilities (LTCF). OBJECTIVE: Report the use of this innovative tool for the management of LTCF residents as a high-risk population, specifically for the early identification and self-isolation of suspected cases, the remote monitoring of mild cases and the real-time monitoring of the progression of the infection. METHODS: COVIDApp was implemented in 196 care centers in collaboration with 64 primary care teams. Objectives: early detection; self-isolation of suspected cases and rapid diagnosis; remote treatment and monitoring of mild cases; and real-time monitoring of the progression of the infection. The following parameters of COVID-19 were reported daily: signs/symptoms; diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction; absence of symptoms for &#8805;14 days; total deaths; and healthcare workers isolated with suspected COVID-19. The number of centers at risk was also described. RESULTS: Data were recorded from &#8805;10,000 institutionalized individuals and up to 4,000 healthcare workers between April 1st and 30th, 2020. A rapid increase in suspected cases was seen until day 6 but decreased during the 2 last weeks (from 1,084 to 282 cases). Confirmed cases increased from 419 cases (day 6) to 1,293 cases (day 22), remaining stable during the last week. Around 50% remained asymptomatic &#8805;14 days. A total of 854 (8%) deaths were reported (383 in suspected/confirmed cases). The number of isolated healthcare workers remained high over the 30 days; suspected cases decreased during the last 2 weeks. The number of high-risk LTCF decreased from 9.5% to 1.5%. CONCLUSIONS: COVIDApp could help clinicians to rapidly detect and remotely monitor suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 among institutionalized individuals, thus limiting the risk of spreading the virus. The platform shows the progression of infection in real time and can help us to design new strategies.

Background: Novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide. As recent radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data, the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is, 100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%, respectively.

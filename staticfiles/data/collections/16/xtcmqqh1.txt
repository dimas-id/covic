PURPOSE Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is an increasingly accepted treatment for nonsurgical candidates with a limited number of colorectal hepatic metastases. RF ablation is most effective in tumors smaller than 4.0 cm. This report describes 5-year survival in patients with single tumors with a maximum diameter of 4 cm. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty of 291 patients (14%; 24 men, 16 women; mean age, 67 years; age range, 34-86 y) with no or treated extrahepatic disease were identified who were not candidates for resection and who had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Sixteen had undergone hepatic resection and two had undergone lung resection and lung ablation. Thirty-two (80%) received chemotherapy. Thirty-five were treated under general anesthesia and five under conscious sedation. Our standard ablation protocol used internally water-cooled electrodes introduced percutaneously with ultrasonography and computed tomography guidance and monitoring. Follow-up data were obtained from primary care physicians or oncologists. RESULTS Mean tumor diameter was 2.3 cm (range, 0.8-4.0 cm). There were two successfully treated systemic complications: a chest infection and an exacerbation of asthma. There were no local complications. Mean follow-up was 38 months (range, 6-132 months). The median survival duration and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 59 months and 97%, 84%, 40%, respectively, after ablation; and 63 months, 100%, 88%, and 54%, respectively, from the diagnosis of liver metastases. History of liver resection did not impact survival. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation of solitary liver metastases 4 cm or smaller can be performed with minimal morbidity and results in excellent long-term survival, approaching that of surgical resection, even in patients who are not surgical candidates.

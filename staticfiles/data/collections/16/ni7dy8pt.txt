This study reports the sequence analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from infected individuals within the Greater Geelong region, Victoria, Australia. All but one individual had recently returned from travelling abroad, and all had clinical signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 belonging to three lineages were detected and represent separate introductions of the virus into the region. Sequence data were consistent with the recent travel history of each case. Full virus genome sequencing can play an important role in supporting local epidemiological tracing and monitoring for community transmission. Quality of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained was highly dependent on appropriate sample collection and handling.

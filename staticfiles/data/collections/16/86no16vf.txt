BACKGROUND Preliminary results showed some benefits of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) over conventional laparoscopic colectomy, including better cosmesis, less postoperative pain, and faster recovery, but these results need further confirmation. In addition, the literature still lacks comparative studies between the two approaches to prove the above-mentioned advantages of SILS over conventional laparoscopy and, most importantly, its equivalent effectiveness in terms of initial oncological results. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two consecutive series of 10 patients undergoing three-port conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (3PCL-RH) and single-incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, respectively, were compared in their short-term surgical and oncological outcomes. RESULTS Analysis of perioperative and postoperative outcomes revealed no significant differences between the two groups. In the SILS group an anastomotic leakage occurred, which was conservatively treated by continuous drainage, total parental nutrition, and antibiotic therapy. The analysis of oncological outcomes showed no differences in terms of length of distal tumor-free margin and harvest of lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS Despite its feasibility for right hemicolectomy and its equivalent short-term surgical and oncological outcome compared with conventional laparoscopy, SILS demonstrated no significant advantages in terms of surgical incision length and postoperative course compared with 3PCL-RH. We acknowledge that the small sample size and the nonrandomized design are a limit of the study. Thus, prospective randomized controlled trials are recommended to prove the superiority of single-incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.

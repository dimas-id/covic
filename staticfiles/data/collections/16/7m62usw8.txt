Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists trained as virologists can play critical roles in public health, such as in health science policy, epidemiology, and national defense. Despite a need for basic science backgrounds within these fields, finding entry-level careers can be challenging. Volunteer opportunities are a great way for scientists to experience public health careers while still in school, and this article describes volunteering with the Medical Reserve Corps and outlines unique postgraduate opportunities for early-career virologists.

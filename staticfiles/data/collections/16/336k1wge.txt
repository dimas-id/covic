BACKGROUND Middle meningeal arteriovenous fistulas (MMAVFs) are rare lesions with a poorly established natural history. We report our experience with patients with MMAVFs who presented with intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively maintained endovascular database for patients with MMAVFs, who were treated by embolization during a 15-year period. Hospital and outpatient medical records and imaging studies were reviewed. RESULTS Nine patients with MMAVFs, who presented with intracranial hemorrhage, underwent embolization (mean age 60.3 years, range 21-76; four male and five female). Four patients presented after trauma and five after spontaneous hemorrhage. All nine patients were angiographically cured after embolization of the fistula with liquid embolic agents (n = 8) or coils (n = 1). There were no procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION MMAVFs represent a rarely reported class of vascular lesions. They are typically associated with trauma, but also develop spontaneously, and may be associated with intracranial hemorrhage, which warrants classification of these lesions as high risk. Endovascular treatment is safe and effective and should be considered for these patients, particularly for those who have lesions with intracranial venous drainage.

INTRODUCTION To evaluate the feasibility and safety of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) for uncomplicated gallbladder in elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 810 patients undergoing SILC from May 2009 to October 2016 at Osaka Police Hospital was performed, and the outcomes of the patients aged < 80 years and the patients ≥ 80 years were compared. RESULTS The median operative times of patients <80 years and patients ≥80 years were 100 min and 110 min, respectively (p = 0.4). The conversion rates to a different operative procedure (multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy or open cholecystectomy) were 3% (22/763) of patients < 80 years and 0% of patients ≥ 80 years (p = 0.6). Perioperative complications were seen in 6% (46/763) of patients < 80 years and 17% (8/47) of patients ≥ 80 years (p < 0.05). Pneumonia was seen in 0% (0/763) of patients < 80 years and 4% (3/47) of patients ≥ 80 years (p < 0.05). There was no mortality in either group. The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days for patients <80 years and 5 days for patients ≥80 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION SILC for uncomplicated gallbladder could be performed for patients ≥ 80 years with acceptable morbidity and mortality as compared with the previous reports, though the complication rate of patients ≥ 80 years was higher than that of patients < 80 years.

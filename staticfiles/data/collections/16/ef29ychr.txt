Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) causes acute, self-limited respiratory infections. A close relationship between bovine coronaviruses (BCoVs) and HCoV-OC43 has recently been demonstrated. This study includes seven clinical, non-cell culture-adapted, contemporary HCoV-OC43 strains detected in France in 2003. By using RT-PCR and clonal sequencing of the S1 gene of HCoV-OC43, the inter-variant heterogeneity of the HCoV-OC43 circulating strains was studied and the intra-variant diversity was assessed by investigation of a quasispecies cloud. This paper brings to the forefront a high genetic diversity of circulating HCoV-OC43 variants. Genetically different groups are defined among the variants described in this study. One of these variants holds characteristics of an outlier and presents a deletion of 12 nt, also found in BCoV strains. Moreover, the presence of HCoV-OC43 as a quasispecies cloud in vivo during an acute respiratory-tract illness was discovered. It has also been revealed that quasispecies-cloud sizes are similar for the two viral populations tested.

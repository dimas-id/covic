The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which presumably started in China at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic, affects all segments of the health care system worldwide, including Hungary. As healthcare staff can come into contact with viral infections during many healthcare services, it is essential during the epidemic that Hungarian professionals working in various fields receive up-to-date information about the virus and the aspects of the infection that affect patient care and proposed measures. The present paper is a literature review in which the authors have elaborated on the currently available, relevant references, keeping in mind the epidemiological implications of clinical care. Based on the processed publications, it can be stated that during the interventions primarily affecting the head and neck region, especially in the case of interventions requiring the use of a rotating device, it is essential to fully protect all staff in the room with disposable full clothing, goggles and special masks. Replacement of this equipment and cleaning of the surgery should be done after each intervention and the entire supply team should be prepared for this in advance with training. Strict adherence to occupational health and infection control measures is essential to prevent cross-infections during treatment and infections by professionals. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161 (17): 660-666.

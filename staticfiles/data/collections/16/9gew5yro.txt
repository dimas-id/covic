PURPOSE OF REVIEW Misperception of children's weight status is prevalent among parents and children themselves and may impact parents' and children's health behaviors. This study was conducted in order to provide a descriptive systematic review of research on factors influencing parents' and children's misperceptions of children's weight status published in the past 5 years. RECENT FINDINGS Factors studied most often in relation to parents' and children's misperception included children's weight status, gender, and age, as well as parents' weight status, parental education levels and socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Most determinants that were found to have a significant influence on misperception in parents also did in children. The literature on misperception of children's weight status is extensive. Most determinants assessed in included studies were known determinants of childhood obesity. Further research should be directed toward better understanding the impact of weight status perception (whether it is accurate or not) on health behaviors and weight gain over time.

SARS‐CoV‐2 has been hypothesized as the aetiologic agent of CLL, on the basis of the temporal correlation between the “burst” of skin manifestations and the viral pandemic, even though we have scarce evidence of swab‐confirmed infections. Authors have therefore suggested some pathogenetic mechanisms such as a delayed immune‐mediated reaction to the virus in genetically‐predisposed patients(1) or an early IFN‐I response in young patients, muting early viral replication but also inducing microangiopathic changes.

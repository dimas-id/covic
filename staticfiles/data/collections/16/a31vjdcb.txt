Perioperative hemorrhage, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy are common in the surgical intensive care unit. As a result, blood product transfusion occurs frequently. While red blood cell, plasma, and platelet transfusions have a lifesaving role in the resuscitation of patients with trauma and hemorrhagic shock, their application in other settings is under scrutiny. Current data would suggest a conservative approach be taken, thus avoiding unnecessary transfusion and associated potential adverse events. New and developmental products such as prothrombin complex concentrates offer appealing alternatives to traditional transfusion practice—potentially with fewer risks—however, further investigation into their safety and efficacy is required before practice change can take place.

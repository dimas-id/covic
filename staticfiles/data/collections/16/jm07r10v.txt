OBJECTIVES Vasectomy is a popular and effective male surgical contraceptive method. Different techniques have been proposed to reduce failure rates and complications. In this study, we sought to compare vas deferens occlusion rates using both standard occlusion techniques and LigaSure (LSVS) for vasectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of nine patients underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy at our institution. During the procedure, a total of 125 fresh vas deferens samples were obtained and divided into four groups as follows: Group 1: ligation (n = 22), Group 2; ligation and electrocauterization (n = 18), Group 3; 5 mm LSVS (n = 44), Group 4; 10 mm LSVS (n = 41). All specimens were harvested during surgery and subsequent histopathological assessments were performed to assess the luminal status of the vas deferens. RESULTS Histopathological evaluation revealed that the majority of vas lumens with LSVS (79.5% of Group 3 and 89.4% of Group 4) were totally occluded. With standard techniques, however, the majority of vas lumens (86.4 and 77.8% of Groups 1 and 2, respectively) maintained a tiny patency. CONCLUSIONS On histopathological review, the application of LSVS resulted in better occlusion rates, compared to standard ligation methods. These findings suggest a higher occlusive role for LSVS for vasectomy. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of this technique.

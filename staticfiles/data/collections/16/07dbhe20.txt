Inherited heart disease represent a very heterogenous group of cardiac disorders, characterized by inherited, acquired, and often rare disorders affecting the heart muscle (cardiomyopathies) or the cardiac electrical system (ion channel disease). They are often familial diseases, and are among the leading cause of juvenile sudden death and heart failure. The aim of this paper is to give a perspective on how to run a clinical service during an epidemic or pandemic emergency and to describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks for patients affected by inherited heart diseases.

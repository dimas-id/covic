ABSTRACT Safeguarding the health and promoting the wellbeing and quality of life of the most vulnerable and fragile citizens is a top priority for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, numerous regulatory policies and 1135 waivers of federal requirements have been implemented by CMS to give long‐term care providers and professionals flexibilities to meet to the demands of resident and patient care needs during this public health emergency. Goals for these policies and waivers include to increase capacity, enhance workforce and capability, improve oversight and transparency, prevent COVID‐19 transmission and reduce provider burden.

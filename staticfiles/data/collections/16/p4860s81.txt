INTRODUCTION Cholecystoenteric fistula (CEF) is rare in biliary tract surgery, and cholecystogastric fistula (CGF) is the rarest form of CEF. Although open cholecystectomy with the closure of the fistula is the gold standard treatment for nonobstructing biliary-enteric fistulas, the optimal treatment for CGF has not been established. Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS), a minimally invasive surgery for gastric submucosal tumors, reportedly helps achieve favorable postoperative outcomes. This report presents a case wherein CGF was treated with LECS. CASE PRESENTATION An-84-year-old man with a history of chemotherapy for ileocecal diffuse large B cell lymphoma presented with fever and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with cholangitis, and endoscopic lithotripsy was performed. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall thickening close to the gallbladder, indicating a malignant lymphoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a concavity on the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach. Direct endoscopic cholangiography, which was performed by the injection of a contrast medium into the concavity, confirmed the concavity to be a CGF. Cholecystectomy with the closure of the fistula using the LECS was performed to check for suture line leakage and the positional relation of the suture line and the pylorus. The resected specimen showed acute and chronic cholecystitis without malignancy. The patient did not experience postoperative complications in the subsequent 3 months. DISCUSSION Resection and closure of the fistula using LECS were performed successfully. CONCLUSION LECS can be performed for CGF. LECS enables intraoperative observation of the fistula and suture line, and thus reduces postoperative complications.

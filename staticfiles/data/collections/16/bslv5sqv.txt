Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to report the clinical evaluation of a 3D-printed protective face shield designed to protect interventional radiologists from droplet transmission of the SARS-Cov-2. Materials and methods: A protective face shield consisting in a standard transparent polymerizing vinyl chloride (PVC) sheet was built using commercially available 3D printers. The 3D-printed face shield was evaluated in 31 interventional procedures in terms of ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual, quality of visual comfort and tolerance using a Likert scale (from 1, as very good to 5, as extremely poor). Results: The mean rating for ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual was 1.7 ± 0.8 (SD) (range: 1 - 4). The mean visual tolerance rating was 1.6 ± 0.7 (SD) (range: 1 - 4). The mean tolerability rating was 1.4 ± 0.7 (SD) (range: 1 - 3). Conclusion: The 3D-printed protective face shield is well accepted in various interventions. It may become an additional option for protection of interventional radiologists.

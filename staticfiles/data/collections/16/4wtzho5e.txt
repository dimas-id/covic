Saffold cardiovirus (SAFV), first identified in a stool sample in 2007, is thought to be associated with respiratory disease and gastroenteritis. On the other hand, animal experiments suggested that the major viral load, following intraperitoneal inoculation of SAFV in mice, may be detected in the pancreas. However, until now, no cases of SAFV in patients with pancreatitis have been reported. This report presents a unique case in a patient who developed relapsing acute pancreatitis (AP) after hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was suspected to have SAFV-1 infection. A 2-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital because of severe abdominal pain. His serum amylase and lipase levels were elevated. Enhanced computed tomography showed pancreatic swelling and dilation of the main pancreatic duct, leading to a diagnosis of severe AP. The viral genome of SAFV-1 was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from fecal samples. Furthermore, the serum neutralization titer for SAFV was elevated during AP, but decreased after 1 year. These findings strongly suggest the patient developed SAFV-1 infection concurrent with AP. Therefore, we propose that a cohort study is required to clarify the relationship between SAFV and AP.

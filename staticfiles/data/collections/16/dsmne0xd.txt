Abstract Progressive immune-associated injury is a hallmark of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Viral evasion of innate immunity, hypercytokinemia and systemic immunopathology in the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) infected host have been suggested as possible mechanisms for the cause of severe pathology and morbidity in SARS patients. The molecular and cellular basis for how SARS CoV impacts the host immune system resulting in severe SARS, however, has not been elucidated. The variable clinical course of SARS may be the result of complex programs of host responses against the infectious agent. Therefore, the systematic analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV is imperative in building as complete an immunological model as possible of host immunity and inflammatory responses during illness. Here we review recent advances in SARS immunopathogenesis research and present a summary of our findings regarding host responses in SARS patients. We contend that dysregulated type I and II interferon (IFN) responses during SARS may culminate in a failure of the switch from hyper-innate immunity to protective adaptive immune responses in the human host.

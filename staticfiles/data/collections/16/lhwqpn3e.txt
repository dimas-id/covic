The rapid innovation of information and communication technology (ICT) within the last decades has come along with the development of new opportunities and challenges, new business models, new systems, etc. Companies like Amazon, Google or Alibaba shape business functions and percolate our daily life. Business operations go hand in hand with new types of user experiences when buying goes different than just traditional ways. Often it is not only the buying behavior but also the way recommendations are perceived as they may be readily available. This relates to opinion mining and, unfortunately, opinion spamming. We survey the issue of opinion spamming and fake review detection and focus on both sides of fake review groups, i.e., how to detect such groups but also how to set up a group that might be undetected with current methods. As both directions go hand in hand we elaborate on learning in both directions with the aim to improve related methods.

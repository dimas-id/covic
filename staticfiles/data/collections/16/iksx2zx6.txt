PURPOSE This study investigates the effects of (111)In-oxine incorporation on human mesenchymal stem cells' (hMSC) biology and viability, and the applicability of (111)In-oxine for single-photon emission computed tomography/X-ray computed tomography (SPECT/CT) monitoring of hMSC in vivo. PROCEDURES HMSC were labelled with 10 Bq/cell. Cellular retention of radioactivity, cell survival, and migration were evaluated over 48 h. Metabolic activity was assessed over 14 days and the hMSC's stem cell character was evaluated. Serial SPECT/CT was performed after intra-osseous injection to athymic rats over 48 h. RESULTS Labelling efficiency was 25%, with 61% of incorporated (111)In remaining in the hMSC at 48 h. The radiolabelling was without effect on cell viability, stem cell character, and plasticity, whereas metabolic activity and migration were significantly reduced. Grafted cells could be imaged in situ with SPECT/CT. CONCLUSIONS (111)In-oxine labelling moderately impaired hMSC's functional integrity while preserving their stem cell character. Combined SPECT/CT imaging of (111)In-oxine-labelled hMSC opens the possibility for non-invasive sequential monitoring of therapeutic stem cells.

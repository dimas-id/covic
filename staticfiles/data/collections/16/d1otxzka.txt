As communities struggle to adapt to life under the threat of the global pandemic, COVID-19, those living with Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) must adapt with additional difficulties. Social distancing and shelter-in-place strategies have been implemented, resulting in fewer supermarkets trips, stockpile-purchasing behaviors in up to 74.5% of those surveyed(1), and shortages of staple food items all with potential impact on the availability of foods for those on limited diets. Concern about allergic reactions make exploring alternative or new ingredients undesirable or untenable. Remaining safe at home is important to avoid trips to the emergency department where families may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus and medical attention can be limited due to the burden on global health systems. Parents of children with FPIES are also understandably concerned about meeting their childâ€™s nutritional needs during these times of sheltering-in-place. Now more than ever, advice on what foods to serve and when to serve them is critically important.

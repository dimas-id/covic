We evaluated saliva samples from 149 children 2 to 11 years old for human bocavirus (hBoV) DNA. hBoV was detected in saliva samples at asymptomatic enrollment in 3% (5/149) and during respiratory illness in 2% (2/106) of the cases. hBoV was detected in only 1/149 asymptomatic and 0/106 illness nasal samples.

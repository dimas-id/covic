Patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) experience various degrees of liver function abnormalities. Liver injury requires extensive work-up and continuous surveillance and can be multifactorial and heterogeneous in nature. In the context of COVID-19, clinicians will have to determine whether liver injury is related to an underlying liver disease, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19, direct effect of the virus, or a complicated disease course. Recent studies proposed several theories on potential mechanisms of liver injury in these patients. This review summarizes current evidence related to hepatobiliary complications in COVID-19, provides an overview of the available case series and critically elucidates the proposed mechanisms and provides recommendations for clinicians.

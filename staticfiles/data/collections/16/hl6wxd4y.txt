Brazil is witnessing a massive increase of COVID‐19 cases and may face some difficulties, not only regarding to other respiratory pathogens, but also to other relevant issues parallelly occurring, for instance, the beggining of autumn and winter seasons, which provides a longer period with high transmissibility of respiratory viroses. Additionally, Brazil is localized in a geographical tropical area with relevant arboviral diseases, where Dengue fever presented highest incidence during March‐June, mainly at Southeast and Midwest regions, where probably it will occur overlapping curves of arboviruses and COVID‐19, which will overload our public health system. The main affected áreas by COVID‐19 in Brazil were the same that presented 66% of the Dengue fever cases in Brazil. Moreover, it is importante to highlight the difficulty found to distinguish Dengue fever and COVID‐19 and its implications, which present similar laboratorial and clinical characteristics. Besides that, it has been pointed out false‐positive results in serological tests for Dengue fever, which later were confirmed as COVID‐19. These issues demand urgent attention,once they culminate in serious and devastating impacts in the Brazilian health system, public health, and social conditions.

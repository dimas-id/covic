Abstract Viruses alter cellular physiology and function to establish cellular environment conducive for viral proliferation. Viral immune evasion is an essential aspect of viral persistence and proliferation. The multifaceted mitochondria play a central role in many cellular events such as metabolism, bioenergetics, cell death, and innate immune signaling. Recent findings accentuate that viruses regulate mitochondrial function and dynamics to facilitate viral proliferation. In this review, we will discuss how viruses exploit mitochondrial dynamics to modulate mitochondria-mediated antiviral innate immune response during infection. This review will provide new insight to understanding the virus-mediated alteration of mitochondrial dynamics and functions to perturb host antiviral immune signaling.

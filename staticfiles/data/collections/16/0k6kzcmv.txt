The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or "COVID-19" global pandemic began in late 2019. Like its predecessors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), COVID-19 binds to angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to facilitate tissue invasion, and potentially gain entry into the nervous system.1 This single-stranded RNA virus shares 75-80% identical genome sequence with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has increased virulence, persistence, and lethality.2 Amid catastrophic human suffering, severe neurological complications of COVID-19 have been identified; yet, subtle neurological manifestations have likely been under-reported.

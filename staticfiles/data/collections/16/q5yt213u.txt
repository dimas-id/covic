The immune scavenger protein DC-SIGN interacts with glycosylated proteins and has a putative role in facilitating viral infection. How these recognition events take place with different viruses is not clear and the effects of glycosylation on the folding and stability of DC-SIGN have not been reported. Here, we develop and apply a mass spectrometry-based approach to both uncover and characterise the effects of O-glycans on the stability of DC-SIGN. We first quantify the Core 1 & 2 O-glycan structures on the carbohydrate recognition and extracellular domains of the protein via sequential exoglycosidase sequencing. We then use ion mobility mass spectrometry to show how specific O-glycans, and/or single monosaccharide substitutions, alter both the overall collision cross section and the gas-phase stability of the glycoprotein isoforms of DC-SIGN. We find that rather than the mass or length of glycoprotein modifications, the stability of DC-SIGN is better correlated with the number of glycosylation sites. Collectively, our results exemplify a combined multi-dimensional MS approach, proficient in evaluating protein stability in response to both glycoprotein macro- and micro-heterogeneity and adding structural detail to the infection enhancer DC-SIGN.

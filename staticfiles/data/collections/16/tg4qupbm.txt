We attempted to prepare a cell line that produces maedi/visna virus (MVV) and is free of contamination by other viruses and mycoplasmas. Three cell lines, which originated from a sheep, goat and bat, were infected with MVV and passaged approximately every 5 days. The cultured cells were then subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis for MVV provirus. As a result, a cell line persistently infected with MVV was established from ZZ-R cells, which originated from the fetal goat tongue. The 50-fold concentrated culture fluid formed a precipitation line against reference antiserum.

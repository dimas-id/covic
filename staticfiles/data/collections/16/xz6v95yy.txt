BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To analyze standard operating procedures (SOP) of acute stroke imaging and interventions during COVID-19 pandemic with special emphasis on chest CT within a multimodal stroke protocol. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed via email to members of the Professional Organization of German Neuroradiologists (Berufsverband Deutscher Neuroradiologen e.V.). RESULTS: Answers were received from 25 units: eleven of them acquire chest CT, three in any patient and eight, when COVID-19 is suspected due to body temperature increase, patientâ€™s history or when the latter cannot be sufficiently obtained. Preliminary data indicate a high sensitivity and moderate negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: Different SOP reflect an uncertainty whether chest CT should be acquired as part of a multimodal stroke protocol. Accuracy of low dose chest CT cannot be determined yet. The strengths and limitations of chest CT are discussed.

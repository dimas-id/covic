This article shares how William Osler Health System (Osler) achieved improved quality of care for clinically challenging patients using state-of-the-art technology combined with interprofessional and intermanagerial teamwork in an acute care setting. Obstructive sleep apnea, a respiratory disorder caused by upper airway obstruction, increases the risk of complications after anesthesia. Although an initial postoperative monitoring strategy designed for patients with obstructive sleep apnea at Osler ensured patient safety, it required reorganization to resolve operational challenges. Concerned stakeholders at all levels contributed to the development and implementation of a new program approach focused on remote pulse oximetry monitoring as a component of the standard of care. Osler has developed a case study to share its experience with other hospitals and health systems that are already engaged in or that are considering implementing such a program.

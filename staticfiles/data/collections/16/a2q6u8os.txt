Nasopharyngeal stenosis secondary to chronic upper respiratory tract infection is described in four cats. The stenosis is caused by a thin but tough inflammatory membrane which develops across the proximal nasopharynx, partly or completely occluding it. Diagnosis is aided by use of a dental mirror for caudal rhinoscopy, together with test passage of a fine catheter through the ventral nasal meatus. All four cases were treated successfully by surgical resection of the membrane through an incision in the soft palate. Nasopharyngeal stenosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all chronic upper respiratory disease in cats.

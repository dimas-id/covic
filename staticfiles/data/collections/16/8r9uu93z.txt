COVID-19 has put a severe dent on the global economy and Indian Economy. International Monetary Fund has projected 1.9 percent for India. However, we believe that due to extended lockdown, the output in the first quarter is almost wiped out. The situation may improve in the second quarter onwards. Nevertheless, due to demand and supply constraints, input constraints and disruption in the supply chain, except agriculture, no other sector would be able to achieve full capacity of production in 2020-21. The signals from power consumption, GST collection, contraction in the core sectors hint towards a slump in the total output production in 2020-21. We derive the quarterly GVA for 2020-21 by using certain assumptions on the capacity utilisation in different sectors and using the quarterly data of 2019-20. We provide quarterly estimates of Gross Value Addition for 2020-21 under two scenarios. We have also estimated the fourth quarter output for 2019-20 under certain assumptions. We estimate

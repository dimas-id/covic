INTRODUCTION Meckel's diverticulum (MD) is a congenital true diverticulum that is residual yolk duct tissue, and some cases with complications require surgery. It has been reported that laparoscopic surgery is effective for patients with an MD. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 79-year-old man with melena visited our hospital. Upper gastrointestinal series and colonoscopy showed no bleeding lesion. Double-balloon endoscopy was then performed to examine the small intestine. The examination showed a large diverticulum 80cm proximal to the ileocecal valve and a circular ulcer. MD resection was performed using single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique through a 3-cm zig-zag incision in the umbilicus. Three ports were inserted for the scope and forceps devices. The MD was located 80cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. There were no other intestinal lesions. From the wound, the lesion could be easily moved outside the body. The MD including the ulcer lesion was then resected. The patient's postoperative course was good, and he rarely felt wound pain. He started dietary intake three days after surgery and was discharged from hospital eight days after surgery. DISCUSSION SILS technique has attracted attention in the field of laparoscopic surgery. Using a single port with multiple working channels, SILS can reduce the number of incisions and the rates of incisional hernia port site-related complications, as well as improve cosmesis. CONCLUSION A definite diagnosis of an MD was made by double-balloon endoscopy preoperatively. The SILS approach was effective for cosmesis, postoperative pain, and a shortened hospital stay.

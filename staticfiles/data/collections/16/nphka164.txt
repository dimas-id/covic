The temporal expression of the 54 Chilo iridescent virus (CIV) virion protein genes was investigated by combining drug treatments that inhibit protein or DNA synthesis and an RT-PCR strategy particularly suitable for non-polyadenylated mRNAs. This method generates a uniform 3' terminus by ligation of a 5'-phosphorylated oligonucleotide to the 3' end of the transcript that is recognized by a complementary primer during RT-PCR. This analysis showed that CIV virion proteins are encoded by genes in all three predetermined temporal classes: 23 immediate-early, 11 delayed-early and seven late virion gene transcripts were identified and assigned to ORFs. Early transcription of many virion protein genes supports the notion that virion proteins may also play essential roles in the initial stages of infection. In addition, some of the early gene products present in the virion may reflect the intracellular path that the virus follows during infection.

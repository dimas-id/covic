BACKGROUND The present study was conducted to compare operative time, postoperative course and outcome of LigaSure hemorrhoidectomy (LH), and conventional open hemorrhoidectomy (OH) for prolapsed hemorrhoids. METHODS Eighty-four patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids were randomized into two groups of 42 patients each; group 1 patients underwent LH whereas group 2 patients underwent OH. Data regarding patient demographics, operative details, postoperative pain score, amount of parenteral analgesics required, length of hospital stay, and time until return to work or normal physical activity were all prospectively collected. Postoperative complications and recurrence of prolapse were also recorded. All patients had regular follow-ups every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks postoperatively, and at 2-month intervals thereafter, for a total period of 12 months. RESULTS Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and length of hospital stay were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). The mean operative time, postoperative pain score (up to 48 h), amount of parenteral analgesics required, time off work, and time needed for complete wound healing were significantly less in patients who underwent LH (P < 0.001). Both groups had similar postoperative complications except for delayed wound healing that was observed at 4 weeks postoperatively, in seven patients (16.67%) in the LH group compared to 17 patients (40.48%) in the OH group (chi(2) = 5.83, P = 0.016). Although hemorrhoid recurrence, at 1 year, was also lower among the LH group compared to the OH group (2.38 vs. 9.14%, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS LH is a better alternative than conventional OH in treating prolapsed hemorrhoids (grades III and IV) since it reduces operating time, postoperative pain, and time off work, and allows surgical wounds to heal faster, with minimal comparable side effects and a low recurrence rate.

The rate of new virus discovery is increasing dramatically with improvements in sequencing and other molecular diagnostic platforms, and investments in sample collection and analysis. However, progress has been more limited in identification and implication of infectious agents that pose threats to human health and welfare. Here we review strategies for targeting research to enable efficient significant virus discovery.

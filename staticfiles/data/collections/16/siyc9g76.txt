Abstract There is increasing evidence that viral infection, expression of viral protein or the presence of viral DNA causes the host cell cycle to arrest during G2/M. The mechanisms used by viruses to cause arrest vary widely; some involve the activation of the cellular pathways that induce arrest in response to DNA damage, while others use completely novel means. The analysis of virus-mediated arrest has not been proven easy, and in most cases the consequences of arrest for the virus life cycle are not well defined. However, a number of effects of arrest are being investigated and it will be interesting to see to what extent perturbation of the G2/M transition is involved in viral infections.

Food and environmental virology has become a very important and interesting area of research because of food safety and public health concerns. During the last few decades, increasing foodborne diseases and environmental generated illnesses are considered to be highly challenging issues. Biosensor technology holds great promise for the healthcare market, and the security sector. Similar to clinical diagnostic tools, biosensors are being developed for the rapid, reliable, yet inexpensive identification and enumeration of pathogenic viruses which are adulterating environment, food and feed commodities. In this modern era, bio-and nano-technologies play a pivotal role in virological diagnostics of food industry, environmental and veterinary samples. This review covers the recent advances and future prospects of nanotechnology-based bioanalytical microsystems for food and environmental virology.

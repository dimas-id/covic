Clinical presentation of COVID-19 in children remains under investigation. In this manuscript, we present a summary of clinical findings from the first 23 cases of COVID-19 in children at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Considering the paucity of genomics data for circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Southern California, we also present an overview of the viral genetic diversity in isolates obtained from these patients and compare them to isolates from other parts of the United States and globally. Our study presents much needed clinical and viral genomics data pertaining to COVID-19 in children.

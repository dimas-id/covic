This case report describes a physician in the early 30ies with subjective anosmia and ageusia as the major presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Apart from a week of slightly runny nose when coming from cold to warm air, the only symptom was a sudden onset of persistent anosmia and ageusia. Two weeks after normalisation of the mild sino-nasal symptoms, the patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and anosmia was verified with Sniffin' Sticks tests. Hypogeusia was verified with taste screening and two validated taste tests. Olfactory and gustatory loss may be underestimated symptoms of COVID-19.

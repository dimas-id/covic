The commentaries by Burke and Johnston (this issue), Eid (this issue), Jungh√§nel et al. (this issue), and Willoughby (this issue) on Burns et al. (this issue) provide useful context for comparing three latent variable modeling approaches to understanding psychopathology-the correlated first-order syndrome-specific factors model, the bifactor S - 1 model, and the symmetrical bifactor model. The correlated first-order syndrome-specific factors model has proven useful in constructing explanatory models of psychopathology. The bifactor S - 1 model is also useful for examining the latent structure of psychopathology, especially in contexts with clear theoretical predictions. Joint use of correlated first-order syndrome-specific model and bifactor S - 1 model provides leverage for explaining psychopathology, and both models can also guide individual clinical assessment. In this reply, we further clarify reasons why the symmetrical bifactor model should not be used to study the latent structure of psychopathology and also discuss a restricted bifactor S - 1 model that is equivalent to the first-order syndrome-specific factors model.

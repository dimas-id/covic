Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of the major etiologies responsible for the acute, highly contagious disease in the digestive tract of pigs, especially neonatal piglets. Since PEDV was first identified in Europe in the late 1970s, it has resulted in significant economic losses in many Asian swine-raising countries, including China. Recently, reverse genetics techniques including targeted RNA recombination, bacteria artificial chromosome system and in vitro ligation have been successfully used to manipulate the genome of PEDV, which providing new strategies for the clear delineation of the functions of the viral proteins, the mechanisms behind PEDV pathogenesis and the design of novel vaccines against PEDV. Here, we review the progresses of different reverse genetics platforms developed for PEDV and their applications, covering the roles of trypsin in PEDV propagation, functions of S and ORF3 protein and the development of next generation PED vaccines, and the perspectives of reverse genetics for PEDV.

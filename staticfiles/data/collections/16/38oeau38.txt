TREC-COVID is a community evaluation designed to build a test collection that captures the information needs of biomedical researchers using the scientific literature during a pandemic. One of the key characteristics of pandemic search is the accelerated rate of change: the topics of interest evolve as the pandemic progresses and the scientific literature in the area explodes. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to capture this progression as it happens. TREC-COVID, in creating a test collection around COVID-19 literature, is building infrastructure to support new research and technologies in pandemic search.

Human activities have transformed Planet Earth to the extent that the functioning of its climate has been altered and a quarter of species face extinction (IPBES, 2019). These climate and biodiversity crises, which are interrelated and mutually reinforcing (Gardner et al. 2020), in turn have serious repercussions for humans, weakening the provision of ecosystem services and ultimately jeopardizing human civilization (Gowdy, 2020).

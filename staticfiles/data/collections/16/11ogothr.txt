Medical Information Systems (MIS) help medical practice and health care significantly. Security and dependability are two increasingly important factors for MIS nowadays. In one hand, people would be willing to step into the MIS age only when their privacy and integrity can be protected and guaranteed with MIS systems. On the other hand, only secure and reliable MIS systems would provide safe and solid medical and health care service to people. In this paper, we discuss some new security and reliability technologies which are necessary for and can be integrated with existing MISs and make the systems highly secure and dependable. We also present an implemented Middleware architecture which has been integrated with the existing VISTA/CPRS system in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs seamlessly and transparently.

BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of antral resection on weight loss and complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS This was a retrospective study of the prospectively collected data of patients who underwent LSG at Jordan University Hospital from February 2011 to February 2012. Patients were divided into two groups based on antral resection: group A underwent a 6-cm antral resection, and group B underwent a 2-cm antral resection. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was calculated at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS One hundred and ten patients were included in the study, all of whom completed at least 24 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 33 months). Their mean body mass index was 46.1 ± 7.9 kg/m(2). In group A, the mean %EWL was 38.1 ± 14.1, 54.9 ± 19.9, 65.6 ± 22.8, and 66.8 ± 28.4% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. However, in group B, the mean %EWL was 42.1 ± 13.4, 63.8 ± 19.8, 80.0 ± 22.1, and 81.5 ± 22.9% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Patients in group B experienced statistically significant greater weight loss than patients in group A. Statistically significant greater weight regain was seen in group A. Group A had a higher incidence of reflux symptoms (six patients; 11%) than group B (four patients; 7.1%). CONCLUSIONS Radical antral resection in association with LSG safely potentiates the restrictive effect achieved and may result in greater and better maintained weight loss.

Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS) is considered the most effective surgical option for morbidly obese patients. Several techniques have been described: open, laparoscopic, and the combination of open and laparoscopic. Only a few centers in the world perform robotically-assisted laparoscopic BPD/DS and the published literature is limited. We describe our experience using this technique as a safe alternative for treatment of morbid obesity. A review of a prospectively maintained database from 2008 to 2011 was conducted. A total of 107 consecutive patients (F:M = 83:24) were included in this series. Average age was 44.76 years (range 20-67), body mass index 49.97 kg/m(2) (range 37-70), and the number of preoperative comorbidities was 6.24 (range 3-11). The mean operative time for a typical BPD/DS with or without an appendectomy was 264 min (range 192-413), which increased to 298 min (range 210-463) when lysis of adhesion or additional procedures were performed. All study cases were completed using a minimally invasive approach. There were no intraoperative or 30-day major postoperative complications. Two patients returned to the operating room: one for endoscopic release of an inadvertently-sutured nasogastric tube during creation of the duodeno-ileal anastomosis and another patient for a port-site infection. Minor postoperative complications included carpal tunnel syndrome exacerbation (n = 1), which did not require surgical intervention. The median length of stay was 3.0 days (range 2-13). Two patients were readmitted within 30 day due to fluid retention and incarcerated umbilical hernia. The percentages of excess body weight loss (EBWL) at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months were 18.9, 36.4, 54.5, 67.4, 73.9, and 82.42 %, respectively. No mortality occurred in this study. Robotically-assisted laparoscopic technique for BPD/DS is a feasible, safe, and effective alternative for weight loss surgery with excellent outcomes.

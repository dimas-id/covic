Purpose To ascertain delirium prevalence and outcomes in COVID-19. Methods We conducted a point-prevalence study in a cohort of COVID-19 inpatients at University College Hospital. Delirium was defined by DSM-IV criteria. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 4 weeks; secondary outcomes were physical and cognitive function. Results In 71 patients, 31 (42%) had delirium, of which only 19 had been recognised by the clinical team. At 4 weeks, 20 (28%) had died, 26 (36%) were interviewed by telephone and 21 (30%) remained as inpatients. Physical function was substantially worse in people after delirium (-39 points on functional scale/166, 95% CI -92 to -21, p=0.01) (Table 2). Mean cognitive scores at follow-up were similar and delirium was not associated with mortality in this sample. Conclusions Our findings indicate that delirium is common, yet under-recognised. Delirium is associated with functional impairments in the medium-term.

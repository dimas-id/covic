PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The expanding population of immunocompromised patients coupled with the recognition of a growing number of different species of fungi responsible for diseases in such hosts makes the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI) a challenging task. The recent advances and challenges in the diagnosis of IFI in the setting of immunocompromised hosts are reviewed. The advantages and limitations of histopathology and the role of culture-independent methods, such as those based on the use of nucleic acids applied to fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, besides culture- and non-culture-based diagnostic methods, to obtain a timely and correct diagnosis of IFI are highlighted. RECENT FINDINGS: The therapeutic implications of identifying the genus and species of the fungus present in the specimen with the molecular diagnostics applied to tissue specimens are reviewed. No method alone is efficient in correctly identifying fungi and it is essential to combine the traditional histochemical staining with molecular methods to achieve a rapid and genus-/species-specific diagnosis of IFI. SUMMARY: We review the recent findings and challenges in the hystopathologic diagnosis of IFI in the setting of immunocompromised hosts. Non method alone is efficient in correctly identify fungi and pathologists should combine classic staining with molecular methods to achieve a rapid and genus/species fungal diagnosis.

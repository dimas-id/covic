During the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, a 27-year- old Japanese woman presented a high fever and acute respiratory distress with pulmonary infiltrates after traveling to a high-risk area. An alternative diagnosis was made as Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, based on the proliferation of macrophages with hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow and Epstein-Barr viral marker profiles. Virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome in an international traveler should be included in the differential diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome.

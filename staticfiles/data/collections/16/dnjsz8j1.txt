It is well understood that ultraviolet‐C (UVC) radiation is effective for the destruction of micro‐organisms and drug‐resistant bacteria and is being investigated for its effectiveness at destroying the virus responsible for the current Covid‐19 global pandemic. Far‐UVC (200 ‐ 220 nm) has been proposed as an effective disinfection radiation that is safe to humans. In 2014, Woods et al. undertook a first‐in‐person study to assess the effect on skin of a 222 nm UVC emitting device (Sterilray disinfectant wand, Healthy Environment Innovations, Dover, NH, USA).

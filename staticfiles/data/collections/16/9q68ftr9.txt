This chapter outlines the two most commonly used methods of virus isolationâ€”namely, tissue cultures and embryonated eggs. The chapter describes the methodology involved for the predominant virus groups that cover the majority of viruses encountered in the clinical situation. The chapter also describes selected methods of virus assay and the calculation of virus titers. Nasal swabs are the easiest specimens to collect for respiratory viruses and are also the best specimens for the majority of the respiratory viruses described in the chapter. Hemadsorption is a fast and convenient method of detecting orthomyxoviruses and non respiratory syncytial virus paramyxoviruses in cell cultures in which the cytopathic effect vary from obvious to minimal.

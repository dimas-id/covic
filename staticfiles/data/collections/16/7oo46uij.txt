Pasteurella gallinarum-related outbreaks in chickens and African guinea fowls are described. Four outbreaks were recorded in chickens and one in guinea fowls. Periorbital swelling and keratoconjunctivitis were the consistently present clinical signs in all the diseased birds. In several, swollen hocks and wattles were also discerened. Birds which succumbed to the infection showed petechiation in the internal organs and evidence of airsacculitis. Pasteurella gallinarum was isolated from the lesions and also from conjunctival swabs of the apparently healthy in-contact birds. There was no evidence of concurrent infection with Haemophilus, Mycoplasma or Chlamydia. Quinolone therapy when resorted to on one of the farms resolved the clinical signs. Phenotypes of 28 isolates were studied. The results compared well with the Pasteurella gallinarum isolates reported earlier from elsewhere. It was also found that results of xylose fermentation and ONPG test appear to be a variable character. There is no earlier report of P. gallinarum infection in guinea fowls.

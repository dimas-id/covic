BACKGROUND The clinical manifestations of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection resemble those of respiratory syncytial virus with the most severe disease occurring in infants, the elderly, chronically ill, and immunocompromised hosts. OBSERVATION We present a case of a 2-year-old girl undergoing intensive chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma who developed severe hMPV pneumonia. Rapid and complete recovery was observed after treatment with oral ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin. CONCLUSION As hMPV can cause severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients and due to the reports of effective treatment with ribavirin, clinical studies to elucidate the role of ribavirin in treatment of hMPV pneumonia may be needed.

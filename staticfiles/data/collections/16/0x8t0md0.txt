Tracheal bronchus is a congenital anatomical variant of patients with accessory bronchus in the right upper lobe deriving directly from the supracarinal trachea. Pre-operative consultation with the anesthesiologist is important for patient safety and can avoid adverse effects induced by endotracheal intubation. In this report, we described a case of tracheal bronchus in which general anesthesia was performed for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. We discussed some of the issues surrounding to complications in tracheal bronchus.

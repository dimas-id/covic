Two hundred and six strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from chickens showing signs of disease in southern China during the period from 2013–2015. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences from the isolated field strains were compared to 42 published references. Nucleotide homologies ranged from 63.1–99.9% and amino acid homologies ranging from 60.2–100%. At least seven IBV genotypes were co-circulating in commercial chicken farms in southern China. The IBV isolates were genetically diverse and underwent continuing evolution. The QX-type, TW I-type, and 4/91-type were the most common genotypes during the three-year observation period and accounted for 88.8% of the isolated strains. Notably, the prevalence of the TW I-type strains has been increasing in recent years and has become the most common genotype in China. The emergence of variant IBV strains can be attributed to recombination. Serologic analysis and antigenic 3D cartography of 4 reference and 14 field isolated strains indicated the surveyed IBVs had diverse serology types and that the serotype of the isolated QX-type and TW I-type strains was distinct from the vaccines strains. Therefore, long-term continuing surveillance is necessary for IBV prevention and control.

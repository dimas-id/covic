Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Coronavirus has been associated with this severe emerging disease, with a pattern suggesting droplet or contact transmission. From April to June 2003, Institute Adolfo Lutz received 16 respiratory secretions from hospitalized patients with recent history of travel to an area with local transmission of SARS. Rapid antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus; electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription PCR (RTâ€“PCR) and serologic assay were performed. Virus isolation attempts were performed in Hep-2, Vero, MDCK, NCI-H292, MRC-5, LLC-MK2 and FRhK-4. Influenza virus of type A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N2) were identified.

Exploring a knowledge base is often an iterative process: initially vague information needs are refined by interaction. We propose a novel approach for such interaction that supports sequential question answering (SQA) on knowledge graphs. As opposed to previous work, we focus on exploratory settings, which we support with a visual representation of graph structures, helping users to better understand relationships. In addition, our approach keeps track of context – an important challenge in SQA – by allowing users to make their focus explicit via subgraph selection. Our results show that the interaction principle is either understood immediately or picked up very quickly – and that the possibility of exploring the information space iteratively is appreciated.

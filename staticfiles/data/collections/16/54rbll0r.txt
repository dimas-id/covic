BACKGROUND Over the past few decades, studies have focused on the safety of stapled anastomosis, especially when compared to that of the handsewn technique. However, studies on the improvement of stapling technology are limited. This study aimed to investigate whether linear triple-row staples (tri-staples) had any advantage over double-row staples. METHODS This is a retrospective review of all cases of functional end-to-end anastomoses with linear staplers performed at two centers between 2005 and 2015. Data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Cases of anastomoses performed with double-row (DS) and triple-row (TS) staples were matched according to propensity scores. The rates of anastomotic leakage, bleeding, reoperation, and 30-day mortality were compared. RESULTS Functional end-to-end ileocolic anastomoses were performed in 563 consecutive patients during the study period. Double- and triple-row stapling devices were used in 389 and 174 anastomoses, respectively. With propensity score matching, 170 cases were chosen from each group. Both groups showed comparable baseline characteristics. The anastomotic leakage, anastomotic bleeding, and intra-abdominal collection rates were 2.4 and 0% (p = 0.123), 1.2 and 0% (p = 0.499), and 3.5 and 1.2% (p = 0.283) for DS and TS, respectively. The reoperation and 30-day mortality rates were 5.9 and 1.8% (p = 0.048) and 0.6 and 1.2% (p = 1.000) for DS and TS, respectively. The median lengths of stay were 5 and 6 days (p = 0.072) for DS and TS, respectively. CONCLUSION Anastomoses with triple-row staples tended to have a lower morbidity rate, but a significant advantage over double-row staples was not demonstrated in this study.

Abstract: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening manifestation of venous thromboembolic disease. SARS-COV2, a novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has been associated with increased risk of thrombosis. We describe the therapeutic challenges of three patients presenting with PE and suspected or confirmed COVID-19.

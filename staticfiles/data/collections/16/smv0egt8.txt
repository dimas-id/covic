We aimed to evaluate the regulatory effects of propofol on high-dose remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. A total of 180 patients receiving laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly divided into sevoflurane + high-dose remifentanil (SH) group, sevoflurane + low-dose remifentanil (SL) group and propofol + high-dose remifentanil group (PH) group (n=60). After intravenous administration of midazolam, SH and SL groups were induced with sevoflurane and remifentanil, and PH group was induced with propofol and remifentanil. During anesthesia maintenance, SH and SL groups were given 0.3 microg/kg/min and 0.1 microg/kg/min sevoflurane and remifentanil respectively, and PH group was given 0.3 microg/kg/min propofol and remifentanil. The three groups had significantly different awakening time, extubation time and total dose of remifentanil (P<0.001). Compared with SL group, periumbilical mechanical pain thresholds 6 h and 24 h after surgery significantly decreased in SH group (P<0.05), and the visual analog scale (VAS) scores significantly increased 30 min, 2 h and 6 h after surgery (P<0.05). Compared with SH group, periumbilical mechanical thresholds 6 h and 24 h after surgery were significantly higher in PH group (P<0.05), and VAS scores 30 min, 2 h and 6 h after surgery were significantly lower (P<0.05). PH group first used patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump significantly later than SL group did (P<0.05). The total consumptions of sufentanil in PH and SL groups were significantly lower than that of SH group (P<0.05). The incidence rates of bradycardia and postoperative chill in PH and SH groups were significantly higher than those of SL group (P<0.05). Anesthesia by infusion of high-dose remifentanil plus sevoflurane caused postoperative hyperalgesia which was relieved through intravenous anesthesia with propofol.

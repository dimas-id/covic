Pink Dot SG is an LGBTQ social movement in Singapore, which since its inception in 2009 organizes an annual free-to-all public gathering in the Speaker's Corner at Hong Lim Park. Over the years, the gathering has grown in size, and has gained national and international visibility. Prior to the event each year, a set of official YouTube promotional videos is released on its website in order to announce the event and garner support for the movement and participation at the event. In this article, I examine the politics of language performances in the videos from 2009 to 2019, which seeks to blend social legitimacy and authenticity in strategic ways in achieving a ‘linguistic homonationalism’. Linguistic homonationalism, in this study, refers to the harnessing of language ideological choices to align with nationalistic values in the promotion of LGBTQ interests.

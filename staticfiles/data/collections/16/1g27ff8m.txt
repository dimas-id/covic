PURPOSE For the last 20 years, the predominant robot used in laparoscopic surgery has been Da Vinci by Intuitive Surgical. This monopoly situation has led to rising costs and relatively slow innovation. This article aims to discuss the two new robotic devices for laparoscopic surgery which have received regulatory approval for human use in different parts of the world. MATERIALS A short description of the Senhance Surgical Robotic System and the REVO-I Robot Platform and their pros and cons compared to the Da Vinci system is presented. A discussion about the differences between the three robotic systems now in the market is presented, as well as a short review of the present state of robotic assistance in surgery and where we are headed.

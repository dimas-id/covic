To assess whether our novel uterus-sparing procedure- laparoscopic organopexy with non-mesh genital(LONG) suspension is an effective, safe, and timesaving surgery for the treatment of apical prolapse. Forty consecutive women with main uterine prolapse stage II or greater defined by the POP quantification(POP-Q) staging system were referred for LONG procedures at our hospitals. Clinical evaluations before and 6 months after surgery included pelvic examination, urodynamic study, and a personal interview to evaluate urinary and sexual symptoms with overactive bladder symptom score(OABSS), the short forms of Urogenital Distress Inventory(UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire(IIQ-7), and the Female Sexual Function Index(FSFI). After follow-up time of 12 to 30 months, anatomical cure rate was 85%(34/40), and the success rates for apical, anterior, and posterior vaginal prolapse were 95%(38/40), 85%(34/40), and 97.5%(39/40), respectively. Six recurrences of anterior vaginal wall all suffered from significant cystocele (stage3; Ba>+1) preoperatively. The average operative time was 73.1 Â± 30.8 minutes. One bladder injury occurred and was recognized during surgery. The dyspareunia domain and total FSFI scores of the twelve sexually-active premenopausal women improved postoperatively in a significant manner (P < 0.05). The results of our study suggest that LONG suspension is an effective and safe uterus-sparing surgery for the treatment of apical prolapse.

The haemostatic system acts in concert with inflammation, so that after inflammatory response various mediators activate the haemostatic system through endothelial dysfunction, platelet activation and coagulation promoting thrombosis, which is termed thromboinflammation. In this process, the inflammasome acquires special relevance; its stimulation promotes innate and adaptive immune responses. Inflammasome activation plays an important physiopathological role in several disorders with inflammatory and thrombotic phenomena. The role of thromboinflammation has become relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a cytokine storm has been described as one of the responsible mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has continued to cause sporadic outbreaks of severe respiratory tract infection over the last 8 years. METHODS: Complete genome sequencing using next-generation sequencing was performed for MERS-CoV isolates from cases that occurred in Riyadh between 2015 and 2019. Phylogenetic analysis and molecular mutational analysis were carried out to investigate disease severity. RESULTS: A total of eight MERS-CoV isolates were subjected to complete genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis resulted in the assembly of 7/8 sequences within lineage 3 and one sequence within lineage 4 showing complex genomic recombination. The isolates contained a variety of unique amino acid substitutions in ORF1ab (41), the N protein (10), the S protein (9) and ORF4b (5). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that MERS-CoV is evolving. The emergence of new variants carries the potential for increased virulence and could impose a challenge to the global health system. We recommend the sequencing every new MERS-CoV isolate to observe the changes in the virus and relate them to clinical outcomes.

The field of medicine has long been defined not only by diagnostic and treatment techniques but also by standards of behavior. The Hippocratic Oath was introduced about the same time as the concept of case histories and prognosis, in ancient Greece, fifth century BCE. Despite vast changes in medicine through the ages, the oathâ€™s core message continues to resonate: that a physician has a special responsibility to perform honorably. Forms of the Hippocratic Oath are still recited during graduation ceremonies at medical schools, many in the United States, though the classical version has been altered to suit contemporary values.(1) For example, passages in the early oath that prohibited the practice of abortion or euthanasia now are commonly omitted. The shifting text is a reflection of attempts to accommodate medical ethics to new findings, experiences, and values.

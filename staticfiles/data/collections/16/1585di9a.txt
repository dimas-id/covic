Objective The aim of this study was to assess the presence of respiratory viruses in CF patients at routine visits during the two-month period (November-December 2014) and to determine the clinical impact of this finding. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs/aspirates from 35 patients were tested using a PCR method (Serplex® RV15 Onestep ACE Detection), detecting 15 respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus (RV), metapneumovirus, boccavirus and enterovirus). Results Patients were 2–24 yrs old (AVR 12 y), 13 chronically colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Lung function test for 30 subjects showed: 9 normal findings; 11 mild, 7 moderate and 3 severe lung disease. There was no significant difference regarding lung function or PA status between the subgroups of patients positive or negative for viruses. Viruses were detected in 4/35 subjects (2 RV, 1 enterovirus, 1 parainfluenza virus 3) and 3 had concomitant PA isolation (1 chronic colonisation). However, no acute worsening of the respiratory status was found, determined as the presence of fever and upper respiratory symptoms or a recent change in at least two of the following: sputum volume or colour, cough intensity, increased malaise, increased dyspnea, loss of appetite, a decrease of FEV1 >10% (modified Fuchs criteria). Conclusion In this pilot study chronic PA infection wasn't associated with a higher rate of viral detection and no immediate negative consequences of virus detection on the respiratory status of CF patients was observed. Further study is needed.

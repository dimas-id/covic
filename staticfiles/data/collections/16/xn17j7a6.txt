Salmonella enterica serotype I 4,[5],12:i:- has been increasingly isolated from swine. However, its pathogenic potential is not well characterized. Analysis of swine cases confirmed a strong positive association between isolation of I 4,[5],12:i:- and lesions of enteric salmonellosis and suggested a similar pathogenic potential as that for Salmonella Typhimurium.

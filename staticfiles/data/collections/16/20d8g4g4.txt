The advancement in Molecular techniques has been implicated in the development of sophisticated, high-end diagnostic platform and point-of-care (POC) devices for the detection of biothreat agents. Different molecular and immunological approaches such as Immunochromatographic and lateral flow assays, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assays (ELISA), Biosensors, Isothermal amplification assays, Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), Next Generation Sequencers (NGS), Microarrays and Microfluidics have been used for a long time as detection strategies of the biothreat agents. In addition, several point of care (POC) devices have been approved by FDA and commercialized in markets. The high-end molecular platforms like NGS and Microarray are time-consuming, costly, and produce huge amount of data. Therefore, the future prospects of molecular based technique should focus on developing quick, user-friendly, cost-effective and portable devices against biological attacks and surveillance programs.

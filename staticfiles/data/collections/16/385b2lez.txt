Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) outbreak is the most dramatic event since World War II. Originating as a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia, it turned out that this viral disease termed COVID-19 is not only a respiratory infection, but a systemic disease associated with a number of extrapulmonary complications. One of the medical disciplines that is strongly affected by this viral infection is gastroenterology. COVID-19 causes in some patients typical symptoms of enteritis such as diarrhea or abdominal pain. There is also evidence that this infection may lead to liver and pancreatic injury. Since the SARS-CoV2 virus was detected in stool, a fecal-oral route of transmission is possible. Moreover, viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and enables the invasion of the gastrointestinal epithelium as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the daily practice and the workflows in endoscopy leading to a dramatic decrease of screening and surveillance procedures. COVID-19 impacts the therapy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those using high doses of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics. Patients with preexisting liver disease, especially metabolic associated liver fatty disease (MALFD) with fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, are at high risk for severe COVID-19. As long as no active vaccine against SARS-CoV2 is available, gastroenterologists have to be aware of these problems that affect their daily routine practice.

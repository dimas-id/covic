Abstract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is often acquired in individuals already infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a result of shared routes of transmission. Since current options for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections are limited, there is an essential need for the development of effective therapies against HIV/HBV co-infections. RNA interference (RNAi) has been used as a powerful tool to silence genes in cells and animals. In this study, we developed a small interfering RNA generation system that expressed two different siRNAs to target the HBs gene of HBV and the gp120 gene of HIV in Bel-7402 and HEK293T cells, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the two siRNA molecules could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and gp120 by 81% and 89%, respectively. In addition, dual siRNA molecules significantly decreased the production of HBs, and simultaneously inhibited the replication of HBV and HIV. This dual siRNA generation system not only proved to be a novel approach for studying functions of multiple genes simultaneously, but also provides a potential approach for the treatment and prevention of HIV and HBV co-infection.

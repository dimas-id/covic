The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unfolded with remarkable speed, posing unprecedented challenges for health care systems and society. Otolaryngologists have a special role in responding to this crisis by virtue of expertise in airway management. Against the backdrop of nations struggling to contain the virus's spread and to manage hospital strain, otolaryngologists must partner with anesthesiologists and front-line health care teams to provide expert services in high-risk situations while reducing transmission. Airway management and airway endoscopy, whether awake or sedated, expose operators to infectious aerosols, posing risks to staff. This commentary provides background on the outbreak, highlights critical considerations around mitigating infectious aerosol contact, and outlines best practices for airway-related clinical decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. What otolaryngologists need to know and what actions are required are considered alongside the implications of increasing demand for tracheostomy. Approaches to managing the airway are presented, emphasizing safety of patients and the health care team.

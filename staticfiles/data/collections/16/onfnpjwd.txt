The advent of laparoscopic surgery and with it Laparoscopic Ventral Mesh Rectopexy (LVMR) has revolutionised the management of internal/external rectal and vaginal vault prolapse. These procedures have traditionally been performed with synthetic meshes. Biologics have gained a prominent role over the last decade in LVMR as well as perineal procedures for rectocoele and cystocoele repair. We examine the existing literature on the use of biologics in pelvic floor surgery comparing this with literature on synthetic mesh for the key outcomes of infection rates, bowel/sexual function and recurrence.

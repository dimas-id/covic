BACKGROUND Since the early 1990s, laparoscopy has provided surgeons with new and innovative ways to treat various surgical problems. Many of these minimally invasive techniques have gained universal acceptance by demonstrating improved patient outcomes. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed with the aim of reducing the invasiveness of traditional laparoscopy. Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) herniorrhaphy via the three-trocar technique is widely used for recurrent inguinal hernia. To the author's knowledge, this report describes first series of SILS TAPP for recurrent inguinal hernia repair. METHODS From April 2009 to March 2010, 15 single-incision laparoscopic TAPP repairs of recurrent inguinal hernia were performed by the same surgical team. The data collected prospectively included patient demographics, type of hernia, operative time, complications, postoperative hospital stay, and recurrence. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients using a single port, and the same operative technique was used in all cases. RESULTS The SILS TAPP procedure was performed successfully for all the patients, and none required conversion to an open procedure or a conventional laparoscopic hernia repair by the addition of more entry ports. The mean operative time was 51 ± 17 min. No intra- or postoperative complications were recorded. There was no evidence of early recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 130 ± 77 days. CONCLUSION Based on this experience, the author believes that SILS approach is technically feasible and safe using standard and slightly modified instruments for standard TAPP. The cosmetic benefit is clear, but the advantages of SILS TAPP over conventional laparoscopic surgery during long-term follow-up evaluation will require further randomized clinical trials.

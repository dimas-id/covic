Abstract To examine the effect of provision of information about the infection control in the specific infection disease treatment unit in a city hospital on the outpatient’s intention of outpatient service use, respondents who underwent outpatient medical care at the hospital (N = 821) were asked whether or not they intended to continue the outpatient visit at the hospital if a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient was admitted to the unit. Although 56% of respondents replied that they could continue to visit the department if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital before they read the information, the proportion of those who intended to continue outpatient care significantly increased by 15% after they read it. The logistic regression analyses revealed that respondents who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P < 0.001), those who felt relieved by reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection inside the hospital (P < 0.001) were significantly more likely to reply that they would continue outpatient visits. We estimated that admission of a SARS patient to the unit would result in a 20% decrease in the cumulative total number of outpatients in the hospital during a 180-day interval after admission of a SARS patient to the unit, and the cumulative total number of outpatients increased by 7% after they read the information. This study suggests that providing outpatients with appropriate information about SARS infection control in the hospital had a statistically significant and substantial impact on the outpatients’ intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital.

The cellular mechanisms by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication might mediate cytopathic effects are controversial and not entirely clear. In this study, we found that blood‐borne HCV (bbHCV) infection could lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)‐stress and mitochondria‐related/caspase‐dependent apoptosis at the early stages of infection based on use of the highly efficient bbHCV cell culture model established previously. Sections of bbHCV‐infected human fetal liver stem cells (hFLSCs) revealed convolution and nonlinear ER, cell vacuolization, swelling of mitochondria, and numerous double membrane vesicles (DMVs). The percentage of apoptotic hFLSCs infected by bbHCV reached 29.8% at 16 h postinfection, and the amount of cytochrome c increased remarkably in the cytosolic protein fraction. However, over time, apoptosis was inhibited due to the activation of NF‐κB. The expression of NF‐κB‐p65, Bcl‐xL, XIAP, and c‐FLIPL in hFLSCs was increased significantly 24 h after in infection by bbHCV. The accelerated cell death cycles involving apoptosis, regeneration and repair by bbHCV infection might give rise to the development of cirrhosis, and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

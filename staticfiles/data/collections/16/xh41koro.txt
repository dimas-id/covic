The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an unprecedented pandemic. Since the first sequenced whole-genome of SARS-CoV-2 on January 2020, the identification of its genetic variants has become crucial in tracking and evaluating their spread across the globe. In this study, we compared 15,259 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 60 countries since the outbreak of this novel coronavirus with the first sequenced genome in Wuhan to quantify the evolutionary divergence of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we compared the codon usage patterns, every two weeks, of 13 of SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding for the membrane protein (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S), nucleoprotein (N), non-structural 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), ssRNA-binding protein (RBP), 2â€™-O-ribose methyltransferase (OMT), endoRNase (RNase), helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Nsp7, Nsp8, and exonuclease ExoN. As a general rule, we find that SARS-CoV-2 genome tends to diverge over time by accumulating mutations on its genome and, specifically, on the coding sequences for proteins N and S. Interestingly, different patterns of codon usage were observed among these genes. Genes S, Nsp7, NSp8, tend to use a norrower set of synonymous codons that are better optimized to the human host. Conversely, genes E and M consistently use a broader set of synonymous codons, which does not vary with respect to the reference genome. We identified key SARS-CoV-2 genes (S, N, ExoN, RNase, RdRp, Nsp7 and Nsp8) suggested to be causally implicated in the virus adaptation to the human host.

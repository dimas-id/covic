STUDY OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, ease of placement, and ventilatory parameters of a new alternate airway device, the EasyTube (EzT; Teleflex Ruesch, Research Triangle Park, NC), in comparison to the endotracheal tube (ETT). DESIGN Prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING University Hospital. SUBJECTS 200 adult ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for surgery. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to two groups, one to receive ventilation via the EzT (n = 100) or the ETT (n = 100). After preoxygenation and induction with fentanyl and propofol, patients received muscle relaxation. The respective airway device was then inserted and mechanical ventilation was instituted. MEASUREMENTS Ease of insertion, number of insertion maneuvers, time until airtight seal of the airway was achieved, duration of surgery, leak pressure as well as arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) data, were recorded. MAIN RESULTS Mallampati airway class was higher in the EzT group (P < 0.029), while thyromental distance showed no difference between the two groups. Ease of insertion was noted in the EzT group (P < 0.043). Number of insertions was equal in both groups; insertion time was shorter with the EzT (15.5 +/- 3.6 sec vs. 19.3 +/- 4.6 sec; P < 0.0001). Leak pressure and SpO(2) were not significantly different, while ETCO(2) was lower with the ETT (P < 0.024). Adjustments had to be made for two EzT group patients. No difference in frequency of laryngo-pharyngeal discomfort was observed in either group. CONCLUSION Insertion of an EzT appears to reduce time and facilitate placement of an airway device when compared with direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.

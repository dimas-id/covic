The Romanian Society of Digestive Endoscopy (SRED) and the Romanian Association of Endoscopic Surgery (ARCE) have decided to establish a joint working group to elaborate specific recommendations for organizing the diagnostic and the minimally invasive interventional procedures, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The recommendations are based on the guidelines of the international societies of endoscopy and gastroenterology (ESGE / BSG / ASGE / ACG / AGA), respectively endoscopic surgery (EAES SAGES) (4-8), on the experience of countries severely affected by the pandemic (Italy, France, Spain, USA, Germany, etc.) and they will be applied within the limits of measures imposed at local and governmental level by the competent authorities. On the other hand, these recommendations should have a dynamic evolution, depending on the upward or downward trend of the COVID-19 pandemic at regional and local level, but also according to the findings of professional and academic societies, requiring regular reviews based on the publica tion of further recommendations or international clinical trials. The objectives of the SRED and ARCE recommendations target the endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery activities, to support their non discriminatory used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, pursuing the demonstrated benefits of these procedures, in safe conditions for patients and medical staff.

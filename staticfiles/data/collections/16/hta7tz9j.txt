OBJECTIVE To investigate measures to prevent the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in healthcare workers in isolation units. METHODS The architectural factors and the infection of healthcare workers in different wards in our hospital between 30 January 2003 and 30 March 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS Four kinds of isolation wards were evaluated, including the ward where the thirty-first bed lied in on the twelfth floor, the laminar flow ward in the intensive care unit (ICU) where the tenth bed lied in on the fifteenth floor, the ward where the twenty-seventh bed lied in on the thirteenth floor of Building A, and thirty wards on the fourteenth to eighteenth floors of Building B. The ratios (m2/m3) of the area of the ventilation windows to the volume of the room were 0, 0, 1:95 and 1:40, respectively. Numbers of SARS cases in the wards mentioned above were 1, 1, 1 and 96, respectively. The total lengths (hour) of hospitalization were 43, 168, 110 and 1,272, respectively. The infection rates of the healthcare workers in the areas mentioned above were 73%, 32%, 28% and 2%, respectively. The difference of the infection rates was of statistical significance. CONCLUSION In addition to strict personal protective measures, isolation of SARS cases in wards with high ratio of the area of ventilation windows to the volume of the room and good ventilation may be the key to preventing the outbreak of SARS in healthcare workers in isolation units.

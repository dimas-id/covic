BACKGROUND Recently, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) was widely used in the perioperative management of gastric cancer. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ERAS in single-incision laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (SIDG). MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 90 patients who received laparoscopic gastric cancer resection were divided into 3 groups: group A (n=30), underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with conventional perioperative management; group B (n=30) underwent traditional multiport laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with ERAS concept; and group C (n=30), underwent SIDG with ERAS concept. Clinical data and gut function were assessed in 3 groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in terms of postoperative complication, number of resected lymph nodes and blood loss among 3 groups. However, operation time was longer (P=0.003) and treatment cost was higher (P<0.001) in group C than that in group A and B. Group C had faster recovery of bowel function (P<0.001), shorter postoperative hospital stay (P=0.002), and less postoperative complication (P=0.044) than those in group A. There were no significant differences in terms of recovery of bowel function and postoperative hospital stay between group C and B (all P>0.05). The white blood cell counts were lower than group A and B (all P<0.05) and C-reactive protein in group C were lower than group A (P<0.05) and B (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that SIDG with ERAS may be a feasible and safe procedure for early gastric cancer because it provides a favorable cosmetic result while not compromising postoperative complications, number of resected lymph nodes, and blood loss.

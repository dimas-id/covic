PURPOSE To report a single centre's experience of the endovascular treatment of renal arterial aneurysms, including techniques and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of true renal arterial aneurysms (TRAAs) treated using endovascular techniques over a period of 12 years and 10 months. The clinical presentations, aneurysm characteristics, endovascular techniques and outcomes are reported. RESULTS There were nine TRAA cases with a mean aneurysm size of 21.0 mm, located at the main renal arterial bifurcation in all cases. Onyx(®) was used as the embolic agent of choice (88.9 % cases), with concurrent balloon remodelling. The overall primary technical success rate was 100 %. Repeat intervention was carried out in 1 case, secondary to reperfusion >8 years post-initial treatment. Long-term clinical follow-up was available in 55.6 % of cases (mean 29.8 months; range 3.3-90.1 months). Early post-procedural renal function, as measured by serum creatinine, remained within the normal reference range. Renal parenchymal loss post-embolisation was ≤20 % in 77.8 % of cases, as estimated on imaging. Minor complications included non-target embolization of Onyx(®) with no clinical sequelae (n = 1), transient pain requiring only oral analgesia with no prolongation of hospital stay (n = 2). No major complications occurred as a consequence of embolisation. CONCLUSION Endovascular therapy is an effective and safe primary therapy for TRAA with high success rate and low morbidity, supplanting surgery as primary therapy. Current experience in the use of Onyx(®) in TRAA is primarily limited to individual case reports, and this represents the largest case series of Onyx(®)-treated TRAAs to date.

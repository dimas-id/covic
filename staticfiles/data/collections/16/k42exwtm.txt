OBJECTIVES Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is an effective treatment for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), but postoperative residual hypertension leads to in-hospital mortality. Inhaled epoprostenol sodium (PGI2) and NO are administered for pulmonary hypertension after cardiothoracic surgery. This prospective study provides the first comparative evaluation of the effects of inhaled PGI2 and NO on pulmonary hemodynamics, systemic hemodynamics, and gas exchange in patients developing residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. METHODS Thirteen patients were randomized to receive either NO (n = 6) or PGI2 (n = 7) inhalation when pulmonary hypertension persisted after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured before inhalation of the agent (T0); 30 min (T1), 3 h (T2), and 6 h after inhalation (T3); and the next morning (T4). The NO dose was started at 20 ppm and gradually tapered until extubation, and PGI2 was administered at a dose of 10 ng kg-1 min-1. RESULTS In both groups, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) significantly decreased over time until T4 (mean PAP: p < 0.0001; PVR: p = 0.003), while mean systemic arterial blood pressure significantly increased (p = 0.028). There were no significant between-group differences in patient characteristics, cardiac index, left atrial pressure, or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen. There were no in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS Both inhaled PGI2 and NO significantly reduced PAP and PVR without adverse effects on systemic hemodynamics in patients who developed residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. Inhaled PGI2 can be offered as alternative treatment option for residual pulmonary hypertension.

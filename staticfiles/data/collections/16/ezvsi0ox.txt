Data (attached) for a focused review and meta-analysis of cerebral levels of glutamate, Glx, and GABA levels assessed with 1H-MRS in high-risk of psychosis states was collected and stored at covidence.org and extracted to The Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager software package (RevMan Version 5.3) for meta-analytical purposes. Meta-analyses were performed with a random-effects, inverse-variance weighted model to calculate the pooled effect size. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 value. Significance was assessed using two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Potential publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots. Supplementary to the co-submitted article are comprehensive meta-analyses of glutamate, Glx, and GABA, as well as the PRISMA flow diagram of included studies and a list of studies included in the review along with available measures and methodological variables. The attached data offers an insight into the included studies and the specified metabolite values for each study and offers possible further investigation for other researchers, as well as an insight into the review and meta-analyses performed. The supplementary material also serves to support findings and interpretations in the main article.

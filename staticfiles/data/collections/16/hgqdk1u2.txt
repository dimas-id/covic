The psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt by people around the world. Persistent and disturbed thinking about the disease appears to be contributing to this mental health concern. Although the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument in the U.S., it has not been examined with in Pakistan. The current study addressed this problem by examining the validity of an Urdu translated version of the OCS using online survey data from 240 university students and teachers in Pakistan. The results showed that the OCS exhibited factorial validity, as well as measurement invariance for gender. However, the OCS also showed limited evidence of construct validity in terms of showing weak positive correlations with the total scale and social dysfunction and self-confidence subscales of the General Heath Questionnaire and no correlation with the depression and anxiety subscale (GHQ-12). These findings suggest that further research is necessary before the Urdu version of the OCS is widely adopted in Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the worth of a single-donor program for preterm infants through the recipient profile and the impact on donor exposure, red blood cell (RBC) pack waste, storage duration, and transfusion performance. STUDY DESIGN: Patients and transfusion characteristics were collected for 3 years (2015-2017) in preterm infants according to single-donor program prescription in a unit not practicing placental transfusion or erythropoietin supplementation. RESULTS: Among 1048 eligible preterm infants, 161 met the inclusion criteria, and 51 received single-donor packs. Our single-donor program induced a donor number reduction (34% less than the transfusion number) and an extension of storage duration (median: 9 versus 7 days, p < 0.0001) without altering the transfusion performance. However, 41% of small packs were not used. CONCLUSION: A single-donor program partially reduced donor exposure but led to drastic RBC pack waste. Optimization of transfusion alternatives may increase this phenomenon, calling into question the rationale of this practice.

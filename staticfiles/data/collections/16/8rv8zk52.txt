UNLABELLED The novel emerging coronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) binds to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), via 14 interacting amino acids. We previously showed that if the five interacting amino acids which differ between hamster and human DPP4 are changed to the residues found in human DPP4, hamster DPP4 does act as a receptor. Here, we show that the functionality of hamster DPP4 as a receptor is severely decreased if less than 4 out of 5 amino acids are changed. IMPORTANCE The novel emerging coronavirus MERS-CoV has infected >1,600 people worldwide, and the case fatality rate is âˆ¼36%. In this study, we show that by changing 4 amino acids in hamster DPP4, this protein functions as a receptor for MERS-CoV. This work is vital in the development of new small-animal models, which will broaden our understanding of MERS-CoV and be instrumental in the development of countermeasures.

The ongoing enigmatic COVID-19 outbreak, first reported from Wuhan, China, on last day of the year 2019, which has spread to 213 countries, territories/areas till 28th April 2020, threatens hundreds of thousands human souls. This devastating viral infection has stimulated the urgent development of viable vaccine against COVID-19 across the research institutes around the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also confirmed that the recent pandemic is causing Public Health Emergency of International apprehension. Moreover, the earlier two pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and many others yet to be identified pose a universal menace. Here, in this piece of work, we have utilized an in silico structural biology and advanced immunoinformatic strategies to devise a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against ongoing COVID-19 infection. The engineered vaccine sequence is adjuvanted with ÃŸ-3 defensin and comprised of B-cell epitopes, HTL epitopes and CTL epitopes. This is very likely that the vaccine will be able to elicit the strong immune response. Further, specific binding of the engineered vaccine and immune cell receptor TLR3 was estimated by molecular interaction studies. Strong interaction in the binding groove as well as good docking scores affirmed the stringency of engineered vaccine. The interaction is stable with minimal deviation in root-mean square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation was confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulation experiment. The immune-simulation by C-ImmSim server, which mimics the natural immune environment, yielded more potent immune response data of B-cells, Th cells, Tc cells and IgG for vaccine. The encouraging data obtained from the various in-silico works indicated this vaccine as an effective therapeutic against COVID-19.

Abstract Interest in the use of marmosets for experimental infectious disease has dramatically increased in the last decade. These animals are native to the Atlantic coastal forests in northeastern Brazil. The majority of experimental animals come from the National Primate Research Centers and other breeding facilities. They are advantageous because of their relative small size, weighting 350â€“400g as adults, their life span is compact compared with other nonhuman primate (NHP), and they produce offspring by 3years of age. They are free of Herpes B virus and, it is believed, to date, other dangerous human pathogens (Abbot et al., 2003) [1]. We describe here the experimental infections of marmosets to human pathogens. While it is always interesting to compare various NHPs with each other, the importance of an animal model is always in comparing its similarities to human infections.

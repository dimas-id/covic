Acute maxillary sinusitis is a common condition requiring broad-spectrum therapy to prevent development of chronic disease. A randomised, double-blind, multicentre study was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of cefuroxime axetil 250 mg twice daily (n = 185) and clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily (n = 185), both administered for 10 days, in the treatment of patients with acute sinusitis. Efficacy was determined by assessment of clinical response at post-treatment and follow-up, and by radiological assessment at pre-treatment and follow-up. Assessment of days absent from work due to illness was also made. In the cefuroxime axetil group, 169/185 (91%) patients were cured/improved at post-treatment, as were 172/185 (93%) patients receiving clarithromycin and, of these, 137/169 (81%) and 143/172 (83%) maintained their response at follow-up. Follow-up radiography showed a reduction in incidence of air fluid level and/or opacification from 96% to 15% (cefuroxime axetil) and from 96% to 11% (clarithromycin), and a decrease in frequency of mucosal thickening from 58% to 28% (cefuroxime axetil) and from 56% to 29% (clarithromycin). Only 10% of patients in either group experienced adverse events and days absent from work were comparable. This study demonstrated clinical equivalence between twice-daily cefuroxime axetil and clarithromycin, both treatments being effective and well tolerated.

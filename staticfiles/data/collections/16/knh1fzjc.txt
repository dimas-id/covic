This chapter first reviews a series of curricular reforms of science education in Hong Kong that started at the turn of the 21st Century. It moves on to share the decade of efforts in promoting teachersâ€™ learning and their subsequent teaching of the nature of science (NOS). Among these efforts, two teacher professional development programmes received overwhelmingly positive views from teachers in terms of developing their understanding about NOS and scientists. Both programmes provided teachers with special encounters with world-renowned local scientists.

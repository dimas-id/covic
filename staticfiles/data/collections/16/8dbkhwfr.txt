We describe an enhanced endovascular procedure for the coiling of broad-necked basilar terminal aneurysms with a combined balloon/stent assist technique. A balloon-assisted catheter is inserted in the origin of one posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and an assisted stent is deployed from the opposite PCA to the basilar artery. A microcatheter for coiling is inserted through the stent strut (trans-cell approach), and the aneurysm is coiled under stent support and assisted balloon inflation to keep the patency of both PCAs. This technique is more beneficial for reducing the risk of stent deformity than Y-stenting, and it provides a simpler procedure than other advanced stent techniques. Additionally, it enables an easy approach when retreatment is necessary for aneurysm recurrence. This technique may be one of the useful procedures for embolizing broad-necked basilar terminal aneurysms safely and effectively.

Transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in schools is unknown. Our investigations especially in pre-schools could not detect SARS-CoV-2 transmission despite screening of symptomatic and asymptomatic children. The data suggests that children are not the primary drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools and could help inform exit strategies for lifting of lockdowns.

Commonly used drugs for treating many conditions are either natural products or derivatives. In silico modelling has identified several natural products including quercetin as potential highly effective disruptors of the initial infection process involving binding to the interface between the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) Viral Spike Protein and the epithelial cell Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein. Here we argue that the oral route of administration of quercetin is unlikely to be effective in clinical trials owing to biotransformation during digestion, absorption and metabolism, but suggest that agents could be administered directly by alternative routes such as a nasal or throat spray.

BackgroundFrom March 2-April 12, 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced exponential growth of the COVID-19 pandemic due to novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians.MethodsIRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020.ResultsFrom an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with an additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). 80% of programs reported quarantining a resident. 90/91 programs reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts.ConclusionMany resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs. Infection risk may differ by specialty.FundingAHA, MPB, RWSC, CGM, LRDG, JDH: NEI Core Grant P30EY019007, RPB Unrestricted Grant. ACP and JS: Parker Family Chair. SXX: University of Pennsylvania.

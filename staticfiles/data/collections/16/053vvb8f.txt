OBJECTIVES In this study, we report long-term outcomes of high-risk, high-BMI (body mass index) patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). BACKGROUND Short- and medium-term data appear to support the effectiveness of LSG, but long-term data to support its durability are sparse. METHODS A prospective database was reviewed on all high-risk patients who underwent LSG as part of a staged approach for surgical treatment of severe obesity between January 2002 and February 2004. We included only patients who did not proceed to second-stage surgery (gastric bypass). Analyzed data included demographics, BMI, comorbidities, and surgical outcomes. All partial gastrectomies were performed using a 50F bougie. RESULTS Seventy-four patients underwent LSG, and follow-up data were available on 69 of 74 patients (93%). The mean age was 50 years (25-78) and the mean number of co-morbidities was 9.6. Perioperative mortality (<30 days) was zero, and the incidence of short- and long-term postoperative complications was 15%. The mean overall follow-up time period was 73 months (38-95). Mean excess weight loss (EWL) at 72, 84, and 96 months after LSG was 52%, 43%, and 46%, respectively, with an overall EWL of 48%. The mean BMI decreased from 66 kg/m(2) (43-90) to 46 kg/m(2) (22-73). Seventy-seven percent of the diabetic patients showed improvement or remission of the disease. CONCLUSIONS This study reports the longest follow-up of LSG patients thus far and supports the effectiveness, safety, and durability of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as a definitive therapeutic option for severe obesity, even in high-risk, high-BMI patients.

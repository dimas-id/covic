Obturator hernia is a rare pelvic hernia that occurs primarily in multiparous, elderly (>70 years of age), thin females. This case highlights the successful laparoscopic mesh repair of an incarcerated obturator hernia in an octogenarian. The authors report a case of an incarcerated obturator hernia in an elderly female with subsequent high-grade small bowel and its successful laparoscopic operative management. A review of the relevant literature was also performed following a search on the online literature databases such as PUBMED and EMBASE. Laparoscopic mesh repair of the incarcerated obturator hernia and an ipsilateral femoral hernia found incidentally was successfully performed. A review of the literature showed a significant burden of morbidity and mortality associated with obturator hernias. Laparoscopic mesh repair has been previously shown to be a safe therapeutic modality. Small bowel obstruction and leg pain in a thin elderly lady should arouse suspicion for an incarcerated obturator hernia. Laparoscopic management of an incarcerated obturator hernia is a feasible and safe therapeutic option.

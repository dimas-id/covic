OBJECTIVE To synthesize evidence from qualitative studies relating to adolescent girls' perceptions of physical activity participation. The protocol for this review is registered with PROSPERO (ID no. CRD42017054944). DATA SOURCE PubMed, Sports Discus, Academic Search Complete, and Education Resources Information Centre. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Studies reporting qualitative data that explored the views/opinions/perceptions of adolescent girls (>12 and <18 years old) published between 2001 and 2016 were included. Studies not in English, those focusing on school physical education or specific sports, and those including special populations were excluded. EXTRACTION Study characteristics and results were extracted to a form developed by the authors and managed using NVivo 10 (QSR International's NVivo 10 software). Data were extracted by 1 reviewer, and a sample (25%) was checked by a second reviewer. SYNTHESIS Data were synthesized using a thematic network and managed using NVivo 10. The validity of the included studies was assessed using the "Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (2018)" checklist. The ENTREQ and PRISMA statement was followed when reporting this qualitative synthesis. RESULTS Of the 1818 studies identified in the search strategy, 24 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Global themes were identified using a thematic network. These themes were "Gender Bias in Sport," "Motivation and Perceived Competence," "Competing Priorities during Adolescence," and "Meeting Societal Expectations." CONCLUSIONS The results of this review provide insights into adolescent girls' views on physical activity. Future research is needed to investigate the potential impact of alternative activity programs on adolescent girls with appropriate follow-up. Researchers and individuals working with young girls must consider the role of perceived motor competence in participation and how this can impact their perceptions.

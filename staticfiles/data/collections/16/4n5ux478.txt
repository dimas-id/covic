Many physicians care for patients who remain in the hospital for prolonged periods despite being ‘medical ready’ or stable for discharge. However, this phenomenon is not well defined and optimal strategies to address the problem are not known. A prolonged hospitalization past the point of medically necessity can harm patients, frustrate care teams, and is costly for the healthcare system. In this perspective, we describe opportunities to improve value of care for these patients through the lens of the Quadruple Aim, a common framework used to guide healthcare transformation efforts. We then offer recommendations, including some employed by our hospitals, for clinicians, researchers, and healthcare systems to improve the care for patients who are “stuck” in the hospital.

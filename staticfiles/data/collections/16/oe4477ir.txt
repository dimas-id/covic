Thalidomide was used in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a sedative for morning sickness in pregnant women. It resulted in thousands of babies being born with various congenital anomalies, such as phocomelia. Subsequently, the drug was banned for this indication. Most of the survivors have become thalidomide adults and now they are in their fifties. We report the first case of a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in a 54-year-old male with prostate cancer and phocomelia as a result of thalidomide embryopathy. He presented with a PSA of 3.3 and was diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer. An extra peritoneal approach was chosen due to his body habitus and to avoid extreme Trendelenburg tilt. Side docking with the da Vinci robot was employed and the prostatectomy was carried out in the standard extra peritoneal fashion. At 6 months' follow-up his PSA is unrecordable and he is voiding well with minimal urinary incontinence, requiring 1 pad/day. We aim to outline our approach and highlight the technical modifications in this rare physically disabling condition.

OBJECTIVE: Chest CT is useful in assessing the disease course of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) This study aims to identify the characteristics of patients in whom imaging progression occurred while clinical symptoms were relieved and to guide radiological reexamination METHODS: This retrospective study included 73 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection All patients received CT reexaminations within 24 h after symptomatic remission We divided patients into two groups according to the matching degree between clinical and imaging outcomes RESULTS: 21 patients displayed imaging progression while symptoms relieved Patients with imaging progression were prone to be advanced in age [years: 60 (46–65) v 47 (37–60 75), P = 0 030];lymphopenia (66 7% v 40 4%, P = 0 042) and low level of C-reactive protein [mg/L: 5 7 (1 9–20 2) v 18 9 (6 7–38 9), P = 0 038] An age over 50 was an independent risk factor for imaging progression (OR = 3 41, 95%CI 1 14–10 20, P = 0 028) In CT images, they were inclined to present lesions with clear border (94 7% v 64 7%, P = 0 012), pure peripheral distribution (89 5% v 39 2%, P 0 001), without bilateral lungs involved (57 9% v 29 4%, P = 0 028) especially with left lung involved only (42 1% v 17 6%, P = 0 034) CONCLUSION: In order to improve the therapeutic effect, the interval before radiological follow-up should be shortened appropriately especially in patients over the age of 50 It is essential to proceed to CT reexamination before symptomatic remission

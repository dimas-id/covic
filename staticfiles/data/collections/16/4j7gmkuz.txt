We and agree with Drs Lim and Tey on the need to exclude varicella in vesicular eruptions in patients with COVID‐19, as this diagnosis has important implications. Once that it is established that some patients with COVID‐19 can have a vesicular eruption, there is a need to further characterize this group of patients. The link of some of these lesions with herpesvirus infections is very likely. One patient was excluded from our study with a diagnosis of varicella or disseminated herpes zoster.

The study of mortality and the calculation of excess deaths is a fundamental tool for understanding the effect of epidemics / pandemics and the seasonal cycles of endemic / epidemic diseases such as influenza, which is of great importance in times of crisis, according to the WHO and different authors. In this study, we analyzed the indicator of excess deaths in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simultaneously, research is being carried out to corroborate and characterize possible causes of the underestimation of deaths by official health agencies.

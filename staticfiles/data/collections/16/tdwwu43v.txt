This paper presents a collaborative semantic tracking framework based on topic maps which aims to integrate and organize the data/information resources that spread throughout the Internet in the manner that makes them useful for tracking events such as natural disaster, and disease dispersion. We present the architecture we defined in order to support highly relevant semantic management and to provide adaptive services such as statistical information extraction technique for document summarization. In addition, this paper also carries out a case study on disease dispersion domain using the proposed framework.

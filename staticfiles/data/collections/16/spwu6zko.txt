We introduce new proof systems for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) by enhancing Q-resolution systems with rules which exploit local and global symmetries. The rules are based on homomorphisms that admit non-injective mappings between literals. This results in systems that are stronger than Q-resolution with (injective) symmetry rules. We further strengthen the systems by utilizing a dependency system D in a way that surpasses Q(D)-resolution in relative strength.

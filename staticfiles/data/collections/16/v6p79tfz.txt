After finding the first cases in Italy, the Government declared a state of emergency. In The Lancet, Stefano Spina and colleagues (1) reported the strategy of the Emergency Medical System (EMS) of the metropolitan area of Milan to contrast the recent COVID‚Äê19 outbreak in Italy. The EMS instituted a team that manages the patients and their flow to local hospitals. This response is critical, given the public health problem and the need to avoid the Emergency Department overcrowding.

Abstract Real time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is now used commonly for the detection of viral pathogens in respiratory samples. However, due to potential inhibition of the RT-PCR or inefficient extraction, this sample type can present significant challenges to accurate patient testing. The goal of this study was to create an internal control to be multiplexed in a real time RT-PCR assay for detecting a viral target in respiratory samples. This report describes an Armored RNA (aRNA) internal control developed originally to be multiplexed in a real time RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS-associated Coronavirus, but can be incorporated into any RT-PCR assay. The internal control primers and probe target a region in the coat protein gene of the E. coli F-specific bacteriophage ms2, which is contained within the aRNA.

BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of scalp nerve block (SNB) and local anesthetic infiltration (LA) with 0.75% ropivacaine on postoperative inflammatory response, intraoperative hemodynamic response, and postoperative pain control in patients undergoing craniotomy. METHODS Fifty-seven patients were admitted for elective craniotomy for surgical clipping of a cerebral aneurysm. They were randomly divided into three groups: Group S (SNB with 15 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine), group I (LA with 15 mL of 0.75% ropivacaine) and group C (that only received routine intravenous analgesia). Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in plasma for 72 h postoperatively, hemodynamic response to skin incision, and postoperative pain intensity were measured. RESULTS The SNB with 0.75% ropivacaine not only decreased IL-6 levels in plasma 6 h after craniotomy but also decreased plasma CRP levels and increased plasma IL-10 levels 12 and 24 h after surgery compared to LA and routine analgesia. There were significant increases in mean arterial pressure 2 and 5 mins after the incision and during dura opening in Groups I and C compared with Group S. Group S had lower postoperative pain intensity, longer duration before the first dose of oxycodone, less consumption of oxycodone and lower incidence of PONV through 48 h postoperatively than Groups I and C. CONCLUSION Preoperative SNB attenuated inflammatory response to craniotomy for cerebral aneurysms, blunted the hemodynamic response to scalp incision, and controlled postoperative pain better than LA or routine analgesia.

Purpose Due to the emergence of the new coronavirus 2019 and the lack of sufficient information about infected patients, this study was conducted to investigate the chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings of patients infected with the new coronavirus 2019 Methods This cross-sectional study was performed on COVID-19 patients referred to Medical Imaging Centers of Sari, Mazandaran, Iran, on March 2020 for computed tomography (CT) scan Symptomatic patients were referred to the Medical Imaging Center for diagnosis confirmation through CT scan In addition to age and sex, HRCT findings were collected from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) for further evaluations Results Out of 552 patients with mean age of 51 2 Â± 14 8 years, the male/female ratio was 1 38 to 1 The most common expressive findings in patients were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (87 3%), peripheral distribution (82 4%), and posterior distribution (81 5%) The most conflicting findings in patients were pleural effusion (7 6%), peribronchovascular distribution (7 6%), and lymphadenopathy (5 1%) The peripheral distribution (p = 0 034), round opacities (p = 0 02), single lobe (p = 0 003), and pleural effusion (p = 0 037) were significant in people under and over 50 years of age Conclusion In summary, the present study indicated that in addition to GGO, peripheral distribution findings could be a vital diagnostic choice in COVID-19 patients

BACKGROUND The quest for less traumatic abdominal approaches is changing paradigms in times of minimally invasive surgery. While natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery remains experimental, the single-incision approach could be the future of gallbladder surgery. METHODS Prospectively collected data from 875 patients subjected to conventional single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) or 4-port [laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)] were retrospectively analyzed and discussed with the current literature. RESULTS Between 2008 and 2011, 201 (23%) SILCs and 674 (77%) LCs were performed. Mean age was 51.7±17.5 years (SILC: 45.1 vs. LC: 53.7 y). Patients were predominantly female (SILC: 75.1% vs. LC: 56.5%). Preoperative body mass index was 27.4±9.1 (SILC: 26.4 vs. LC: 27.8; P<0.05) and American Society of Anesthesiologists' score counted 1.67±0.57 in SILC and 1.86±0.7 in LC patients. Acute inflammation of the gallbladder (AIG) was not considered as a contraindication for SILC (AIG in SILC: 17.4% vs. LC: 35.5%). The mean operative time was significantly lower in the SILC group (SILC: 71±31 vs. LC: 79±27 min) and duration of postoperative hospital stay was shorter (SILC: 3.2±1.7 vs. LC: 4.5±2.6 d). No significant difference was observed between SILC and LC in any of the registered complications, including postoperative bleeding, trocar hernias, wound infection, abdominal abscess formation, bile duct injury, or cystic duct leakage. CONCLUSIONS In the near future SILC could overrule conventional LC as the leading technique for gallbladder surgery. Our data reconfirm an excellent risk profile for SILC that is equal to that of LC. Large multicenter randomized controlled trials will be required to finally legitimize SILC as the succeeding principal method.

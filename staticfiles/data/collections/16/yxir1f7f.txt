Ultrasound imaging is a safe, low-cost, and in situ method for detecting in vivo medical devices. A poly(methyl-2-cyanoacrylate) film containing 2 Î¼m boron-doped, calcined, porous silica microshells was developed as an ultrasound imaging marker for multiple medical devices. A macrophase separation drove the gas-filled porous silica microshells to the top surface of the polymer film by controlled curing of the cyanoacrylate glue and the amount of microshell loading. A thin film of polymer blocked the wall pores of the microshells to seal air in their hollow core, which served as an ultrasound contrast agent. The ultrasound activity disappeared when curing conditions were modified to prevent the macrophase segregation. Phase segregated films were attached to multiple surgical tools and needles and gave strong color Doppler signals in vitro and in vivo with the use of a clinical ultrasound imaging instrument. Postprocessing of the simultaneous color Doppler and B-mode images can be used for autonomous identification of implanted surgical items by correlating the two images. The thin films were also hydrophobic, thereby extending the lifetime of ultrasound signals to hours of imaging in tissues by preventing liquid penetration. This technology can be used as a coating to guide the placement of implantable medical devices or used to image and help remove retained surgical items.

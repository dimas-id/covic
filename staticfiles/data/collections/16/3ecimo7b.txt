Background One-lung ventilation (OLV) is becoming an essential component of thoracic anesthesia. The two principal devices used for OLV are a double-lumen tube (DLT) and a bronchial blocker (BB). We hypothesized that the use of a BB with the disconnection technique would improve the quality of lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods Seventy-five patients undergoing scheduled VATS were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups: a left-sided DLT group (Group D) and a BB with the disconnection technique group (Group B). OLV was initiated when the surgeon performed the skin incision. In Group D, the left channel of the DLT was opened to the air. In Group B, the lung was deflated via the disconnection technique, thus opening the breathing circuit to the air fifteen seconds after opening the pleura. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during induction; the quality of lung collapse 1 and 10 minutes after pleural opening; the time required for complete lung collapse; the correct placement of the device; and the number of patients suffering from a sore throat after surgery were recorded. Results Compared with the use of the DLT, the use of the BB with the disconnection technique was associated with a similar quality of lung collapse, a comparable required time for total lung collapse (P>0.05, respectively), a lower incidence of sore throat both when leaving the PACU and 24 hours after surgery (34.2% vs. 13.5%, 15.8% vs. 5.4%, P<0.05, respectively) and fewer hemodynamic fluctuations after intubation both one and ten minutes after pleural opening. Conclusions The use of a BB with the disconnection technique in VATS offers an effective method for improving the quality of lung collapse and reducing postoperative sore throat.

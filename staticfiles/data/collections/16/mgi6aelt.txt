Successful vaccine development remains a huge challenge for infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV and influenza. As a novel way to present antigenic epitopes to the immune system, we have developed icosahedral self-assembling protein nanoparticles (SAPNs) to serve as a prototypical vaccine platform for infectious diseases. Here we examine some biophysical factors that affect the self-assembly of these nanoparticles, which have as basic building blocks coiled-coil oligomerization domains joined by a short linker region. Relying on in silico computer modeling predictions, we selected five different linker regions from the RCSB protein database that connect oligomerization domains, and then further studied the self-assembly and stability of in vitro produced nanoparticles through biophysical characterization of formed particles. One design in particular, T2i88, revealed excellent self-assembly and homogeneity thus paving the way towards a more optimized nanoparticle for vaccine applications.

Abstract Subgenomic mRNA from a virulent field isolate of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), strain FS772/70, was used to produce cDNA. The cDNA from three overlapping clones was sequenced by the chain termination method and two open reading frames (ORFs) were identified. The largest ORF, 4350bp, encoded a polypeptide of 1449 amino acids of relative molecular mass (Mr) 159811, which contained 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a cysteine-rich region, and a potential transmembrane region. The C-terminal half of this ORF showed homology to the S proteins of four other coronaviruses. The other ORF consisted of the 3'-end of a gene with homology to the carboxyl terminus of the F2 subunit of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA polymerase.

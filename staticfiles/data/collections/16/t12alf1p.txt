Anosmia associated or not with dysgeusia seems to be a frequent symptom in cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. It can be the initial symptom of the disease or remain isolated in pauci-symptomatic patients. Waiting for scientific confirmation and in the context of the current pandemic, it seems essential to consider any patient with a new anosmia as being infected with SARS-CoV-2 until proven otherwise. These patients should therefore isolate themselves and remain alert to the occurrence of other symptoms suggestive of the infection and/or be tested. Topical and systemic corticosteroids and nose washes are contraindicated. The natural course of anosmia seems to be favorable in most cases.

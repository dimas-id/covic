Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) specific for the E1 and E2 surface glycoproteins of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine were examined either alone or in combination to evaluate their potential value in protecting neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. Cesarean-delivered colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets were given one pre-challenge dose of Mab and an equal dose of the same Mab at each successive feeding after challenge. In vivo challenge results demonstrated that neither Mabs given individually nor combinations of the Mabs were able to protect neonatal pigs against a lethal dose of TGEV. However, in parallel experiments, polyclonal antibodies from immune colostrum or serum were protective.

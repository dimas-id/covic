Viral zoonoses have represented a significant public health problem throughout history, affecting all continents. Furthermore, many viral zoonoses have emerged or reemerged in recent years, highlighting the importance of such diseases. Emerging viral zoonoses encompass a vast number of different viruses and many different transmission modes. There are many factors influencing the epidemiology of the various zoonoses, such as ecological changes, changes in agriculture and food production, the movement of pathogens, including via travel and trade, human behavior and demographical factors, and microbial changes and adaptation. Cost-effective prevention and control of emerging viral zoonoses necessitates an interdisciplinary and holistic approach and international cooperation. Surveillance, laboratory capability, research, training and education, and last but not least, information and communication are key elements.

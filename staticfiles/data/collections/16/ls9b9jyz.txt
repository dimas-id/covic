BACKGROUND Despite policies for universal HIV testing and treatment (UTT) regardless of CD4 count, there are still 1.8 million new HIV infections and 1 million AIDS-related deaths annually. The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals target suppression of HIV viral load in 73% of all HIV-infected people worldwide by 2030. However, achieving these targets may not lead to expected reductions in HIV incidence if the remaining 27% (persons with unsuppressed viral load) are the drivers of HIV transmission through high-risk behaviors. We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the demographics, mobility, geographic distribution, and risk profile of adults who are not virologically suppressed in sub-Saharan Africa in the era of UTT. METHODS We will review the published and grey literature for study sources that contain data on demographic and behavioral strata of virologically suppressed and unsuppressed populations since 2014. We will search PubMed and Embase using four sets of search terms tailored to identify characteristics associated with virological suppression (or lack thereof) and each of the individual 90-90-90 goals. Record screening and data abstraction will be done independently and in duplicate. We will use random effects meta-regression analyses to estimate the distribution of demographic and risk features among groups not virologically suppressed and for each individual 90-90-90 goal. DISCUSSION The results of our review will help elucidate factors associated with failure to achieve virological suppression in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as factors associated with failure to achieve each of the 90-90-90 goals. These data will help quantify the population-level effects of current HIV treatment interventions to improve strategies for maximizing virological suppression and ending the HIV epidemic.

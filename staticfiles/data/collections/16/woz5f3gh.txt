These past months of the COVID pandemic have given us ample opportunity to reflect on the US health care system. Despite overwhelming tragedy, it is an opportunity for us to learn and to change. As we postpone routine visits because of the pandemic, we worry about risks for patients who delay cancer screening. We use cervical cancer screening and prevention as an example of how we can use some "lessons learned" from the pandemic to prevent "collateral losses," such as an increase in cancers. COVID-related health system changes, like the more rapid evaluation of diagnostic tests and vaccines, the transition to compensated virtual care for most counseling and education visits, and broadened access to home services all offer potential benefits to the delivery of cervical cancer screening and prevention. While we detail the case for cervical cancer prevention, many of the issues discussed are generalizable to other preventative measures. It would be a tragedy if the morbidity and mortality of COVID is multiplied because of additional suffering caused by delayed or deferred cancer screening and diagnostic evaluation-but maybe with creativity and reflection, we can use this pandemic to improve care.

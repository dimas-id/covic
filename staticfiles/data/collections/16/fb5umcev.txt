This review explores the recent advances that have been made in our understanding of host viral interactions in the intestine. Technical advances have allowed the initial definition of intestinal viromes in a number of species including humans. Important advances in our knowledge of the host response to viral infection have shown that interferon lambda has a role that is unique from type I interferons in the intestine. Lastly, our understanding of virally induced phenotypes has expanded through new studies that show bacteria can play an important role in the outcome of viral infection in the intestine.

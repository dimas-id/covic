The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is responsible for a pandemic that is causing thousands of deaths worldwide. The virus can be transmitted from person to person, directly or indirectly, via the respiratory, oro‐fecal and probably sexual routes.(1) The eventual vertical transmission route is still poorly explored. However, mother‐to‐child SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission through the placenta probably does not occur, or likely occurs very rarely.(2) All the studies conducted on COVID‐19 pregnant women involved patients undergoing cesarean section, but the indications for such delivery modality were not clearly stated.

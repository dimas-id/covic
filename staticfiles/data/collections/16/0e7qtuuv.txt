The analysis, prevention, and removal of microplastics (MPs) pollution in water is identified as one major problem the world is currently facing. MPs can be directly released to water or formed by the degradation of bigger plastics. Nowadays, it is estimated that annually between 4 and 12 million tonnes of plastic go into the seas and oceans-with a forecast for them to outweigh the amount of fish in 2050. Based on the existing studies, the characterization of MPs in waters is still one of the remaining challenges because they can be easily confused with organic or other types of matter. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to establish pathways for the chemical identification of the MP nature. In this perspective, the recent techniques and instrumentation for MP characterization (Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies and microscopies, pyrolysis and thermal desorption gas chromatography, imaging techniques, etc.) are discussed including considerations to the multidimensionality of the problem. This perspective also summarizes and provides updated data on the sources and occurrence, transport and fate of MPs in aquatic ecosystems, as well as influencing conditions and factors affecting dispersal. Additionally, how engineering and biotechnological tools, such as advanced water treatments, would help to control, reduce, or even eliminate MP pollution in the near future is outlined.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is the third zoonotic coronavirus to be identified in humans during the twenty‐first century, after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV)(Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy,of Viruses, 2020). The resultant disease, Coronavirus Disease (COVID‐19) (WHO, 2020), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (WHO, 2020) and rapidly evolved into a pandemic (WHO, 2020) within months. In the UK, the first confirmed case was identified in late January 2020 and the first COVID‐19 related death was recorded in March 2020 (UK Government, 2020).

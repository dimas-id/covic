Summary The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a nucleic acid-based technique that enables the rapid and sensitive detection of specific micro-organisms. Although this technique is widely used in veterinary research, it has not yet found applications in routine microbiological analysis of veterinary clinical samples. However, advances in sample preparation together with the increasing availability of specific gene sequences will probably lead to the more widespread diagnostic use of PCR in the future. PCR is likely to have a strong impact in the epidemiology, treatment and prevention of animal infectious diseases.

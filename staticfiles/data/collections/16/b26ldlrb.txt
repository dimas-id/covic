Abstract A 48kDa, chitin-binding lectin with antifungal, antiviral and apoptosis-inducing activities was isolated from the rhizomes of Setcreasea purpurea Boom, a member of family Commelinaceae. Setcreasea purpurea lectin (designated as SPL) is a homotetrameric protein consisting of 12031.9Da subunits linked by non-covalent bonds as determined by SDS-PAGE, gel filtration and MS. The N-terminal 25 amino-acid sequence of SPL, NVLGRDAYCGSQNPGATCPGLCCSK was determined and homology analysis suggested that SPL belongs to the family of chitin-binding plant lectins composed of hevein domains. The lectin exhibited strong hemagglutinating activity towards rabbit erythrocytes at 0.95μg/ml and the activity could be reversed exclusively by chitin hydrolysate (oligomers of GlcNAc). Its hemagglutinating activity was stable in pH range of 2.0–9.0 and it showed excellent thermal tolerance. SPL showed antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Penicillium italicum and Helminthosporiun maydis. It also exhibited inhibitory effect on HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (ROD), with an EC50 of 13.8±1.3 and 57.1±15μg/ml, respectively. Subsequently, MTT method, cell morphological analysis and LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that SPL was highly cytotoxic to CNE-1 cells and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, due to the caspase inhibitors analyses, caspase was also found to play an important role in the potential apoptotic mechanism of SPL.

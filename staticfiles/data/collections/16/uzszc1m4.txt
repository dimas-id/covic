Cerebral Oximetry by Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used in cardiovascular anesthesia, but there was no guideline of regional cerebral oxygen saturation measured by cerebral oximetry by NIRS. This guideline provides recommendations applicable to patients at a risk of developing cerebral ischemia in cardiovascular surgery. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment. The Japanese Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (JSCVA) Task Force on Guidelines make an effort to ensure that the guideline writing committee contains broad views in using cerebral oximetry. Adherence to recommendations could be enhanced by shared decision making between healthcare providers and patients. This guideline was focused on cerebral oximetry of pediatric and adult cardiovascular disease. We hope this guideline would play an important role in using cerebral oximetry by measured NIRS.

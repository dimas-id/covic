BACKGROUND Pressure sores are a significant problem in the healthcare sector. Although they may cause considerable morbidity, they are preventable. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate the electrical properties of a tissue close to and away from the pressure sore site, and (2) establish a new approach for objective, reliable, low-cost and noninvasive screening or detection of pressure sore in its early stage. STUDY DESIGN Randomised controlled trial. METHODS Fifteen patients participated in this study. They all had stage I or stage II sacral pressure sores. Tiny surface electrodes in four-electrode configuration were used for all tissue electrical properties measurements recorded over the frequency range of 30-10 MHz. RESULTS Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed that all measurements (ICC > 0.90 for all measurements) had good reliability and validity. The real part of impedance (R) and the imaginary part of impedance (X) of a tissue measured close to the pressure sore site was found to be significantly smaller (p < 0.05 in all cases) than that measured away from the pressure sore site at a specific frequency range (R: 30.00-38.55 Hz; X: 43.95-606.40 Hz). It was also found that the extracellular resistance (R(e)) and the ratio of extracellular resistance to intracellular resistance (R(e)/R(i)) of a tissue measured close to the pressure sore site were significantly smaller (p < 0.05 in all cases) than that measured away from the pressure sore site. CONCLUSIONS Since the electrical properties (R, X, R(e), R(e)/R(i) ) of a tissue close to, and away from, the pressure sore site can be significantly distinguished, a potentially promising method for the screening of pressure sores at an early stage has been proposed.

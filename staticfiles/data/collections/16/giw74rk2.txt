Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor and the most malignant type of glioma is glioblastoma with the character of high mortality, high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. MicroRNAs act as an important component in glioma development and thus may be a potential target for the treatment of glioma. There were some researches indicated that miR-210-3p played a role in glioma development, but if it can inhibit glioma growth, as well as the underlying mechanism, is still uncertain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of miR-210-3p and its potential target gene Iscu on glioma (C6) cells proliferation and migration in vitro as well as the influence of miR-210-3p on glioma growth in vivo. The results showed that miR-210-3p inhibited the proliferation and migration of C6 cells by regulating the expression of its target gene Iscu in vitro. We also demonstrated that glioma growth was suppressed in immunodeficient mice when they were implanted with C6 cells overexpressing miR-210-3p. Our data indicated that miR-210-3p played an important role in the prevention of glioma growth by targeting Iscu and so miR-210-3p/Iscu axis might be a potential target for the treatment of glioma.

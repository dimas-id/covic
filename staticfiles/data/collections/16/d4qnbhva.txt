The COVID‐19 pandemic has spread to 185 countries with over 2.1 million confirmed cases and 145,000 deaths, as per the Johns Hopkins University COVID‐19 dashboard provided at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html. Imaging modalities such as chest radiography, thoracic and cardiovascular ultrasound, and computed tomography have roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and therapy of COVID‐19. However, the potential benefits of imaging need to be balanced against resource utilization and infectious risk.

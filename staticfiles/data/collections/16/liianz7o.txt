The pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus is associated with significant mortality. Targeting S1PR1, which is known to modulate the immune response, provides protection against pathogenic influenza virus. The functional role and molecular mechanism of S1PR1 were analysed by generating inducible endothelial cell-specific S1PR1 knockout mice and assessing the therapeutic efficacy of the selective S1PR1 agonist CYM5442 against acute lung injury (ALI) induced by the 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus. Immune-mediated pulmonary injury is aggravated by the absence of endothelial S1PR1 and alleviated by treatment with CYM-5442, suggesting a protective function of S1PR1 signaling during H1N1 infection. S1PR1 signaling does not affect viral clearance in mice infected with influenza. Mechanistically, the MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways are involved in the ALI mediated by S1PR1 in infected mice. Combined administration of the S1PR1 agonist CYM-5442 and the antiviral drug oseltamivir provides maximum protection from ALI. Our current study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of S1PR1 mediating the ALI induced by H1N1 infection and indicates that the combination of S1PR1 agonist with antiviral drug could potentially be used as a therapeutic remedy for future H1N1 virus pandemics.

BACKGROUND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has recently been authorized for use in older patients. The objective of this single-center study was to evaluate 2-year weight loss in patients ≥60 years compared with younger matched patients undergoing RYGB. Secondary aims were to record complications and the resolution of comorbidities in a 2-year follow-up. METHODS Of 722 patients with at least 2 years follow-up data, 48 elderly patients were matched with 92 young (<40 years) and 96 middle-aged (40-59 year) patients, according to sex, baseline body mass index, and date of surgery. Weight loss, remission of comorbidities, death, and early (30-day) and 2-year complication rates were compared. RESULTS There were three deaths in the elderly group and none in the other groups. The early complication rate was not significantly different in the elderly group (17.8 %) compared with the young (11.5 %, p = 0.637) and middle-aged (13.7 %, p = 1.000) groups. The 2-year complication rates were not significantly different in the elderly group (9.3 %) compared with the young (23.5 %, p = 0.107) and middle-aged (13.2 %, p = 1.000) groups. The 2-year weight loss was lower in the elderly group (31.8 ± 7.2 %; p < 0.001) than in the young group (38.3 ± 6.9 %) but was not significantly different from that in the middle-aged group (34.4 ± 8.0 %; p = 0.145). Remission rates for diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea were lower in the elderly than in the two younger groups. CONCLUSION After bariatric surgery, major weight loss was observed in patients older than 60, but remission of metabolic comorbidities was less marked than in younger subjects.

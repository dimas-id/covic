In this paper we explore how Kinect body posture sensors can be used to detect group collaboration and learning, in the context of dyad pairs using augmented reality system. We leverage data collected during a study (N = 60 dyads) where participant pairs learned about electromagnetism. Using unsupervised machine learning methods on Kinect body posture sensor data, we contribute a set of dyad states associated with collaboration quality, attitudes toward physics and learning gains.

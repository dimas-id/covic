OBJECTIVES To investigate the enteropathogens in children with diarrhea attending Salmaniya Medical Complex, Bahrain. METHODS Fecal samples from 805 children up to 15 years were examined for parasites, ova and cysts by direct wet preparation, formol-ether concentration and modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain, during the period November 1998 through to June 2000. Samples were cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on the relevant clinical isolates by agar disk diffusion method. All stools from children below 3 years of age (653 samples) were processed for adenovirus and rotavirus using a commercially available latex agglutination test (Diarlex). In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed on 200 randomly selected samples using oligonucleotide primers for Rotavirus A, B and C. RESULTS Four subjects were found positive for parasites. Eighty-three (10.3%) samples were found positive for Salmonella (46 isolates), Shigella (26 isolates), Campylobacter jejuni (7 isolates), and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (4 isolates). Rotavirus was found in 91 (13.9%) samples and 4 samples (0.6%) were found positive for adenovirus. Out of 200 samples examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, 73 (36.5%) were positive for group A rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS Rotavirus type A appeared to be the most common single agent in our pediatric population, followed by the classical bacterial pathogens. Adenovirus and parasites appeared to play a very minor role in diarrhea. Thus, we suggest the introduction of rotavirus diagnostic tests in microbiological examination of diarrheic stools of children below 3 years of age.

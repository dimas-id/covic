After the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002, legal theorist David Fidler diagnosed the arrival of the ‘first post-Westphalian pathogen’. The coinage indicates that the spread of infectious disease transforms the spatial coordinates of the modern political environment. This article analyses this transformation by asking how the legal regime, designed to prepare for the pandemic, envisions the globe as an object of government. It demonstrates that the WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR) articulate a space of global circulation that exhibits two features. First, the infrastructures of microbial traffic become the primary matters of concern. The IHR do not focus on human life so much as they aim at securing transnational mobilities. Second, the IHR circumscribe a space that is fragmented by zones of intensified governmental control at transportational nodal points, such as airports and harbours. In these zones, technologies of screening and quarantine are applied to modulate the connectivity of people, organic matter and things. As a whole, the article investigates how processes of de- and re-territorialisation interact in the context of global health security. In analysing forms of legal worldmaking, it unearths a nomos of global circulation which applies its regulatory force to the post-human materialities of microbial traffic.

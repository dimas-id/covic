A central tenet of reconstructive surgery is the principle of "replacing like with like." However, due to limitations in the availability of autologous tissue or because of the complications that may ensue from harvesting it, autologous reconstruction may be impractical to perform or too costly in terms of patient donor-site morbidity. The field of tissue engineering has long held promise to alleviate these shortcomings. Scaffolds are the structural building blocks of tissue-engineered constructs, akin to the extracellular matrix within native tissues. Commonly used scaffolds include allogenic or xenogenic decellularized tissue, synthetic or naturally derived hydrogels, and synthetic biodegradable nonhydrogel polymeric scaffolds. Embryonic, induced pluripotent, and mesenchymal stem cells also hold immense potential for regenerative purposes. Chemical signals including growth factors and cytokines may be harnessed to augment wound healing and tissue regeneration. Tissue engineering is already clinically prevalent in the fields of breast augmentation and reconstruction, skin substitutes, wound healing, auricular reconstruction, and bone, cartilage, and nerve grafting. Future directions for tissue engineering in plastic surgery include the development of prevascularized constructs and rationally designed scaffolds, the use of stem cells to regenerate organs and tissues, and gene therapy.

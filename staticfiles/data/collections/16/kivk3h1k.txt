An 84-year-old male patient with known ischemic cardiomy-opathy was admitted to the emergency department of Leip-zig University Hospital with typical signs and symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome in the midst of the SARS-Cov2 pandemic on April 22, 2020 His angina rapidly resolved after angioplasty of a sub-total proximal occlusion of his right coronary artery However, 12 h later his 81-year-old wife was brought to a secondary care hospital by the emergency doctor because of acute and severe shortness of breath and typical angina Elevated Troponin, ECG-and echocar-diographic abnormalities led to her urgent transfer to our hospital with the suspected diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction Her medical history included chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension Otherwise, the patient was previously well, mobile and in very good general condition Clinical examination showed an obese woman (163 cm, 97 kg, blood pressure 130/73 mmHg, heart rate 78/min, and body temperature 37 2 °C) The laboratory findings are presented in Table 1 The 12-lead-ECG at admission displayed a sinus rhythm with a previously known right bundle branch block and new negative T-waves in II, III, aVF and V3-6 (Fig 1) Echocardiography (Fig 2) showed wall motion abnormalities with apical septal dyskinesis, mid ubiquitous akinesia and basal septal and anterior hypokinesis Left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced to 45% Global longitudinal strain with a typical strain pattern of apical balloning was −8% (Fig 3) Coronary angiogram revealed no signs of artery disease (CAD), as shown in Fig 4 Cardiac MR (Fig 5) showed wall motion abnormalities corresponding to the echocardiography The tissue characterization by T2STIR sequences documented severe edema (Fig 6) T1TFE sequences showed diffuse late enhancement T1-and T2-mapping showed severely increased T1 and T2 values (1660 ms and 68 ms), respectively Extracellular volume was ~ 37% In summary, the findings fulfill the criteria of a Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy [1] Focused evaluation of potential emotional or physical triggers revealed that the patient suffered from psychologic stress during the last few weeks Due to media reports, she was highly afraid of SARS-CoV2 infections for her husband and herself, because age and hypertension were communicated as high risk for a severe course of COVID-19 Furthermore, she felt severely affected by the lockdown measures Her condition acutely and severely exacerbated when her husband was admitted to the hospital, which she felt would place him at a high risk of death, and because she was not allowed to visit him due to the SARS-CoV2-specific regulations The patient was provided with psychological support and the SARS-CoV2-negative couple was allowed to meet Heart failure therapy including an angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker, mineraloreceptor antagonist and a loop diuretic Table 1 Laboratory results on admission Reference range CK 1 79 µkat/l (0 43-2 34 µkat/l) CK-MB 0 47 µkat/l ( 90 ml/min/1 73m 2) Urea 12 6 mmol/l (&lt; 11 9 mmol/l) LDH 4 82 µkat/l (2 25-3 55 µkat/l)

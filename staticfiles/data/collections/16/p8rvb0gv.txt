Haemophilus parasuis is a common cause of polyserositis and polyarthritis in swine. Little is known about the mucosal and systemic sites of replication and lesions which follow an aerosol exposure to H. parasuis. In this experiment 5-week-old cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs were inoculated intranasally with an inoculum containing 2 x 10(9) colony-forming units of H. parasuis. Two principals and one control pig were necropsied at 12, 36, 84, and 108 hours postinoculation (PI) and samples obtained for bacteriologic culture and microscopic examination. Inoculated pigs developed clinical signs of inappetence, reluctance to move, lameness, and a serous nasal discharge. Macroscopic findings included a fibrinous polyserositis and polyarthritis 36 hours PI which became progressively more severe at 84 and 108 hours PI. No lung lesions were grossly visible. Microscopic lesions included a mild purulent rhinitis at each post inoculation interval and fibrinous to fibrinopurulent synovitis and serositis at 36, 84, and 108 hours PI. A focal suppurative bronchopneumonia was observed in one pig examined at 36 hours PI. The nasal cavity and trachea were the only mucosal sites from which H. parasuis was reisolated. Haemophilus parasuis was isolated from the blood and systemic sites at 36, 84, and 108 hours PI. Findings presented indicated that intranasal inoculation of 5-week-old CDCD pigs with H. parasuis results in clinical signs and lesions of polyserositis and polyarthritis typical of field cases and is a useful model for the study of H. parasuis pathogenesis. The results also suggest that H. parasuis initially colonizes the nasal mucosa.

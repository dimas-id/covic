BACKGROUND: Mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major concern for quarantine departments in all countries. This is because the mortality of infectious diseases determines the basic policy stance of measures to prevent infectious diseases. Early screening of high-risk groups and taking action are the basics of disease management. This study examined the correlation of comorbidities on the mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We constructed epidemiologic characteristics and medical history database based on the Korean National Health Insurance Service Big Data and linked COVID-19 registry data of Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) for this emergent observational cohort study. A total of 9,148 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Mortalities by sex, age, district, income level and all range of comorbidities classified by International Classification of Diseases-10 based 298 categories were estimated. RESULTS: There were 3,556 male confirmed cases, 67 deaths, and crude death rate (CDR) of 1.88%. There were 5,592 females, 63 deaths, and CDR of 1.13%. The most confirmed cases were 1,352 patients between the ages of 20 to 24, followed by 25 to 29. As a result of multivariate logistic regression analysis that adjusted epidemiologic factors to view the risk of death, the odds ratio of death would be hemorrhagic conditions and other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs 3.88-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-9.88), heart failure 3.17-fold (95% CI, 1.88-5.34), renal failure 3.07-fold (95% CI, 1.43-6.61), prostate malignant neoplasm 2.88-fold (95% CI, 1.01-8.22), acute myocardial infarction 2.38-fold (95% CI, 1.03-5.49), diabetes was 1.82-fold (95% CI, 1.25-2.67), and other ischemic heart disease 1.71-fold (95% CI, 1.09-2.66). CONCLUSION: We hope that this study could provide information on high risk groups for preemptive interventions. In the future, if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, it is expected that this study will be the basic data for recommending immunization by selecting those with chronic disease that had high risk of death, as recommended target diseases for vaccination.

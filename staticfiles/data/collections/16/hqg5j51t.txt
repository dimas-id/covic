The global health emergency of novel COVID-19 is due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently there are no approved drugs for the treatment of coronaviral disease (COVID-19), although some of the drugs have been tried. Chloroquine is being widely used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine, the derivative of Chloroquine shows better inhibition than Chloroquine and has in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 also used to treat COVID-19. To study the interactions of Chloroquine and derivatives of Chloroquine with SARS-CoV-2, series of computational approaches like pharmacophore model, molecular docking, MM_GBSA study and ADME property analysis are explored. The pharmacophore model and molecular docking study are used to explore the structural properties of the compounds and the ligand-receptor (PDB_ID: 6LU7) interactions respectively. MM_GBSA study gives the binding free energy of the protein-ligand complex and ADME property analysis explains the pharmacological property of the compounds. The resultant best molecule (CQD15) further subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study which explains the protein stability (RMSD), ligand properties as well as protein-ligand contacts. Outcomes of the present study conclude with the molecule CQD15 which shows better interactions for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

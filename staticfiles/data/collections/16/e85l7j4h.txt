BACKGROUND For pancreatic tumors located in the body or tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy (DP) remains the surgical procedure of choice to achieve radical tumor removal. Purpose of this study was to evaluate outcome and overall survival of patients who underwent DP combined with multivisceral resection (MVR). METHODS Retrospective single-center case-matched analysis. Between January 1994 and June 2014, 494 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective database, and 126 patients undergoing DP + MVR (cases) were matched with 126 patients undergoing DP (controls) for gender, age, and underlying final diagnosis. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics. Rates of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) (36 (28.6%) vs. 29 (23.0%); p = 0.388) and postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (7 (5.5%) vs. 5 (3.9%); p = 0.769) did not reveal any significant differences. Although operative time (237.8 ± 57.9 vs. 203.5 ± 34.5; p < 0.001) and the necessity for intraoperative transfusions (18 (14.3%) vs. 5 (4.0%); p < 0.001) was significantly higher, the number of patients with major complications (the Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3) was not increased (27 (19.8%) vs. 20 (15.9%); p = 0.332) in the DP + MVR group. Midterm survival analysis indicated no significant difference for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors for either group. CONCLUSION DP + MVR is a feasible and safe surgical procedure to achieve radical tumor removal and can offer beneficial survival outcomes. Although operative time and intraoperative transfusions are enhanced, POPF, PPH, or major complications (the Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3) are not significantly increased after DP + MVR. DP + MVR can therefore be recommended in selected patients for resection of extended tumors within the concept of interdisciplinary strategies.

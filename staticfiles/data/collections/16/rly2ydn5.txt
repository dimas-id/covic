Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, single-chain positive RNA viruses constituting a fairly large family. 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 species are common in humans, often causing mild to moderate respiratory infections. On the other hand, new coronaviruses have emerged, causing severe respiratory infection such as “severe acute respiratory syndrome” (SARS) in 2002 and “Middle East respiratory syndrome” (MERS) in 2012. The most recent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 disease was identified in 2019. While people of all ages are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, those with underlying chronic diseases and elderly age have increased susceptibility. There is no specific antiviral drug for COVID-19 infection. Therefore, treatment strategy is mostly aimed at supportive treatment and prevention of complications. The main protection measure is to avoid contact with the person infected with COVID-19. Following the identification of COVID-19 disease, it exceeded the region where it was located, the number of cases increased gradually, and intercontinental reports were made. COVID-19 is a highly pathogenic respiratory virus threatening global public health today. In order to eradicate the virus, it is necessary to clarify the source of the virus, to develop specific, effective treatments and a safe vaccine. Effective surveillance and appropriate infection control measures are critical to prevent the spread of the virus.

The complement system is a family of serum and cell surface proteins that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, altered-self ligands, and immune complexes. Activation of the complement cascade triggers several antiviral functions including pathogen opsonization and/or lysis, and priming of adaptive immune responses. In this review, we will examine the role of complement activation in protection and/or pathogenesis against infection by Flaviviruses, with an emphasis on experiments with West Nile and Dengue viruses.

Pelvic traumatic and iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms supplied by the internal iliac artery are very rare but can present with pain, nerve compression, and rupture. Particularly with more chronic pseudoaneurysms, their imaging appearance can be confusing and they can be mistaken for tumors. We present two cases of pelvic pseudoaneurysms supplied by the superior gluteal artery that were initially mistaken for masses and subsequently biopsied. We report the subsequent successful endovascular embolization technique subsequently utilized for both of these cases. A high index of suspicion should be maintained to avoid biopsy of these lesions. In the appropriately selected patient, an endovascular approach may be safely used to perform embolization.

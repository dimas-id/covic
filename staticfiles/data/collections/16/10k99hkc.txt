The miniaturization of real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using drop-based microfluidics, or droplet qPCR, allows for quantification of single nucleic acids. The nucleic acids are compartmentalized into aqueous microdroplets, picoliters in volume, separated by an immiscible oil, and stabilized by a surfactant. In droplet qPCR, accurate data can only be obtained if the drops remain stable to coalescence upon thermocycling and drop contents do not diffuse to neighboring drops. In this work, we present a droplet qRT-PCR assay for quantifying influenza A virus (IAV) following systematic testing of different PCR additives, resulting in the optimal combination of Tween-20 / BSA / betaine to maintain drop stability and limit dye diffusion. We use a standard qPCR machine to generate real time amplification curves of hundreds of thousands of drops and correlate this data with constructed amplification curves obtained from hundreds of drops sampled at various cycle numbers and imaged using epifluorescence microscopy. To demonstrate the utility of our method, we tested a range of in vitro transcribed M gene and IAV viral supernatant from infected cells. We directly amplified IAV genomes from infected supernatant without an RNA extraction step. Our droplet qPCR assay enables detection of IAV down to 0.274 cpd, or a single viral genome per drop, establishing the high sensitivity and precision of our method.

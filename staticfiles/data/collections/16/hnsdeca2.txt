We report on the resistive switching characteristics of HoCrO3 (HCO) based memristor device. The device Ag/HCO/FTO shows a stable bipolar resistive switching with a good ON/OFF resistance ratio between high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS). Indeed, the device is capable for excellent endurance and retentivity over the period of 30 days. The statistical distribution of switching parameters (voltage and resistance) show a narrow distribution, hinting that a trustful memory performance and stability of the device. Impedance spectroscopy analysis of HRS and LRS illustrates bulk resistance effect which is due to formation of multiple ionic conductive channels in the film with oxygen vacancies. Indeed, conducting channels formed by oxygen vacancies further confirmed by calculating temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) through resistance vs. temperature measurements. We believe that these results will be helpful in developing future memory devices based on resistive switching.

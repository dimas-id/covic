OBJECTIVES Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pulmonary segmentectomy is commonly used in treating small ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules in lung. The identification of the intersegmental plane is one of the challenges. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG) angiography in VATS segmentectomy. METHODS Nineteen GGO patients were enrolled, and VATS segmentectomy with ICG near-infrared angiography were performed between July 2017 and December 2017. Conventional 3-port VATS was used. ICG was injected intravenously after dominant arties were ligated. Intersegmental plane was identified and divided by stapler and electrocautery. RESULTS All patients had perfect intersegmental plane visualization. The mean operation time was 140.8 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 23.7 mL. No complications due to ICG occurred. The mean chest tube duration was 4.6 days. No severe complications occurred in the perioperative period. The mean chest tube drainage duration was 4.6 days. Prolonged postoperative air leak (>5 days), which required no surgical intervention, occurred in 2 cases. There were no severe complications or in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS VATS segmentectomy with ICG near-infrared angiography is a reasonable treatment option to treat small GGO in lung, especially due to its good surgical view maintenance.

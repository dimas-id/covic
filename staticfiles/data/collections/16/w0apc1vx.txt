This is a Standards of Practice document endorsed by CIRSE. The authors performed a literature review and provide recommendations and quality improvement guidelines based on the most recent and highest level of evidence available to date on the field of Superficial Femoral and Popliteal Artery Angioplasty and Stenting. Standards for the use of basic and more advanced endovascular techniques in the femoropopliteal arteries are reported and relevant aspects of case selection, imaging, follow-up, and overall patient management are presented to guide endovascular practice in Europe.

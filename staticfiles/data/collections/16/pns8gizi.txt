Objective: To investigate the multi compound-target-pathway mechanism of Renshen Baidu Powder (RSBDS) in the treatment of COVID-19 from cytokine perspective. Methods: The active compounds of RSBDS were collected by TCMSP and the cytokine storm related targets were collected by the drug target database. The interaction network of RSBDS on single drug-active compounds-targets was established by Cytoscape. The interaction network, GO function and KEGG pathway of the targets were analyzed by String and DAVID databases. Results: The interaction network of RSBDS on single drug-active compounds-targets included 10 kinds of medicinal materials, 211 active compounds and 151 disease targets. Interaction network showed that the targets related to the inhibition to cytokine storm of RSBDS on COVID-19 might include STAT3, MAPK1, NFκB1, PIK3CA, MAPK3, TNF, CXCR4, VEGFA, IL-6, IL-2, etc. GO function showed that above targets in biological function involved chemotaxis and steroid metabolism; Molecular function entries involved heme binding, iron ion binding and oxygen binding; Cell composition entries involved cell surface and cell membrane. KEGG pathway showed that above targets participated in the regulation of Chagas disease, HIF-1 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, etc. Conclusion: The multi compound-target-pathways effect of RSBDS on COVID-19 was realized by inhibiting cytokine storm, which through regulating chemotaxis, increasing blood oxygen saturation, inhibiting STAT, MAPK, NFκB, PIK3K and IL-6 signal pathways.

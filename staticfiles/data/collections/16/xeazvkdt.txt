In the view of off-label use, special concern should be granted to obtaining informed consent from the patient. It is important to point out the test character of the treatment. The patient has to be informed about the risks that exist with the treatment. The patient has to know that a drug not yet approved for this treatment is being used and the risks linked with its use have to be addressed. In addition, informed consent has to be documented and the differences compared with the standard treatment have to be pointed out.

The aim of the present survey was to evaluate the prevalence of Canine rotavirus (CRV) infection in companion dogs in Ahvaz district, Iran. The studied dogs were selected between referred cases to Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz. Fecal samples were collected from 98 diarrheic dogs between December 2011 and August 2013. The dogs were classified according to age, sex, breed, clinical signs, and season. They were divided into three age groups (<3 months, 3–6 months, and >6 months), five different breeds, and another two groups on the basis of clinical symptoms (hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic diarrhea) using Chi-square analysis, Fischer’s exact test, and Z test. The prevalence of rotavirus infection was 16.33 % (16 out of 98) (95 % CI for proportion 9.1–23.6 %) by means of immunochromatography assay (ICA) (Catalog No. RG18-03). The infection had significantly more prevalence in dogs less than 3 months (48.15 %; 13 out of 27) compared with dogs between 3 and 6 months (6.06 %; 2 out of 33) and above 6 months (2.63 %; 1 out of 38) (p < 0.05). Prevalence was higher in males (17.54 %; 10 out of 57) than females (14.63 %; 6 out of 41), in winter season (21.74 %; 5 out of 23), and breed of German shepherd (19.05 %; 4 of 21), but the difference was not significant between the prevalence of infection relative to gender, season, and breed (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, infection was significantly higher in none-hemorrhagic diarrheic dogs (23.08 %; 15 of 65) (p < 0.05). The obtained results provide useful information on the epidemiology of Canine rotavirus in this area.

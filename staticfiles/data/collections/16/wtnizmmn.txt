With regard to laparoscopic and robotic abdominoperineal resection (APR) for primary rectal malignancies, limited data have been published in the literature. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SLS) has been successfully introduced for treating colorectal cancer. Here we describe our experience of APR with SLS plus one port (SLS + 1) for treating advanced rectal cancer. A 65-year-old man underwent the procedure, which involved a 35-mm incision in the left side of the umbilicus for the insertion of a single multichannel port as well as the insertion of a 5-mm port into the right lower quadrant. The sigmoid colon and rectum were mobilized from the pelvic floor using a medial and lateral approach. After the rectum with the mesorectum was completely mobilized according to the total mesorectal excision, the sigmoid colon was intracorporeally transected. The specimen was removed through the perineal wound. Terminal colostomy was fashioned at the left lower trocar site. Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection was bilaterally performed. There were no perioperative complications. The total operating time was 592 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 180 mL. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SLS + 1 APR with lateral pelvic lymph node dissection for treating rectal cancer. We conclude that SLS + 1 APR is a technically promising alternative method for treating selected patients with advanced rectal cancer.

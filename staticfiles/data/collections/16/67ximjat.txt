Here we present a toolbox for natural language processing tasks related to SARS-CoV-2. It comprises English dictionaries of synonyms for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, a silver standard corpus generated with the dictionaries and a gold standard corpus of 10 Pubmed abstracts manually annotated for disease, virus, symptom and protein/gene terms. This toolbox is freely available on github (on https://github.com/Aitslab/corona) and can be used for text analytics in a variety of settings related to the COVID-19 crisis. It will be expanded and applied in NLP tasks over the next weeks and the community is invited to contribute.

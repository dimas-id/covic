MERS-CoV infection is an emerging infectious disease with a high mortality rate. The exact incidence and prevalence of the disease is not known as we do not have yet reliable serologic tests. The diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection relies on detection of the virus using real-time RT-PCR. Currently, the origin of the virus and the source is not known and future studies are needed to elucidate possible sources and the best therapeutic options.

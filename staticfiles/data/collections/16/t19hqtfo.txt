The molecular basis of constitutive and inducible major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene expression was studied in murine astrocytes in primary culture. Astrocytes constitutively expressed MHC class I molecules and treatment of these cells with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) further induced expression. The conserved region containing the upstream MHC class I regulatory element (MHC-CRE) and juxtaposed interferon consensus sequence (ICS) enhanced consttutive MHC class I promoter activity. As seen with cell surface expression of MHC molecules, treatment of astrocytes with IFN-γ increased MHC class I promoter activity. Inducible expression required the presence of the MHC-CRE/ICS enhancer region. Nuclear factors that bind to the MHC-CRE and ICS were constitutively expressed in cultured astrocytes and IFN-γ treatment further induced binding activity both to the MHC-CRE and ICS and correlated with induction of MHC class I gene expression. This study identifies the MHC-CRE and ICS as the major cis elements in controlling MHC class I promoter activity and suggests that the expression of nuclear factor binding activities to these enhancer elements is a basic transactivating mechanism for the expression of MHC class I genes in astrocytes.

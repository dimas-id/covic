We present a mobile app solution to help the containment of an epidemic outbreak by keeping track of possible infections in the incubation period. We consider the particular case of an infection which primarily spreads among people through proximal contact, via respiratory droplets. This smartphone application will work offline and will be able to detect other devices in close proximity and list all the interactions in an anonymous and encrypted way. If an app user is tested positive and so is certified as infected, the application notifies immediately the potential contagion to the devices in the list and suggests to start a voluntary quarantine and undergo a medical test. We believe this solution may be useful in particular in the current COVID-19 pandemic and moreover could be used to prevent similar events in the future.

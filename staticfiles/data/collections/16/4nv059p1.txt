COVID-19 is the pandemic outbreak that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus from December, 2019. Human race do not know the curative measure of this devastating disease. In todayâ€™s era of nanotechnology, it may use its knowledge to develop molecular vaccine to combat this disease. In this article we are intended to propose a hypothesis on the development of a vaccine that is molecular in nature to work against COVID-19. The nanoconjugate may comprise with the inorganic nanoparticle layered double hydroxide intercalated with shRNA-plasmid that have a sequence targeting towards the viral genome or viral mRNA. This nanoconjugate may be used as a nasal spray to deliver the shRNA-plasmid to the target site. The nanoconjugate will have several advantages such as they are biocompatible, they forms as stable knockdown to the target cells and they are stable in the nasal mucosa.

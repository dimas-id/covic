Conditions affecting the brachial plexus and its branches can cause lameness and/or neurological deficits. There are few reports of schwannomas in cats. In reported cases, the tumours arose from the dermis or subcutis of the limbs, head and neck and thorax, but there are no reports of primary tumours that arose from the brachial plexus itself. The purpose of this study is to present the clinical, radiological, ultrasonographical and pathological findings of primary brachial plexus tumour in three cats.

In recent years, several research articles have been published in the field of corona-virus caused diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19. In the presence of numerous research articles, extracting best-suited articles is time-consuming and manually impractical. The objective of this paper is to extract the activity and trends of corona-virus related research articles using machine learning approaches. The COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) is used for experiments, whereas several target-tasks along with explanations are defined for classification, based on domain knowledge. Clustering techniques are used to create the different clusters of available articles, and later the task assignment is performed using parallel one-class support vector machines (OCSVMs). Experiments with original and reduced features validate the performance of the approach. It is evident that the k-means clustering algorithm, followed by parallel OCSVMs, outperforms other methods for both original and reduced feature space.

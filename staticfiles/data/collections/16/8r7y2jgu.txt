OBJECTIVE Focal endoscopic resection (ER) followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) safely and effectively eradicates Barrett's oesophagus (BO) containing high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and/or early cancer (EC) in smaller studies with limited follow-up. Herein, we report long-term outcomes of combined ER and RFA for BO (HGD and/or EC) from a single-arm multicentre interventional study. DESIGN In 13 European centres, patients with BO â‰¤ 12 cm with HGD and/or EC on 2 separate endoscopies were eligible for inclusion. Visible lesions (<2 cm length; <50% circumference) were removed with ER, followed by serial RFA every 3 months (max 5 sessions). Follow-up endoscopy was scheduled at 6 months after the first negative post-treatment endoscopic control and annually thereafter. OUTCOMES complete eradication of neoplasia (CE-neo) and intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM); durability of CE-neo and CE-IM (once achieved) during follow-up. Biopsy and resection specimens underwent centralised pathology review. RESULTS 132 patients with median BO length C3M6 were included. After entry-ER in 119 patients (90%) and a median of 3 RFA (IQR 3-4) treatments, CE-neo was achieved in 121/132 (92%) and CE-IM in 115/132 patients (87%), per intention-to-treat analysis. Per-protocol analysis, CE-neo and CE-IM were achieved in 98% and 93%, respectively. After a median of 27 months following the first negative post-treatment endoscopic control, neoplasia and IM recurred in 4% and 8%, respectively. Mild-to-moderate adverse events occurred in 25 patients (19%); all managed conservatively or endoscopically. CONCLUSIONS In patients with early Barrett's neoplasia, intensive multimodality endotherapy consisting of ER combined with RFA is safe and highly effective, and the treatment effect appears to be durable during mid-term follow-up.

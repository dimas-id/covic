In this paper, the identification of context-free grammars based on the presentation of samples is investigated. The main idea of solving this problem proposed in the literature is reformulated in two different ways: in terms of general constrains and as an answer set program. In a series of experiments, we showed that our answer set programming approach is much faster than our alternative method and the original SAT encoding method. Similarly to a pioneer work, some well-known context-free grammars have been induced correctly, and we also followed its test procedure with randomly generated grammars, making it clear that using our answer set programs increases computational efficiency. The research can be regarded as another evidence that solutions based on the stable model (answer set) semantics of logic programming may be a right choice for complex problems.

Abstract The High-speed Railway (HSR) network in China is the largest in the world, competing intensively with airlines for inter-city travel. Panel data from 2007 to 2013 for 138 routes with HSR-air competition were used to identify the ex-post impacts of the entry of HSR services, the duration of operating HSR services since entry, and the specific impacts of HSR transportation variables such as travel time, frequency, and ticket fares on air passenger flows in China. The findings show that the entry of new HSR services in general leads to a 27% reduction in air travel demand. After two years of operating HSR services, however, the negative impact of HSR services on air passenger flows tends to further increase. The variations of the frequency in the temporal dimension and the travel time in the spatial dimension significantly affect air passenger flows. Neither in the temporal nor spatial dimensions are HSR fares strongly related to air passenger flows in China, due to the government regulation of HSR ticket prices during the period of analysis. The impacts of different transportation variables found in this paper are valuable to consider by operational HSR companies in terms of scheduling and planning of new routes to increase their competitiveness relative to airlines.

OBJECTIVES To assess whether atherosclerosis is involved in the development of overactive bladder and the function of lower urinary tract after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. METHODS The present cohort consisted of 80 consecutive participants. The preoperative cardio-ankle vascular index was used to evaluate the presence of atherosclerosis. The present cohort was split into two groups, the atherosclerotic group, whose cardio-ankle vascular index was â‰¥9.0, and the control group, whose index was <9.0. The overactive bladder symptom score and lower urinary tract function were compared for 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The total score of the questionnaire was significantly higher at 6 and 9 months after surgery in the atherosclerosis group (P = 0.04, P = 0.03, respectively). Both the urgency and urgency incontinence subscores of the questionnaire showed a parallel tendency to that of the total score after surgery. At 3 months after surgery, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of de novo overactive bladder in the atherosclerosis group (P = 0.04). At 9 and 12 months after surgery, there was a significant decrease of voided volume in the atherosclerotic group (P < 0.01, P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Atherosclerosis delays the improvement in both overactive bladder symptoms and storage function postoperatively, and it is involved in the transient increase in the prevalence of de novo overactive bladder. Atherosclerosis might be a predictor of the development of overactive bladder after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

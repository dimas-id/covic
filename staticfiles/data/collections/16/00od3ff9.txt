Earthquakes are events that cannot be predicted. However, when they occur, devastating consequences are shown in economic, social and structural areas, among others. In this paper, the mining of association rules is carried out in order to estimate the repair cost required by schools affected during the earthquakes of September 7th and 19th, of 2017 in Mexico. For that, we use the public data collected by the Mexican FONDEN.

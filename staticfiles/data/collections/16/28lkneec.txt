In 2003, the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused worldwide chaos. Although SARS was eradicated by isolation towards the end of 2003, sporadic cases have been reported in Singapore, Taiwan and mainland China. In this review, SARS is discussed as a disease, as well as its diagnosis, management and pharmacotherapy.

More research is required in order to prepare for if this respiratory infection recurs, but there are concerns that adequate pharmaceutical support may be lacking for the development of a vaccine.

Abstract Immunization during pregnancy is an efficient strategy to protect both the mother and the newborn infant against infectious pathogens. Pregnant women have an increased susceptibility to severe infections caused by some pathogens, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Pregnancy is associated with dynamic changes in maternal immune system that are critical for tolerance of the fetus. These changes could also play an important role in shaping maternal immune components that are transferred to the newborn infant following natural infection or vaccination to prevent infectious diseases in early life. As the momentum for maternal immunization is growing, there is a need to increase our understanding of the immunobiology of maternal immunization in order to better prevent infectious diseases in the pregnant women and the young infant.

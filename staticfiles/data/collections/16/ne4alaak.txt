The biological function of bovine colostral immunoglobulins is to provide the newborn calf with adequate passive immune protection against microbial infections. Immunoglobulin preparations designed for farm animals are commercially available, and some colostrum-based products are marketed also for humans as dietary supplements. The concentration of specific antibodies against a certain pathogenic microorganism can be raised in colostrum and milk by immunizing cows with this pathogen or its antigen. Advances in bioseparation and chromatographic techniques have made it possible to fractionate and enrich these antibodies and formulate so-called hyperimmune colostral or milk preparations. Their efficacy in prevention and treatment of various microbial infections has been evaluated in numerous studies. Immune milk preparations have proven effective in prophylaxis against infections caused by a variety of gastrointestinal pathogens. Their therapeutic efficacy, however, seems more limited. A few commercial immune milk products are already on market and more applications can be expected in the coming years. This article reviews the recent progress made in isolation techniques of bovine immunoglobulins and the application of colostral and immune milk preparations in fighting various microbial infectious diseases in humans.

BACKGROUND: Interferon‐α2 (IFNα2) is routinely used for anti‐hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment. However, the therapeutic efficiency is unsatisfactory, particularly in East Asia. Such inefficiency might be a result of the short half‐life, relatively low local concentration and strong side‐effects of interferons. Frequent and repeated injection is also a big burden for patients. In the present study, a single dose of vector‐delivered IFNα1 was tested for its anti‐HBV effects. METHODS: Adeno‐associated viral vector (AAV‐IFNα1) was generated to deliver the IFNα1 gene into hepatocytes. IFNα1, hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and/or western blotting. The level of viral DNA was measured by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: AAV‐IFNα1 effectively transduced HBV‐producing cells (HepAD38) and mouse hepatocytes, where IFNα1 was expressed in a stable manner. Both intracellular and extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly reduced in vitro. In the HBV‐producing mice, the concentration of IFNα1 in the liver was eight‐fold higher than that in plasma. Compared with control groups, HBeAg/HBsAg antigen levels were reduced by more than ten‐fold from day 1–5, and dropped to an undetectable level on day 9 in the AAV‐IFNα1 group. Concurrently, the level of viral DNA decreased over 30‐fold for several weeks. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose administration of AAV‐IFNα1 viral vector displayed prolonged transgene expression and superior antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the use of AAV‐IFNα1 might be a potential alternative strategy for anti‐HBV therapy. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

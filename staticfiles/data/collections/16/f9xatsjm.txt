We describe a pursestring stapled anastomotic technique for minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, in which a pursestring is hand sewn through the muscular layer of the intact esophagus by using one piece of 3-0 Prolene suture. The anvil of a circular stapler is inserted through an esophageal incision, 2 to 3 cm distal to the pursestring, and secured by the pursestring. The esophagus is transected, and the mucosa of the proximal stump is retained 5 mm longer than the adjacent muscular layer. The gastroesophageal anastomosis is completed and embedded by using the previously reserved 2 cm of mediastinal pleura.

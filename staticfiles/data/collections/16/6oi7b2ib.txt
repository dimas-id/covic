Objective: To discuss the high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients among different clinical types on initial and follow-up CT. Methods: Seven COVID-19 patients admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical Collage were enrolled. All patients underwent initial and follow-up chest HRCT. The main CT features and semi-quantitative score which represent disease severity among different clinical types were evaluated. Result: On initial CT, the main abnormalities observed in common and severe cases respectively were pure ground glass opacities (GGOs) and patchy consolidation surrounded by GGOs. Critical cases had multiple consolidation surrounded by wide range of GGOs distributed in the whole lung fields. The scope and density score in common (4.5 and 5), severe (9.5 and 9.5) and critical (19 and 12) cases were increased by gradient. On follow-up CT, common and severe types manifested as decreasing density of lesion, absorbed consolidation and GGOs. Critical cases showed progression of the disease. The extent and progression scores in common and severe patients were significantly decreased, while the range score of patients with critical disease reached the highest points, accompanied with an increase in the density score. Conclusion: CT scanning can accurately assess the severity of COVID-19, and help to monitor disease transformation during follow-up among different clinical conditions.

Abstract Objective The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients presenting with only sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) during the pandemic. Methods The study included 5 male patients who presented with the sole complaint of unilateral SSNHL to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic between April 3 and April 12, 2020. The patients were referred to the infectious diseases clinic to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Results RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in one of the patient and negative in rest four patients. We also noted positive response to Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) specific treatment in SARS-CoV-2 positive SSNHL patient. Conclusion It should be kept in mind that non-specific symptoms such as SSNHL could be the only sign to recognize a COVID-19 case. Awareness of such a non-specific presentation of COVID-19 patients is crucial during this pandemic period for the prevention of infectious spread through isolation and early initiation of COVID-19 targeted treatment.

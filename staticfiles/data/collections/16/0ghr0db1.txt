It has been observed by conducting an extensive analysis of the two-dimensional cellular automata images of known SARS-CoV genome sequences that the V-shaped cross-lines only exist in some special locations, and hence can be used as a fingerprint to identify the SARS sequences. Such a discovery can be used to rapidly and reliably diagnose SARS coronavirus for both basic research in laboratories and practical application in clinics.

Sleeve lobectomy for selected cases of central lung cancer has better functional outcomes comparing to pneumonectomy. With improved technology and increased experiences in complete video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, complete VATS sleeve lobectomy has been applied in major medical centers recently. A 64-year-old male patient with left lower central lung cancer underwent thoracoscopic sleeve lobectomy and systemic mediastinal lymph node dissection. The major incision, of four incisions in total, was a 4 cm mini-incision in the 4th intercostal space of anterior axillary line. The patient had recovered uneventfully after the surgery.

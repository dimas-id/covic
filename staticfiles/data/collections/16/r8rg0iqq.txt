Millions of children travel annually, whether they are refugees, international adoptees, visitors, or vacationers. Although most young travelers do well, many develop a febrile illness during or shortly after their trips. Approaching a fever in the returning traveler requires an appropriate index of suspicion to diagnose and treat in a timely manner. As many as 34% of patients with recent travel history are diagnosed with routine infections, but serious infections such as malaria, enteric fever, and dengue fever should be on the differential diagnosis due the high morbidity and mortality in children.

A compact model of imaging ellipsometer is used for the data acquisition and analysis of label free protein microarray. Its principle, methodology, and experimental setup as well as sampling conditions and a demonstration result are presented here. Furthermore, results of protein adsorption and protein interaction in the microarray may be deduced. This shows that the compact model is effectively performed as a reader for the protein microarray sampling and provides a potential for applications of label free protein microarrays on site of care.

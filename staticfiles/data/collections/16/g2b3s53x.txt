Abstract Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate differences in the frequency and types of engagement in sport before, during, and after the COVID-19 stay-at-home order in Tyrol, Austria. Study design A representative population survey was conducted. Methods A sample of Tyroleans (N = 511) were questioned by a market research institute via online questionnaire or telephone survey. Results During the stay-at-home order survey participants did less sport than before and after the restrictions. However, within-group analyses revealed increasing sport participation in less active groups when comparing the pre- and post-COVID-19 period. Conclusions Despite the restrictions during the stay-at-home order, respondents did sport and promoted their health. Nevertheless, it is still necessary to investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 crisis on sport and exercise behaviour as well as the extent to which sport policy measures may be able increase sport participation.

In this study, we evaluate the usefulness of preoperative endoscopic clipping for early gastric cancer (EGC) localization in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.We retrospectively screened all consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for EGC by 1 surgeon at Chungnam National University Hospital between January 2014 and December 2016. Patients who underwent combined surgery and patients who had tumors at the lower third of the stomach were excluded. Endoscopic clipping was performed prior to surgery by specialized endoscopists. During the operation, endoscopic metal clips were found using surgical devices, and laparoscopic vessel clips were attached on the presumed site; thereafter, intraoperative radiographs were obtained for confirmation.We analyzed a total of 196 patients; of them, 101 were classified into the clipping group (CG) and 95 into the non clipping group (NCG). The 2 groups were comparable regarding their demographic characteristics. The CG showed less additional resection (2 of 101 patients [2.0%] vs 9 of 95 patients [9.4%], P = .021) and better outcomes in terms of the operation time (P = .000), duration of hospital stay (P = .036), and postoperative atelectasis (P = .001) than the NCG.Preoperative endoscopic clipping was helpful in determining the exact resection margin in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for EGC.

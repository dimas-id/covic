The word “emergency” is defined by time. We work in time dependent windows of diagnosis and treatment. Consider the enormous impact of biomarkers and imaging now standard in the ED (troponin, d‐dimer, and lactic acid; and lightning fast pan‐scanning CT and bedside ultrasound). Faster detection of critical illness has also led to more ED administration of pharmacologic interventions (aspirin, thrombolytics, antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, pressors, TXA, 4 factor‐PCC, etc.). Helicopter transport, intra‐osseous vascular access, and pelvic binders all improve time dependent patient care.

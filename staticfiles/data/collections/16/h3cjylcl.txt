Acute bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) during the first year of life. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most prevalent virus found in these children, accounting for 60â€“80 % of cases. The rate of hospitalization is less than 2 %. Up to 8 % of those hospitalized require ventilatory support [1, 2].

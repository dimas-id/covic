To estimate strength of a scopolamine transdermal delivery system (TDS) in vivo, using residual drug vs. pharmacokinetic analyses with the goal of scientifically supporting a single and robust method for use across the dosage form and ultimately facilitate the development of more consistent and clinically meaningful labeling. A two-arm, open-label, crossover pharmacokinetic study was completed in 26 volunteers. Serum samples were collected and residual scopolamine was extracted from worn TDS. Delivery extent and rate were estimated by (1) numeric deconvolution and (2) steady-state serum concentration determined from graphical and non-compartmental analyses. In residual drug analyses, mean ± SD scopolamine release rate was 0.015 ± 0.002 mg/h (11% RSD), vs. 0.016 ± 0.006 mg/h (35% RSD) from numeric deconvolution, 0.015 ± 0.005 mg/h (34% RSD) from graphical analysis, and 0.015 ± 0.007 mg/h (44% RSD) from non-compartmental analysis. In residual drug analyses, total drug released was 1.09 ± 0.11 mg (10% RSD), vs. 1.12 ± 0.40 mg (35% RSD) from numeric deconvolution, 1.07 ± 0.35 mg (33% RSD) from graphical analysis, and 1.07 ± 0.45 (42% RSD) from non-compartmental analysis. Extent and rate of scopolamine release were comparable by both approaches, but pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated greater inter-subject variability.

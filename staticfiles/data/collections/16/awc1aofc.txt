Chikungunya is one of the highly infectious viral disease without vaccine and anti-viral. Aim of present study is to check the anti-chikungunya activities of Zingiber officinale (Ginger) in the animal cell culture model. The medicinal plant extract was prepared from Z. officinale rhizome. Median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD) of Z. officinale extract was determined in Vero cell-line on the basis of cell viability followed by MTT assay. In vitro anti-chikungunya activity was performed in Vero cell-line with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale medicinal plant extract. The anti-viral effect of Z. officinale was studied by observing the cytopathic effects and cell viability measured by MTT assay. Maximum non-toxic dose of Z. officinale plant extract was found 62.5 Î¼g/ml. During anti-chikungunya experimentation, cell viability increased to 51.05% and 35.10%, when Vero cells were pre-treated with MNTD and half of MNTD of Z. officinale extract respectively. Similarly, in co-treatment, when MNTD, half of MNTD of Z. officinale and Median tissue culture infective dose CHIKV were inoculated simultaneously, then the viability of Vero cell-line was increases by 52.90% and 49.02% respectively. The rhizome extracts of Z. officinale have high potential to treat CHIKV. Medicinal plants and their metabolites are most important sources of antimicrobial and can be utilized for the development of new drugs. In view of the rapid expansion of CHIKV at the global level, there is an urgent need to develop newer anti-chikungunya drugs.

As our understanding of infectious agents increases it has become possible to identify the biological components of individual strains with greater accuracy. This ability is aiding clinical microbiologists to control both existing and emerging infectious disease problems. Microarray technologies are playing an increasingly important role in supplying relevant test data. Control of the nanoscale structures of the materials used in arrays, including the supports, reagents and analytes, is now essential. New techniques for the manufacture of nanostructured supports is now allowing rapid advances in the fields of multianalyte testing and high-volume DNA sequencing.

We read with interest your recent article by Fogarty et al, in particular their conclusion that differences in thrombotic risk may contribute to ethnic disparities in mortality from Covid-19.(1) This is especially important in the UK, where age-sex adjusted hospital death rates for Covid-19 are 2.17 times higher for people with ethnicity recorded as black compared to those recorded as white, and 1.95 higher for those recorded as Asian.(2) This excess mortality persists after adjustment for deprivation, body mass index (BMI), smoking and comorbidities,(2) and despite correction for region, rural or urban living, deprivation, household composition, socioeconomic status, and health.(3) Similar data from the USA shows that in 14 states, African-Americans represent 33% of hospitalisations for Covid-19, despite only making up 14% of the catchment population.(4) Black ethnicity is a construct incorporating diverse populations of African descent. Studies from several communities labelled as black, in particular African-Americans, imply a common increase in thrombotic risk, which may contribute to unexplained ethnic disparities in the UK and USA in Covid-19.

PURPOSE The optimal strategy for the treatment of M1 segment aneurysms has not yet been determined as both standard microneurosurgical and endovascular techniques can pose challenges. We sought to determine the efficacy of flow diverting stents to treat small, unruptured aneurysms of the M1 segment. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our database of prospectively collected information for all patients treated with flow diversion for an unruptured saccular aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) between February 2009 and February 2016. The relationship to early cortical branches, aneurysm fundus size, number and type of flow diverting stent (FDS), complications and follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS In total 15 patients were identified that matched our inclusion criteria (11 female and 4 male). The average age of the patients was 58.3 years (range 14-76 years). All patients had a single aneurysm affecting the M1 segment of the MCA, 10 (66.6%) of which were related to early cortical branches and 10 aneurysms were located on the left (66.6%). The average aneurysm fundus size was 3 mm (range 2-9 mm) and 13 patients had follow-up angiographic studies. In total, 8 aneurysms were completely excluded, and 6 remained incompletely occluded (3 modified Raymond-Roy classification [mRRC] II and 3 mRRC IIIa). One patient suffered a stroke and another patient had an iatrogenic vessel dissection that was not flow limiting. CONCLUSION Flow diversion can be used to treat small, unruptured aneurysms of the M1 segment of the MCA and even though side vessel occlusion can occur clinically relevant infarction occurs infrequently.

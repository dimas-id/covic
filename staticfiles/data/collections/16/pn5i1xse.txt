The nervous and immune systems are two complex physiologic systems that are functionally shaped by the integration of both genetic factors and experience. Although these systems are usually studied in isolation from each other, these two systems are highly interactive and cross-regulate the functions of each system. Therefore, disruptions in these normal neuroimmune interactions likely contribute to a broad array of neurologic and neurodegenerative disorders.

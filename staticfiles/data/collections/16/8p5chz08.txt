Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections experience lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storms in the severe stage of the disease, leading to multi-organ damage. The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. Under the fact that inflammatory mediators are active in individuals with COVID-19, blocking the predominant pathway could be helpful.

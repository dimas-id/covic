Cancer immunotherapy including vaccine therapy is a promising modality for cancer treatment, but few patients show its clinical benefits currently. The identification of biomarkers that can identify patients who will benefit from cancer immunotherapy is thus important. Here, we investigated the potential utility of the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) integrity—a ratio of necrotic cell-derived, longer DNA fragments versus apoptotic cell-derived shorter fragments of Alu gene—as a biomarker of vaccine therapy for patients with ovarian cancer. We analyzed plasma samples from 39 patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in clinical trials for personalized peptide vaccinations. We observed that (1) the cfDNA integrity was decreased after the first cycle of vaccination, and (2) the decreased levels of cfDNA integrity were correlated with vaccine-induced immune responses; i.e., decreased cfDNA integrity was observed in 91.7% and 59.3% of the IgG-positive and negative patients, respectively (p = 0.0445). Similarly, decreased cfDNA integrity was observed in 92.9% and 56.0% of CTL response-positive and negative patients, respectively (p = 0.0283). These results suggest that the circulating cfDNA integrity is a possible biomarker for cancer vaccine therapy.

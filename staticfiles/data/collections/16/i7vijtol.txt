AIMS Providing a ready-to-use RT-qPCR method fully validated to detect the SARS-CoV-2 with a higher exclusivity than this shown by early published RT-qPCR designs. METHODS AND RESULTS The specificity of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test by analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT-qPCR designs. The GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test was validated following criteria of UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, (Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received the label CE-IVD. The GPS™ design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100 % correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and showed 100 % of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS The CE-IVD GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR Test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS-CoV-2 by far. SIGNIFICANCE Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses. IMPACT OF STUDY This work provides of a highly specific and validated RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared.

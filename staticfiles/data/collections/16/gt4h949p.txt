Airport Emergency Planning, Part II provides an overview of the core functions within airport emergency management, which include command, control, and communications (C3) and law enforcement, firefighting, public notification, emergency medical response, and resource management. Many airport emergencies require public notifications and, in some cases, Protective Actions, such as evacuation and shelter-in-place. Police, fire, and other Emergency Medical Services (EMS) comprise the core first responders to nearly any emergency, and these personnel have numerous responsibilities throughout the Airport Emergency Plan (AEP). The National Incident Management System, created after 9/11, is the standard method of managing disasters, incidents, and other events in the United States. It is based on three principles: Incident Command System (ICS), Multi-Agency Coordination, and Public Information. The five functions of ICS are command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration. For some incidents, an intelligence/investigative function is added.

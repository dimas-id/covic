BACKGROUND Concern regarding functioning and effectiveness of joint health and safety committees (JHSCs) in Ontario hospitals was raised following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003. A subsequent literature review revealed a lack of studies focused within the healthcare sector. METHODS A tool to measure JHSC effectiveness was developed by a panel of occupational health and safety experts based on a framework from the healthcare sector. Usability testing was conducted in two phases with members of five hospital JHSCs before, during and after a committee meeting. RESULTS Usability of the tool was scored high overall with an average of > 4 on a 5 point scale across twelve items. Downward adjustment of self-assessment scores was reported following JHSC meetings. CONCLUSION Findings demonstrated that the tool was easy to use, effective in supporting discussion and in assisting participants in reaching consensus on rating a large number of JHSC characteristics.

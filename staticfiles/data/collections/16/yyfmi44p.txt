The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity. In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy. Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination. A new framework of person-centered care could be a great ally to achieve integrated care for the elderly, guided by an increase in resources bound to funding longevity research projects.

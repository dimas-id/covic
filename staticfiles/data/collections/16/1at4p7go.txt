To determine the effect of various PEEP levels on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measured differences in regional ventilation, hemodynamics, lung mechanics and parameters of alveolar gas exchange. Thirty three patients scheduled for elective urologic surgery in general anesthesia in lateral decubitus position were randomized into three groups—PEEP 0, 5 and 10 mbar. EIT recording, arterial blood gas analysis and hemodynamic parameters were captured at three timepoints—before induction (T0), 5 min after lateral positioning (T1) and 90 min after positioning (T2). Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was measured at T1 and T2. Offline EIT data analysis was performed to calculate EIT derived parameters of ventilation distribution. Patients ventilated with PEEP of 10 mbar had a significantly lower A-a (alveolo arterial) gradient over measurements and symmetrical distribution of ventilation measured by EIT. There was no significant difference in Cdyn, center of ventilation indices and inhomogeneity index between groups. There was no difference of mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and heart rate between groups. Patients with 5 mbar of PEEP had higher stroke volume index compared to 0 and 10 mbar at baseline and over measurements. Nondependent/dependent TV ratio as well as global inhomogeneity index were correlated with A-a gradient. Dynamic compliance showed no correlation to A-a gradient. In our study, a PEEP level of 10 mbar improved alveolar gas exchange without compromising hemodynamic stability in patients mechanically ventilated in the lateral decubitus position. EIT measured parameters may be used to determine optimal ventilation parameters in these patients with inhomogeneous lung mechanics. Further studies are needed in patients with various lung pathologies.

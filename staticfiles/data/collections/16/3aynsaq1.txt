Background/Definition of the Problem: In recent years, postoperative management has changed towards rapid mobilisation, early oral feeding and rapid rehabilitation (known as Fast-Track or Enhanced Recovery Concepts). This study analysed the postoperative length of stay after vaginal hysterectomy in 3 different periods of time. Material and Methods: In the period October 2011 - September 2012, 75 patients underwent vaginal hysterectomies (Â± adnexectomy); another 114 vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomies with additional operations (e.g. prolapse surgery and incontinence surgery) and malignancies were not included. The time periods August 1995 - July 1996 (n = 50) and October 1996 - September 1997 (n = 96) served as a comparison. Reducing the length of stay was not an explicit goal. Results: The median postoperative stay was shortened from 7 (5-9) to 5 (3-15) or 3 (0-5) days (p < 0.001). The recovery rate remained unchanged at 2.7 % (n = 2), cf. 2 % (n = 1) and 3.1 % (n = 3). In 40/75 cases (53.3 %), the surgery took place on the day of admission. Conclusion: The length of hospital stay after vaginal hysterectomy has more than halved since 1995/1996 and continues to decline. This development occurred without a shortened stay being an explicit goal of the clinic. The shortened length of stay does not appear to have a negative impact on postoperative complications and recovery rate.

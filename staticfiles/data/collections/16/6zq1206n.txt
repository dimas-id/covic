Fireworks algorithm (FWA) is an emerging swarm intelligence inspired by the phenomenon of fireworks explosion. The numbers of sparks generated by fireworks have a great impact on the algorithm performance. It is widely accepted that promising fireworks should generate more sparks. However, in many researches, the quality of a firework is judged only on its current fitness value. This work proposes a Learning Automata-based Fireworks Algorithm (LA-FWA) introduced Learning automata (LA) to assign sparks for a better algorithm performance. Sparks are assigned to fireworks according to a state probability vector, which is updated constantly based on feedbacks from an environment so that it accumulates historical information. The probability vector converges as the search proceeds so that the local search ability of the LAFWA turns strong in the late search stage. Experimental results performed on CEC2013 benchmark functions show that the LAFWA outperforms several pioneering FWA variants.

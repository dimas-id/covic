BACKGROUND: Early life viral infection is associated with neurogenic inflammation that is present in lymphoid tissues of the upper airway in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We hypothesized that viral genomic material is present in tonsils of children with OSA. Therefore, we examined tonsils for the presence of respiratory viruses' nucleic acids in children with OSA, and in children without OSA (undergoing surgery for recurrent throat infections (RI)). METHODS: Tonsillar tissue from patients with OSA and RI was subjected to multiplex quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR (mqRTPCR), analyzed for the presence of common respiratory viruses' genetic material. RESULTS: Fifty‐six patients were included, of whom 34 had OSA (age (years ± S.D), 4.22 ± 1.14) and 22 with RI (4.35 ± 1.36). Respiratory viruses nucleic acids (24 detections) were observed in 17 (50%) OSA samples. In contrast, no virus was detected in RI samples (relative frequency P < 0.0001). Viruses detected, based on frequency were Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and corona virus. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are detected in OSA hypertrophic tonsils, suggestive of their role in the evolution of tonsillar inflammation and hypertrophy. Early life viral infections may contribute to the pathogenesis of pediatric OSA. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2015; 50:187–195. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Wrist-based fall detection system provides a very comfortable and multi-modal healthcare solution, especially for elderly risking falls. However, the wrist location presents a very challenging and unstable spot to distinguish falls among other daily activities. In this paper, we propose a Supervised Dictionary Learning approach for wrist-based fall detection. Three Dictionary learning algorithms for classification are invoked in this study, namely SRC, FDDL, and LRSDL. To extract the best descriptive representation of the signal data we followed different preprocessing scenarios based on accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. A considerable overall performance was obtained by the SRC algorithms reaching respectively 99.8%, 100%, and 96.6% of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using raw data provided by a triaxial accelerometer, accordingly overthrowing previously proposed methods for wrist placement.

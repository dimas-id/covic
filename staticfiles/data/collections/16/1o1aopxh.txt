Avian astroviruses comprise a diverse group of viruses affecting many avian species and causing enteritis, hepatitis, and nephritis. To date, six different astroviruses have been identified in avian species based on the species of origin and viral genome characteristics: two turkey-origin astroviruses [Turkey Astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1) and type 2 (TAstV-2)]; two chicken-origin astroviruses [Avian Nephritis Virus (ANV) and Chicken Astrovirus (CAstV)]; and two duck-origin astrovirus [Duck Astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) and type 2 (DAstV-2)]. ANV has also been detected in turkeys, ducklings, pigeons, and guinea fowl; and TAstrovirus-2-like viruses have also been found in guinea fowl. Astroviruses are commonly associated with enteric disease syndromes in poultry including runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex or syndrome (PEC or PES), poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS), and enteritis in guinea fowl. The molecular characterization of the different avian astroviruses shows great genetic variability among each type, and this variability influences the ability to detect these viruses by molecular and serological techniques. In this chapter, we review the different aspects related to avian astroviruses, including molecular biology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and control.

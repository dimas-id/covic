The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. COVID-19 is predominantly considered as an unavoidable pandemic, and scientists are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available. There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes. Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks. Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation. These masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well. In the absence of vaccination, productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases.

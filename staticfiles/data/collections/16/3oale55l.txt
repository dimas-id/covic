BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE Endovascular treatment of geometrically complex bifurcation aneurysms using a standard Y-configured stenting technique might be extremely difficult, particularly in aneurysms with daughter branches that acutely arise from the aneurysm sac itself. In those cases, deployment of the second stent through interstices of the first stent could be troublesome because of untoward angular changes in the vascular bifurcation prompted by angular changes resulting from placement of the first stent. Here, we describe a novel application of the buddy wire technique to facilitate Y-configured stenting in middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysms with unfavorable anatomic configuration. CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 60-year-old man with a left-sided MCA bifurcation aneurysm was treated using the buddy wire technique. In addition to the standard Y-configured stenting procedure, we also inserted a 0.014-inch exchange microguidewire into the superior daughter branch, which more acutely emanated from the sac, to attain a favorable bifurcation configuration before deployment of the stents in the Y configuration. The new technique was successful, and the postprocedural course of the treatment was uneventful. CONCLUSION Use of a buddy wire in MCA bifurcation aneurysms with unfavorable anatomic configurations may be a promising method to facilitate Y-configured stent placement.

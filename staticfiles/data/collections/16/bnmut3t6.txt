The pathogenicity of three different type 2 turkey astroviruses (TAstV-2) was studied in specific pathogen free turkeys. These viruses differ based on sequence analysis of the capsid gene. Poults were inoculated at 2 days of age and examined during 14 days for clinical signs and virus shedding. All inoculated poults presented signs of enteric disease including diarrhoea and growth depression. Virus presence and shedding was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from intestinal contents and cloacal swabs collected at 3, 7 and 14 days post-inoculation. Viraemia was also confirmed by this method. Common lesions observed at necropsy were dehydration; distended intestines filled with watery contents and undigested feed, and dilated caeca with foamy contents. Microscopic lesions present in the intestines consisted of mild crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration, and were most common in the jejunum. Presence of the viruses was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and by in situ hybridization in both villi and crypt enterocytes in the jejunum and, less frequently, the duodenum, ileum and caeca. Mild lesions consisting mainly of lymphocytic infiltration were also observed in other organs including the pancreas, liver, spleen and kidneys. Mild to moderate bursal atrophy occurred in all TAstV-2-infected poults examined; however, no specific viral staining was observed in this organ or any other tissues examined apart from the intestines. In conclusion, TAstV-2 viruses with variant capsids produce a similar enteric disease in young turkeys and may also affect the immune system of the birds by causing bursal lymphoid depletion.

PURPOSE Acute basilar artery occlusion is associated with high rates of major morbidity and mortality. In rare cases, the underlying pathology is a high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. We report on a series of seven cases with occluded high-grade basilar artery stenosis who received endovascular therapy at our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS Our prospective database since October 2009 until September 2013 was screened for patients with acute basilar artery occlusion and underlying high-grade stenosis who underwent endovascular therapy. Case files were retrospectively reviewed for clinical, outcome, and technical data. RESULTS Seven patients were identified who suffered from an acute basilar artery occlusion based on a high-grade stenosis between October 2009 and September 2013. These patients were treated with an acute stenting of the basilar artery with or without a preceding mechanical thrombectomy. Median age was 75 (53-83) years; median prethrombectomy National Institute of Health Stroke scale score was 19 (7-28). A successful recanalization result defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction grade 2b or higher was achieved in all cases. Two of the seven patients had a procedural complication consisting of a vessel dissection after angioplasty. A good clinical outcome according to the Solitaire flow restoration device versus the Merci Retriever in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (SWIFT) study criteria was achieved in three of the seven patients. One patient died during hospitalization in the acute phase. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy combined with acute stenting of the basilar artery is technically feasible and may be an effective therapeutic option in the rare case of an acutely occluded high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery in patients with an otherwise poor prognosis.

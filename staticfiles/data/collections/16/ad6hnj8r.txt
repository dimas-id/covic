Systems biology depends on a comprehensive assignment and characterization of the interactions of proteins and polypeptides (functional proteomics) and of other classes of biomolecules in a given organism. High‐capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening, but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries, affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry, and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies, the applications of ACE span from low‐affinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity, e.g., in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies, e.g., for fast processing immunoassay. Also, approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte–ligand interaction for drug, immunoassay, and aptamer development are increasingly important, but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research. In addition, the present overview emphasizes that distinct challenges regarding sensitivity, parallel processing, information‐rich detection, interfacing with MS, analyte recovery, and preparative capabilities remain. This will be addressed by future technological improvements that will ensure continuing new applications of ACE in the years to come.

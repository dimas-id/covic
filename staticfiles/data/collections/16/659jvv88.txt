Two cats with abdominal effusion and anorexia were diagnosed as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). We tried to evaluate the effect of thromboxane (Tx) synthetase inhibitor, ozagrel hydrochloride, on the progression of symptoms and clinicopathologic data characteristic to FIP. After administration of Tx synthetase inhibitor, improvement of appetite and activity, decreases of peritoneal effusion, reduction of leukocyte number to normal level, and improvement of hyper gamma-globulinemia were found in 2 cats with FIP. These findings suggest that the vasculitis in FIP can be successfully treated with Tx synthetase inhibitor which inhibits platelet aggregation.

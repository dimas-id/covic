Intravenous thrombolysis is the standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, patients with cancer who have stroke are often precluded from therapy because of coagulopathy or recent surgery. Endovascular therapy may be a more suitable recanalization strategy for some patients with cancer and stroke, but no prior detailed reports documenting its use in this population exist. We present a case series from a tertiary care referral center of 2 patients with active systemic cancer who were successfully treated with endovascular therapy for AIS. Both patients had active lung cancer with excellent premorbid functional status and presented with severe AIS from left middle cerebral artery occlusions. Intravenous thrombolysis was deferred because of absolute contraindications. Mechanical embolectomy was performed instead and revascularization was achieved within 5 hours in both patients, resulting in dramatic neurological recoveries-National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improved from 14 to 0 and from 23 to 3 from admission to discharge, respectively. In conclusion, endovascular therapy may be beneficial for select patients with cancer and AIS who are ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis. However, further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of endovascular therapy in the population with cancer.

Abstract: For many years it was thought that T lymphocytes recognized only peptide antigens presented by MHC class I or class II molecules. Recently, it has become clear that a wide variety of lipids and glycolipids are also targets of the T cell response. This novel form of cell‐mediated immune recognition is mediated by a family of lipid binding and presenting molecules known as CD1. The CD1 proteins represent a small to moderate sized family of β2‐microglobulin‐associated transmembrane proteins that are distantly related to MHC class I and class II molecules. They are conserved in most or all mammals, and control the development and function of T cell populations that participate in innate and adaptive immune responses through the recognition of self and foreign lipid antigens. Here we review the current state of our understanding of the structure and function of CD1 proteins, and the role of CD1‐restricted T cell responses in the immune system.

Since rhinosinusitis is an inflammatory disease, cytokines as key regulators of inflammation play a central role in its pathophysiology. In acute rhinosinusitis, several proinflammatory cytokines of different types have been identified. Initial information about the involvement of the inflammasome in rhinosinusitis has been gained, but this area remains open for more detailed research. Although it has been accepted now that chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) needs to be differentiated into CRS with and without nasal polyps, it has become clear that this distinction is insufficient to clearly define subgroups with uniform pathophysiology and cytokine patterns. While Th1-cytokines are mostly found in CRSsNP and Th2 cytokines in CRSwNP, there is a substantial overlap, and several other cytokines have also been detected. Attempts to identify CRS endotypes based on cytokines are ongoing but not yet generally accepted. Despite the central role of cytokines in rhinosinusitis, no specific cytokine-targeted therapies are currently available, and only very few studies have specifically addressed the effects of such biologicals in rhinosinusitis.

The incidence of allergies and asthma in the Western world has been increasing over the past 30 years. However, more recent data suggests that over the past 5–10 years, the overall global trends of asthma incidence have begun to stabilize (1). Urbanization and industrialization has contributed to the increase in developed countries, but the reasons for this are still unclear. Asthma is estimated to be responsible for 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide. Many of these deaths are preventable, and specific issues have been identified that may contribute to this high mortality rate. Factors that contribute to high ­mortality and morbidity include slow access to care and medications, inadequate environmental control of allergens and irritants, dietary changes, genetic variations, cultural barriers, lack of education amongst patients and providers, insufficient resources, and improper use of health care dollars.

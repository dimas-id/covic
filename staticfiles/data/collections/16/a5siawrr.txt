WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: There has been astounding progress made in the treatment of disease over recent years. This progress is particularly marked in cell therapy and in the personalization of therapy based on genetic insight, an approach known as genomic medicine. Our objective is to comment on the progress made in cell and genomic medicine against an historical backcloth of the search for rejuvenation. COMMENT: In 1741, close to seven decades after Antoine van Leeuwenhoek first saw his microscopic animalcules, Abraham Trembley, a tutor in Leiden, reported on an organism that could regenerate itself. The strange organism was thought to hold the secret of life. If it does, we have yet to prise the secret out. However, the ensuing study of cell programming and induced stem cells has shed considerable light on cellular development and provided new insights on the rejuvenative capacity of organisms. Inventive scientists have provided a deeper understanding of cell replication and, from this, developed new medicines for an increasing range of diseases. Targeted therapies, oligonucleotide therapy, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and pharmacogenetics are all new therapeutic areas originating from the improved insights. More will surely follow. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Immortality is for the gods, but man's search for its elusive secrets, perhaps as old as man himself, will continue. Huge leaps have been made, and effective medicines have been developed from our improved insights into the mechanism of life. However, only the foolish will predict how far this new knowledge will lead us, and more particularly, at what speed new therapies will follow.

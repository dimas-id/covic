Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse and complex and include acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis masquerading as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, pericarditis and pericardial effusion. We present 2 cases of COVID-19 infection with myocardial involvement with distinct mechanistic pathways and outcomes. Important decision strategies such as the timing of cardiac catheterization (when indicated) and requirement of early hemodynamic support in critically ill patients are discussed.

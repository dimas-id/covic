Serological surveys in Norway have demonstrated neutralising antibodies against bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) virus in cattle, sheep and goats. The prevalences were 18.5%, 4.5% and 3.6%, respectively. Occurrence of pestivirus-induced disease in Norway is described. Outbreaks of reproductive failure and mucosal disease have been reported, and the number of persistently-infected animals detected has increased considerably in recent years. Acute BVD occurs rarely. Border disease (BD) in sheep, first diagnosed in 1981, has subsequently been demonstrated sporadically. In goats, typical BD was diagnosed in 1982, with three later occurrences of reproductive failure. Experimental infections in pregnant goats induced a high rate of severe foetopathogenic effect. Signs and lesions in offspring were comparable to ovine BD. Similar findings were demonstrated in goats given a pestivirus-contaminated vaccine. In newborn kids, experimental infection had an adverse influence on growth and health. Persistent infection in goats is probably rare.

The levels of metallic trace elements were determined in fishery products sampled from Tunisian fishing ports. Mean concentrations were 0.20 ± 0.01, 0.05 ± 0.01, and 0.10 ± 0.01 mg/kg in fish flesh for Hg, Cd, and Pb, respectively. The mean concentrations of these elements were below regulatory thresholds; however, we also detected some specimens with higher levels. The mercury level showed a significant difference between fish categories, region, and year of sampling (p < 0.05). Samples from the center sites had the highest levels of Pb (0.17 ± 0.03 mg/kg; range 0.10; 0.22 mg/kg). Temporal analysis of Pb showed a significant difference between sampling year (p < 0.05). In addition, distribution among fish categories was statistically significant (p = 0.046). The rates of samples exceeding limits of Hg, Cd, and Pb were 5.3, 2.6, and 0.4%, respectively. Through the above results, the maximum weekly and monthly intakes for fish flesh consumption could not exceed the set limits. These data were important to inform consumers about fish content and the risk generated by some of these species.

Biofouling caused by the adhesion of respiratory microdroplets generated in sneezing and coughing plays an important role in the spread of many infectious diseases. Although water-repellent surfaces are widely used for the long-term repellency of aqueous solutions, their repellency to pathogen-containing microdroplets is elusive. In this work, microdroplets from picoliter to nanoliter were successfully generated in a controlled manner to mimic the exhaled microdroplets in sneezing and coughing, which allowed us to evaluate the adhesion of microdroplets on both superhydrophobic and lubricant-infused "slippery" surfaces for the first time. The impact and retention of water microdroplets on the two water-repellent surfaces are compared and investigated. Microdroplet-mediated surface biofouling and pathogen transmission were also demonstrated. Our results suggested that the adhesion of microdroplets should be duly considered in the design and application of water-repellent surfaces on biofouling prevention.

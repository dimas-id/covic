A heart transplant 62-year-old patient referred for Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. At admission he was febrile, tachypnoeic, and mild hypoxic with dry cough; during hospitalization a diffuse morbilliform skin rash appeared. He was treated with tocilizumab with symptoms improvement, without a complete pulmonary function recovery. Skin rash, highly suggestive for COVID-19 cutaneous involvement, persisted for ten days despite tocilizumab administration.

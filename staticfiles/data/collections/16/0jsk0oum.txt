Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease and can spread its infections to the central nervous and other systems with severe consequences. The replication of EV71 depends on its 3C proteinase (3Cpro ), a significant drug target. By X-ray crystallography and functional assays, the interactions between inhibitors and EV71 3Cpro were evaluated. It was shown that improved interactions at S4 for the substrate binding could significantly enhance the potency. A new series of potent inhibitors with high ligand efficiency was generated for developing antivirals to treat and control the EV71-associated diseases. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

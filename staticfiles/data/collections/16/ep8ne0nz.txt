In this paper, we designed, built, and tested a novel single-port access laparoscopic surgery (SPA) specific camera system. This device (magnet camera) integrates a light source and video camera into a small, inexpensive, portable package that does not compete for space with the surgical tools during SPA. The device is inserted through a 26-mm incision in the umbilicus, followed by the SPA port, which is used to maintain an insufflation seal and support the insertion of additional tools. The camera, now in vivo, remains separate from the SPA port, thereby removing the need for a dedicated laparoscope, and, thus, allowing for an overall reduction in SPA port size or the use of a third tool through the insertion port regularly reserved for the traditional laparoscope. The SPA camera is mounted to the abdominal ceiling using one of the two methods: fixation to the SPA port through the use of a rigid ring and cantilever bar, or by an external magnetic handle. The purpose of the magnet camera system is to improve SPA by: 1) eliminating the laparoscope SPA channel; 2) increasing the field of view through enhanced camera system mobility; and 3) reducing interference between the camera system and the surgical tools at the port, both in vivo and ex vivo.

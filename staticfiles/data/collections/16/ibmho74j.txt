This study investigated the relationship between endothelial pyroptosis and the occurrence of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatic hemangiomas. Thirty-two patients with hepatic hemangiomas were treated with RF ablation and blood samples of the patients were collected at different time points. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed to evaluate the expression of caspase-1, gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-1β and IL-18 in hepatic hemangioma and subablated hemangioma tissue. In vitro experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with sub-ablative hyperthermia with or without the addition of caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CMK in the medium. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1 and GSDMD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time PCR and Western blot methods. An elevation of general SIR parameters (CRP and WBC), pyroptosis-related inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) and LDH were observed 1-day post-RF ablation and their peak values were significantly correlated with ablated volume (p < .001) and ablation time (p < .001). Moreover, levels of pyroptosis-related inflammatory cytokines correlated well with general SIR parameters, respectively (p < .001). Immunohistochemical analysis showed the increased expression of caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18 and IL-1β in the endothelial cells of subablated hemangioma. In vitro experiments showed that subablative hyperthermia induced the caspase-1-associated endothelial pyroptosis and Ac-YVAD-CMK attenuated pyroptosis. In conclusion, SIR in patients treated by RF ablation for hepatic hemangiomas was significantly associated with the ablated volume and ablation time and endothelial pyroptosis may involve in the occurrence of SIR following RF ablation of hepatic hemangiomas.

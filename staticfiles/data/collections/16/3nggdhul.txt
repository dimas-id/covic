The novel coronavirus strain known as SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the world creating distinct challenges to the healthcare workforce. Coagulopathy contributing to significant morbidity in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 has now been well documented. We discuss two cases selected from patients requiring critical care in April 2020 in New York City with a unique clinical course. Both cases reveal significant thrombotic events noted on imaging during their hospital course. Obtaining serial inflammatory markers in conjunction with anti-phospholipid antibody testing revealed clinically significant Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This case series reviews the details preceding APS observed in SARS-CoV-2 and aims to report findings that could potentially further our understanding of the disease.

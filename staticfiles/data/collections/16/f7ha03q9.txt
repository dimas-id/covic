The complaint of rhinitis is one of the most frequent reasons why patients seek a physician's evaluation. Rhinitis is an inflammatory response of the nasal mucosa to various stimuli (both allergic or nonallergic). It is characterized by symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, nasal pruritis, and rhinorrhea.(49) The prevalence of rhinitis and the economic impact for both patient and managed care organizations dictate that clinicians carefully consider the medications available to them.

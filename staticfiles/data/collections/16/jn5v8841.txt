AIM We investigated if residual force depression (rFD) is present during voluntary fixed-end contractions of human tibialis anterior (TA) and whether reducing TA's activation level after active shortening could reduce rFD. METHODS Ten participants performed fixed-end dorsiflexion contractions to a low, moderate or high level while electromyography (EMG), dorsiflexion force and TA ultrasound images were recorded. Contractions were force- or EMG-matched and after the low or high contraction level was attained, participants respectively increased or decreased their force/EMG to a moderate level. Participants also performed moderate level contractions while the TA muscle-tendon unit (MTU) was lengthened during the force/EMG rise to the reference MTU length. RESULTS Equivalent fascicle shortening over moderate and low to moderate level contractions did not alter EMG (P = 0.45) or dorsiflexion force (P = 0.47) at the moderate level. Greater initial fascicle shortening magnitudes (1.7 mm; P ≤ 0.01) to the high contraction level did not alter EMG (P = 0.45) or dorsiflexion force (P = 0.30) at the subsequent moderate level compared with moderate level contractions. TA MTU lengthening during the initial force/EMG rise reduced TA fascicle shortening (-2.5 mm; P ≤ 0.01), which reduced EMG (-3.9% MVC; P < 0.01) and increased dorsiflexion force (3.7% MVC; P < 0.01) at the moderate level compared with fixed-end moderate level contractions. CONCLUSION rFD is present during fixed-end dorsiflexion contractions because fascicles actively shorten as force/EMG increases and rFD can be reduced by reducing the effective MTU compliance. A reduction in muscle activation level also reduces rFD by potentially triggering residual force enhancement-related mechanisms as force drops and some fascicles actively lengthen.

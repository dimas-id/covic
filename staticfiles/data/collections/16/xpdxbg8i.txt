INTRODUCTION: The crisis in the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus causing COVID-19 is putting health systems around the world to the test In a great effort to standardize the management and treatment guidelines, the different health authorities and scientific associations have tried to issue recommendations on how to act in this new and complex scenario OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the existing evidence and recommendations about urological emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic situation Furthermore, we propose a general action protocol for these patients MATERIAL AND METHODS: The document is based ont he scarce evidence on SARS / Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in the management of COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Madrid and the Basque Country A web and PubMed search was performed using the keywords "SARS-CoV-2", "COVID19", "COVID Urology", "COVID19 surgery" and "emergency care" A narrative review of the literature was carried out until April 30, 2020, including only articles and documents written in Spanish and English After the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors on May 12, 2020 RESULTS: General principles of action are set out, as well as specific recommendations for the most frequent urgent urological procedures CONCLUSIONS: Given the exceptional nature of the situation, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of the patient with urgent urological pathology The information is changing, as the epidemiological knowledge of the disease advances The establishment of multidisciplinary surgical committees that develop and implement action protocols appropriate to the different resources and particular situations of each center is recommended Likewise, these committees must individually assess each possible urological surgical emergency situation and ensure compliance with protective measures for the patient and other healthcare personnel

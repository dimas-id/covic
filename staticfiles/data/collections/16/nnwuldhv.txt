Acute aortofemoral graft occlusion is often effectively treated with endovascular therapy but a substantial proportion of patients experience failure or complications of this therapy, and most of them require definitive surgery for the underlying inflow, outflow, or graft disease. We describe a case of an aortofemoral graft occlusion that was successfully treated with the Trellis thrombectomy-thrombolysis system (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). Subsequent stenting of the graft obviated the need for a definitive graft revision surgery. The Trellis system combines mechanical and local pharmacologic lysis of the thrombus, with more rapid and more effective thrombus dissolution and theoretically less risk of systemic dispersion of the thrombolytic agent and less bleeding.

BACKGROUND: We performed an assessment of an independent rapid flu clinic service (RFCS) unit, which was set up outside the emergency department (ED) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic season. The unit was able to relieve the crowding of regular ambulatory and emergency services. METHODS: Between August and December 2009, a total of 6,152 patients with influenza-like illness were enrolled in this observational retrospective study. Patients with positive influenza tests were interviewed to evaluate the efficiency of RFCS. RESULTS: The mean length of stay (LOS) for the RFCS was 50 minutes, which was shorter than the LOS for ambulatory services (1 hour) and regular ED services (3.5 hours). Overall, 88% of patients were satisfied with the RFCS. Of 6,152 patients receiving flu tests, 1,235 (20%) had a positive result. Fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.11-5.89), fever combined with cough and sore throat (OR, 2.52; 95% CI: 2.18-2.92), fever combined with sore throat (OR, 2.42; 95% CI: 2.13-2.75), history of contacting confirmed flu patients within 7 days (OR, 2.40; 95% CI: 2.07-2.78), fever combined with cough (OR, 2.19; 95% CI: 1.92-2.47), sore throat (OR, 2.03, 95% CI: 1.79-2.30); and cough (OR, 1.91, 95% CI: 1.69-2.17) were significantly associated with positive influenza tests. CONCLUSION: Setting up the RFSC was beneficial to health care facilities during a pandemic flu season.

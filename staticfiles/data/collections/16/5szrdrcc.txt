INTRODUCTION: In light of the current Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing, extensive debate about the use of biological agents in psoriatic patients, we felt compelled to relate our experience in the use of secukinumab in the same cohort before and during the lockdown in Italy. Areas covered: Secukinumab was not discontinued, and there were no cases of confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort. Expert opinion: In our practice, there is no evidence favoring the discontinuation of secukinumab in these patients. We also present a brief commentary on the use of biological agents in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

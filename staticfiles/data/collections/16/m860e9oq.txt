Although the major isoform of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the healthy adult CNS is the 18.5-kDa protein, other isoforms containing exon 2 encoded protein (21.5 kDa and 20.2 kDa) exist and are expressed primarily during myelin formation. Since remyelination is a prominent feature in MS lesions, we examined the frequencies of T cell lines (TCLs) specific for epitopes within exon 2 encoded MBP (X2MBP), and also within 18.5-kDa MBP, in members of a multiplex family with MS. TCLs specific for X2MBP were as prevalent as TCLs specific for immunodominant epitopes within 18.5-kDa MBP. In addition, while frequencies of TCLs specific for 18.5-kDa MBP were no different between the affected and unaffected, the frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs correlated with disease.

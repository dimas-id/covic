Osteonecrosis, which is typically induced by trauma, glucocorticoid abuse, or alcoholism, is one of the most severe diseases in clinical orthopedics. Osteonecrosis often leads to joint destruction, and arthroplasty is eventually required. Enhancement of bone regeneration is a critical management strategy employed in osteonecrosis therapy. Bone tissue engineering based on engineered three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds with appropriate architecture and osteoconductive activity, alone or functionalized with bioactive factors, have been developed to enhance bone regeneration in osteonecrosis. In this review, we elaborate on the ideal properties of 3D scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration in osteonecrosis, including biocompatibility, degradability, porosity, and mechanical performance. In addition, we summarize the development of 3D scaffolds alone or functionalized with bioactive factors for accelerating bone regeneration in osteonecrosis and discuss their prospects for translation to clinical practice.

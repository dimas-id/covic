Background: In this study, biomechanical strength and bulkiness of the cow-hitch technique and Pulvertaft weave were compared. Our goal was to investigate whether the cow hitch can withstand equal strength in comparison with the Pulvertaft and to see if there is a difference in bulk, which could enhance gliding function and reduce friction and adhesion formation. Methods: Sheep tendons were used to perform 10 cow-hitch and 10 Pulvertaft repairs. Tensile strength was obtained with a cyclic loading tensile testing machine and tendon width and height measurements were obtained through digital analysis by photographs of the repairs. Results: The cow hitch showed significantly better ultimate strength and had less bulk. There was no statistical difference in displacement, defined as gain in total length of the tendon. Conclusions: The results in this study show that the cow hitch outperforms the Pulvertaft weave in both ultimate strength and bulk.

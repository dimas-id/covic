This paper describes eRisk, the CLEF lab on early risk prediction on the Internet. eRisk started in 2017 as an attempt to set the experimental foundations of early risk detection. Over the last three editions of eRisk (2017, 2018 and 2019), the lab organized a number of early risk detection challenges oriented to the problems of detecting depression, anorexia and self-harm. We review in this paper the main lessons learned from the past and we discuss our future plans for the 2020 edition.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although predominantly affecting countries across the Arabian Peninsula, the infection has been exported by travelers to countries around the world, including the United States. The virus has caused several healthcare-related outbreaks, so prompt recognition and patient isolation are critical to containing the spread of infection. Healthcare providers are urged to stay current on the evolving outbreak, and to screen at-risk travelers for possible MERS.

With the economic crisis an increase in suicidality has been reported across Europe but especially in Greece. Î¤hese reports hit the mass media headlines and were also included in the debate among political parties. The literature suggests that during periods of deep economic crisis, there is an increase specifically in suicides but causality remains unclear. The prevailing picture both in the scientific literature and in the mass media is that the economic crisis acts as a more or less generic risk factor on the entire population putting at risk literally anybody. Two recent studies clearly dispute it by reporting that suicides had increased several months before unemployment increased. Additionally and specifically concerning Greece, where the economic crisis is deeper and more prolonged, the detailed inspection of age and gender specific rates are not in accord with a "male gender" by "unemployment" interaction. Taking into consideration the above and since the rise in suicides also affects prospering countries without high unemployment, including Germany and Norway, another possible explanation is that the changes in the socioeconomic environment and especially in the employment conditions have overstressed vulnerable populations (e.g. mental patients) leading to the increased suicide rates. The problem is that in the majority of the literature the economic crisis/austerity is considered to be a generic risk factor affecting the entire population and subsequently generic horizontal measures are proposed. Unfortunately patients at risk to commit suicide are not considered as such; instead they are rather considered as normal healthy people from the general population who respond with suicide to generic adverse events.

BACKGROUND Retrorectal tumors (RTs) are rare in adults. Their surgical excision is often difficult because of their anatomic location. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of straight laparoscopic resection of RTs in our institution. METHODS Eight patients (six women and two men) with benign RTs were treated by laparoscopic resection in our tertiary care center between September 2012 and June 2013. Exclusion criteria included malignant tumors, lesions with fistula formation, and anterior sacral meningoceles. Clinical data, imaging features, operative details, pathological results, and treatment outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS Eight cases of benign RT with an average diameter of 8.9 ± 1.7 cm were treated by a straight laparoscopic procedure. The mean operative time was 122 ± 36 min, and the average intraoperative blood loss was 46 ± 33 ml. The median postoperative stay was 5 days (range 3-8 days), and all patients were discharged without serious complications. During a median follow-up of 11 months, no tumor recurrence was observed. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, a laparoscopic approach is safe for removing benign tumors in the retrorectal space. This approach may provide access to this difficult-to-reach space and has the advantages of allowing excellent visualization, meticulous dissection, less morbidities, and fast recuperation.

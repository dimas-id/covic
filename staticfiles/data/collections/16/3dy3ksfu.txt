At the present time, the whole world is faced with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19). Cutaneous manifestations in these patients are being increasingly reported, including rash, acrocyanosis or urticaria(1). Exanthemas in covid‐19 patients are becoming frequent in our daily practice and they pose a challenge regarding their pathogenesis. We present a retrospective case series of twelve adult patients (6 male/6 female) with a mean age of 66,3 years (47‐79). All patients had pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swab PCR positive for SARS CoV‐2 and had received treatment for Covid‐19 per protocol established. Table 1 shows the characteristics of these patients.

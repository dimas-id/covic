In the developing world, Nanotechnology became an efficient method in therapeutics, antimicrobials, diagnostics, catalysis, microelectronics, and high sensitivity biomolecular detection. As well as on the other hand, Exopolysaccharides are biopolymers which are also widely used in food formulation, bio- flocculants, bio-absorbents, drug delivery agents. As the chemical methods of synthesizing nanoparticles and polymers are environmentally risky, costly, and toxic. In the present study, we focused on production, purification, and characterization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and exopolysaccharide (EPS) by eco-friendly, extracellular biosynthetic methods using novel thermophilic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain Ts-1. This strain was isolated from soil samples by employing pour and spread plate techniques. After obtaining pure culture, the bacterium was used for the synthesis of AgNPs and EPS. Nanoparticles were synthesized from AgNO3 by using reducing agents secreted by bacteria, and Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis is carried out in three steps by the organism in the presence of a carbon source. Synthesis of colloidal AgNPs and EPS was monitored by UV-Visible spectroscopy and Visual observation, respectively. SEM, Edax and FTIR were performed for the characterization of the AgNPs and EPS such as their size, morphology and composition and we also showed the catalytic activity of AgNps in degradation of methylene blue.

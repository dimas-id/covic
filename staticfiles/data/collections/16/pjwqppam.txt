PURPOSE The aim of our study was to assess the impact of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy on pelvic symptoms, quality of life and sexual function in patients with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. Secondary goals included the assessment of anatomical correction, recurrence and complication rates. METHODS This is a prospective, single-center study that included 82 patients between 2009 and 2016. A clinical evaluation took place before surgery, and was repeated at 3, 12, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. Patients routinely received an anterior prosthesis, associated with a posterior prosthesis in case of symptomatic rectocele. Patients included self-administered questionnaires for functional pelvic problems (PFDI-20), quality of life (PFIQ-7), and sexual function (PISQ-12), and a clinical examination with POP-Q staging, at each medical visit. RESULTS Functional pelvic problems derived from prolapse (PFDI-20 scores) and their impact on patients' quality of life (PFIQ-7 score) significantly improved at 3, 12, 36 and 60 months postoperatively. Improvement on sexual activity was significant at 3 and 60 months postoperatively. Effective prolapse anatomical correction (POP-Q score < 2) was found in 94.4% and 97.2% of patients at the anterior and middle stages, respectively, at the end of follow-up, but only in 80.3% at the posterior stage. Symptomatic recurrence required surgical intervention in 4 patients (5.3%). CONCLUSIONS This long-term follow-up prospective analysis confirms the good functional and anatomical results of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for pelvic organ prolapse.

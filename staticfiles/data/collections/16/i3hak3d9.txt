BACKGROUND. In parts of Cambodia and in many other parts of the world, irrigation of rice with groundwater results in arsenic (As) accumulation in soil and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. At times, some As is present as relatively nontoxic, non-regulated, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Low levels of zinc (Zn) have been found in rice from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and China where As levels in rice are high. Furthermore, there have been claims that Zn deficiency is responsible for stunting the growth of children in Cambodia and elsewhere, however in rural Asia, rice is the major source of Zn. Current data are inadequate for both Zn and DMA in Cambodian rice. OBJECTIVES. The present study aimed to provide a preliminary evaluation of the relationship between the content of Zn and DMA in rice grain in Preak Russey, an area with elevated levels of As in groundwater and to improve the management of Zn deficiency in rice. METHODS. Rice agriculture was evaluated along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total As, and As species in rice and water were conducted by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analysis of total Zn and As in soils and total Zn in rice were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry. RESULTS. Rice in Preak Russey had Zn concentrations less than a third the level recommended by the United Nations World Food Programme. There was a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between the Zn content of rice and DMA in rice with the lowest Zn and highest DMA levels occurring near irrigation wells, the source of As. CONCLUSIONS. The highest levels of DMA in rice were associated with Zn deficiency in rice. COMPETING INTERESTS. The authors declare no competing financial interests

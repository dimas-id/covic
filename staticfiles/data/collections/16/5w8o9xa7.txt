BACKGROUND Oesophagoscopy with biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE). Therefore is important to discover less-invasive diagnostic methods. METHODS Cytology specimens were obtained in patients with active EoE (AEoE) (≥15 eos/hpf) and EoE in remission (EoER) (<15 eos/hpf). The samples were assessed by two independent pathologists and were compared with biopsy samples. EoE cytology specimens were compared with specimens obtained from patients with GERD. RESULTS Specimens of 36 patients (69.4% male, mean age 30.88 years) were included. AEoE (17, 47.2%), EoER (11, 30.5%) and GERD (22.2%). eos/hpf in cytology (AEoE 9.23 vs. EoER 1.54 vs. GERD 2, p = 0.01). Linear correlation between eos/hpf average biopsy and cytology eos/hpf: r = 0.57, p < 0.001. For diagnosis of EoE ≥3 eos/hpf in cytology obtained a sensitivity of 70%, specificity 81%, PPV 86% and NPV 60% (AUC = 0.81, p = 0.01). For detection of AEoE, ≥3 eos/hpf in LBC obtained a sensitivity of 70%, specificity 82%, PPV 81% and NPV 66% (AUC = 0.87, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS LBC in oesophageal aspirate seems to be effective for the diagnosis and monitoring activity in EoE. These results support the usefulness of non-invasive methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of EoE.

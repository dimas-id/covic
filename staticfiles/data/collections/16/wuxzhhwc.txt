BACKGROUND: Telehealth use has been increasing over the last decade. Studies have shown that patients have a positive attitude towards incorporating telehealth into their healthcare. Significant uncertainty remains over reimbursement policies that vary widely between states and by payer. OBJECTIVE: Explore the clinical, operational, and financial feasibility of a home telehealth (HTH) program in a pediatric Allergy & Immunology (A&I) clinic. METHODS: A&I Physicians defined use cases they deemed appropriate for HTH appointments. Established patients in the A&I clinic were approached to complete an attitudes and perception survey. Patients meeting the use case definitions were asked to participate in the pilot program. After their HTH appointment took place, they completed a validated satisfaction survey. Our institution’s revenue cycle management team provided reimbursement data. RESULTS: Patient attitudes toward HTH were generally favorable. 51 HTH appointments were offered and 46 appointments were made. 37 appointments were completed successfully among 32 unique patients. Patients were very satisfied with the HTH experience. 36 out of 37 encounters were reimbursed by 19 different public and private payers. Payers on average reimbursed ±6% of the expected allowable for an equivalent in-person visit. CONCLUSION: Patients showed reservations about HTH initially but were very satisfied with their experience. Both private and public payers reimbursed HTH the same as in-person appointments. HTH is both well accepted by patients and financially viable.

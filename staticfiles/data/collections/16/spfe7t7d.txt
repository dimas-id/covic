PURPOSE To study short- and intermediate-term global renal function in patients undergoing a single percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (pRFA) for a solitary renal parenchymal tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the records of 62 patients who underwent a single pRFA for solitary renal parenchymal tumor. We used the abbreviated Modified Diet for Renal Disease equation to calculate baseline, 1-month, and 1-year glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We defined normal as >60, moderately diminished as 45-60, and severely diminished GFR as <45 cc/minute/1.73 m². We used the Wilcoxon paired rank sum method to compare 1-month and 1-year GFR to baseline. We fit a linear regression model to test the association of lesion size to GFR controlling for lesion location and baseline GFR. RESULTS There was no difference in GFR from baseline at 1 month or 1 year (55 vs. 58 cc/minute/1.73 m², p=0.24 and 55 vs. 57 cc/minute/1.73 m², p=0.8, respectively). Tumor size did not affect GFR at 1 month or 1 year after controlling for lesion location and baseline GFR. CONCLUSIONS A single application of pRFA does not affect GFR in the short or intermediate term.

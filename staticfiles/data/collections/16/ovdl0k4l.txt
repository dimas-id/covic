EXPERT OPINION We will remember the dawn of the third decade of the twenty-first century as a time when the world changed, the true scale and impact of which is hard for us to imagine. Like a phoenix from the ashes though, COVID-19 provides us with a great learning opportunity to renew insights into ourselves as individuals, our clinical teams, and the optimized provision of care for our patients. COVID-19 has re-shaped and re-focused our collective societal values, with a sea-changed shift from materialistic to human-centric, from self-centredness to altruism, ultimately for the betterment of patient care and the whole of society.

BACKGROUND Most of the laparoscopic surgeons have been attempting to reduce incisional morbidity and improve cosmetic outcomes by using fewer and smaller ports. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a new laparoscopic procedure. Herein we would like to present our experiences. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2009 and October 2009, data of the 32 patients who were operated through SILS are evaluated prospectively. There were 22 females and 10 males with a mean age of 45.1Â±14.8 years. Ten splenectomies for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, 16 cholecystectomies for acute cholecystitis or asymptomatic gallstones, 3 appendectomies for acute appendicitis, one distal pancreatosplenectomy for Renal Cell Cancer metastases, 1 adrenalectomy for Conn Syndrome and 1 case of liver resection for hepatic adenoma were carried out. The most common splenectomy indication was idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, cholecystectomy indication was acute cholecystitis (n=8), and asymptomatic cholelithiasis (n=8), appendectomy indication was acute appendicitis, distal pancreatosplenectomy indication was renal cell cancer metastases, adrenalectomy indication was Conn syndrome and liver resection indication was left hepatic mass in between segments 1 and 2. SILS was carried out successfully in 31 patients. Only in 1 patient conversion was required owing to bleeding. RESULTS All procedures were carried out through a 2-cm umbilical incision. There was no mortality and morbidity recorded. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands of minimally invasive surgeons, SILS incision laparoscopic surgery could be carried out successfully in a wide range of surgical operations. However, to be able to show the differences between Standard laparoscopic surgery and single SILS, prospective randomized comparative studies are required.

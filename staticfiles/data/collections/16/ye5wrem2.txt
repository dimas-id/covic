Reduced port surgery (RPS), in which fewer ports are used than that in a conventional laparoscopic procedure, is becoming increasingly popular for various surgeries. However, the application of RPS to the field of gastrectomy is still underdeveloped. We started laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy through an umbilical port plus another 5 mm port (dual port laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy: DP-LATG) as an RPS for laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG). A SILS™ port was inserted into an umbilical incision, while another 5 mm port was inserted at the right flank region. We performed DP-LATG on ten early gastric cancer cases consecutively from May 2011 onwards, with the surgeries all performed by a single surgeon. The results of DP-LATG were compared with the resuls of ten conventional LATGs (C-LATGs) that were performed between March 2010 and April 2011. There were no significant differences in the mean operation time (DP-LATG, 253.0 ± 26.8 min; C-LATG, 235.5 ± 20.6 min; p = 0.119), mean blood loss (33.4 ± 23.7, 39.8 ± 60.4 mL, p = 0.759), and number of lymph nodes dissected (31.6 ± 12.3, 40.9 ± 18.7, p = 0.205). There were no intraoperative complications, there was no need for additional ports, and there were no conversions to open surgery nor postoperative complications in the DP-LATG cases. We successfully and safely performed DP-LATG without incurring any notable differences from C-LATG in terms of operation time, blood loss, and number of lymph nodes dissected.

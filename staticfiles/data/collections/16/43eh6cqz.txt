Abstract During the last decade, a variety of molecular assays targeting respiratory viruses have been developed and commercialized. Therefore, multiplex PCR are increasingly used in everyday clinical practice. This improves our understanding of respiratory virus epidemiology and enhances our concerns about their clinical impact in specific patient populations. However, questions remain regarding cost-effectiveness of performing these diagnostic tests in routine and their real impact on patient care. This article will review available data and highlight unresolved questions about cost-effectiveness, infection control, clinical utility and public health impact of multiplex respiratory virus assays.

The contribution of microbiota in regulating multiple physiological and pathological host responses has been studied intensively in recent years. Evidence suggests that commensal microbiota can directly modulate different populations of cells of the immune system (e.g., Ivanov et al., 2008; Atarashi et al., 2011). Recently, we showed that protein extracts from gut commensal microbiota can activate retina-specific T cells, allowing these autoreactive T cells to then break through the blood-retinal barrier and trigger autoimmune uveitis in the recipient (Horai et al., 2015). The protocol below describes the method to prepare intestinal protein-rich extracts that can be used in various in vitro andin vivo immunological studies.

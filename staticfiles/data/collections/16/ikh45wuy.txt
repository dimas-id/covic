Pseudomonas . Food antioxidants such as glutathione, vitamin E, and Î²-carotenes are important. Ingredients for the colonic mucosa are important. Approximately 10% of caloric need is satisfied by so-called colonic food (prebiotics), fermented at the level of the colonic mucosa to produce colonic mucosa nutrients and to prevent gut origin sepsis. More than 10 g of fiber per day is recommended. The fermenting flora (probiotic flora) is deranged owing to disease or antibiotic treatment, and resupply of flora is important. A new concept of ecoimmune nutrition is presented for enteral supply of mucosa-reconditioning ingredients: new surfactants, pseudomucus, fiber, amino acids such as arginine, and mucosa-adhering Lactobacillus plantarum 299.

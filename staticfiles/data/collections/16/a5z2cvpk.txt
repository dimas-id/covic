Between June and September 2013, sera from 11 dromedary camels, 150 goats, 126 sheep and 91 cows were collected in Jordan, where the first human Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cluster appeared in 2012. All sera were tested for MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) specific antibodies by protein microarray with confirmation by virus neutralisation. Neutralising antibodies were found in all camel sera while sera from goats and cattle tested negative. Although six sheep sera reacted with MERS-CoV antigen, neutralising antibodies were not detected.

Abstract Background Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) cause upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, most frequently among infants and young children, but also in the elderly. While seasonal patterns of HPIV types 1–3 have been described, less is known about national patterns of HPIV-4 circulation. Objectives To describe patterns of HPIVs circulation in the United States (US). Study design We used data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), a voluntary passive laboratory-based surveillance system, to characterize the epidemiology and circulation patterns of HPIVs in the US during 2011–2019. We summarized the number of weekly aggregated HPIV detections nationally and by US census region, and used a subset of data submitted to NREVSS from public health laboratories and several clinical laboratories during 2015–2019 to analyze differences in patient demographics. Results During July 2011 - June 2019, 2,700,135 HPIV tests were reported; 122,852 (5 %) were positive for any HPIV including 22,446 for HPIV-1 (18 %), 17,474 for HPIV-2 (14 %), 67,649 for HPIV-3 (55 %), and 15,283 for HPIV-4 (13 %). HPIV testing increased substantially each year. The majority of detections occurred in children aged ≤ 2 years (36 %) with fluctuations in the distribution of age by type. Conclusions HPIVs were detected year-round during 2011–2019, with type-specific year-to-year variations in circulation patterns. Among HPIV detections where age was known, the majority were aged ≤ 2 years. HPIV-4 exhibited an annual fall-winter seasonality, both nationally and regionally. Continued surveillance is needed to better understand national patterns of HPIV circulation.

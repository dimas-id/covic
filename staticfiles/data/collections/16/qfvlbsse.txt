Objective To provide data reference for later researchers to visually and conveniently recognize the key research areas of coronavirus, quickly find important literature and influential research partners by analyzing the research literature on coronavirus. Methods Data from the Web of Science Core Collection database were selected to systematically collate the literature on coronavirus research from 1968 to 2019, and the literature type distribution, annual number of papers, countries, institutions, journals, authors, literature co citation, and emerging key words were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2019 and CiteSpace 5.5.R2 software. Results As of December 31, 2019, a total of 13,959 papers on coronavirus have been published. Global coronavirus research is divided into three periods: The initial research period (1968-2003), the first golden development period (2004-2012) and the second golden development period (2013-2019). United States is the country with the largest number of publications; the University of Hong Kong is the institution with the largest number of publications, and the Journal of Virology ranks first in the number and influence of publications. Peiris JSM, Drosten C and Ksiazek TG are good partners in the field of coronavirus research. Conclusions "SARS-CoV", "infectious disease", "coronavirus spike protein" may attract close attention in the field of coronavirus research.

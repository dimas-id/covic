BACKGROUND : Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) has been suggested for obtaining high quality tissue samples from pancreatic tumors. We performed a multicenter randomized crossover trial comparing EUS-FNB with a 20G Procore needle vs. a 22G Acquire needle. The aims were to compare the quantity of targeted tissue (pancreas) and diagnostic accuracy for the two needles. METHODS : 60 patients admitted for EUS-FNB in three endoscopy units were included. One pass was performed consecutively with each needle, in a randomized order. Histologic material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the needle. The primary end point was mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass. RESULTS : Final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma (nâ=â46; 77â%), neuroendocrine neoplasm (nâ=â11; 18â%), autoimmune pancreatitis (nâ=â2), and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (nâ=â1). The mean cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was significantly higher with the 22G Acquire needle at 11.4âmm (95â% confidence interval [CI] 9.0â-â13.8] vs. 5.4âmm (95â%CI 3.8â-â7.0) for the 20G Procore needle (Pâ<â0.001), as was the mean surface area (3.5âmm2 [95â%CI 2.7â-â4.3] vs. 1.8âmm2 [95â%CI 1.2â-â2.3]; Pâ<â0.001). Diagnostic adequacy and accuracy were 100â% and 87â% with the 22G Acquire needle, and 82â% and 67â% with the 20G Procore needle (Pâ=â0.001 and Pâ=â0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS : EUS-guided biopsy of pancreatic masses with the 22G Acquire needle provided more tissue for histologic evaluation and better diagnostic accuracy than the 20G Procore needle.

In this paper, we introduce a variable-gain control strategy for mechanical ventilators in the respiratory systems. Respiratory systems assist the patients who have difficulty breathing on their own. For the comfort of the patient, fast pressure buildup (and release) and a stable flow response are desired. However, linear controllers typically need to balance between these conflicting objectives. In order to balance this tradeoff in a more desirable manner, a variable-gain controller is proposed, which switches the controller gain based on the magnitude of the patient flow. The effectiveness of the control strategy is demonstrated in experiments on different test lungs.

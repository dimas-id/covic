Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) is one of the most common and costly clinical conditions encountered in veterinary medicine in commercially kept pigs. In this introductory article (sponsored by Intervet/Schering Plough AH), the clinical presentation in both the individual pig and groups will be described, along with the pathological lesions encountered. The multiple aetiological factors involved in the syndrome, ranging from primary and secondary infectious agents to environmental and managemental factors will be explored. Diagnostic and monitoring methods are also discussed. Subsequent articles will look in detail at specific elements of the syndrome.

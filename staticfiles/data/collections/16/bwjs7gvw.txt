The ability of materials to dramatically change their properties at nanoscale has opened up the possibility of making new devices, instruments and consumer goods to function in a much better way than was possible earlier. We have seen in Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-319-09171-6_10 and 10.1007/978-3-319-09171-6_11 that nanomaterials have enabled us to design new products which were not possible using bulk materials. Rapid progress in the synthesis and understanding of nanomaterials in just a few years has led them to enter the world market in a big way. Figure 12.1 shows an overview of various fields in which nanomaterials have entered or are about to enter. In this chapter we shall briefly discuss some of these applications.

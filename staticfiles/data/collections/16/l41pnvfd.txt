Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged as a significant pathogen for humans and the cause for the recent outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) throughout the globe For developing any preventive measure, an understanding of the zoonotic pattern for this virus is a necessity We should have a clear knowledge of its reservoir host, its distribution pattern and spreading routes Information about zoonotic reservoirs and its transmission among them can help to understand the COVID-19 outbreaks In this article, we discuss about the bats as the zoonotic reservoir of several CoV strains, co-existence of bats and CoV/viruses, the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with bat SARS-like CoV, the probable source of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strain and COVID-19 outbreak, intermediate host of CoVs and SARS-CoV-2, human to human transmission and the possibility to maintain the zoonotic barriers Our knowledge about the zoonotic reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission ability may help develop the preventive measures and control for the future outbreak of CoV

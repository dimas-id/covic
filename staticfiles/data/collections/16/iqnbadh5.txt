Angiotensin-(1-7) is a vasoactive peptide of the reninâ€“angiotensin system (RAS), which is generated mainly by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and exerts its actions via activation of its receptor Mas. The Ang-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas axis is nowadays considered to be a main mechanism, which counterbalances the vasoconstrictive actions of classical RAS, which includes renin, ACE, ANG II, and its receptors AT(1) and AT(2). Whereas the classical RAS has been known for more than 100 years, the protective arm of the RAS was relatively recently discovered. Both Mas and Ang-(1-7) were first described almost 30 years ago; however, it took an additional 15 years until the interaction of these components was revealed. Here, we will describe the story of Mas and Ang-(1-7), which was full of errors and uncertainty at the beginning, until the interrelationship between the two was unveiled in 2003.

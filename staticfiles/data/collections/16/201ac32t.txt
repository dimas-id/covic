Aim: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2), a pernicious viral disease, causes acute respiratory distress responsible for mortality and morbidity worldwide. To screen different immunomodulatory medicinal compounds to unravel their interaction with SARS-COV-2 viral proteins. Materials & methods: A library of immunomodulatory medicinal compounds with antiviral capability were analyzed against SARS proteases, spike protein and nonstructural proteins (NSP-9, 15) using Autodock vina. Results: Out of more than 300 medicinal compounds, only six compounds: arzanol, ferulic acid, genistein, resveratrol, rosmanol and thymohydroquinone showed significant interaction with the SARS viral proteins by forming hydrogen bonds with the active site residues with low binding energy. Further ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) analysis showed good pharmacokinetic properties and low acute toxicity of these compounds. Conclusion: The current study provides convincing evidence that these medicinal compounds exert antiviral activity against the SARS-COV-2 virus and could be further exploited for the treatment of this disease.

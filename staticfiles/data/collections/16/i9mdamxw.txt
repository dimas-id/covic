Small regulatory RNAs and antisense RNAs play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria but are underexplored, especially in natural populations. While environmentally relevant microbes often are not amenable to genetic manipulation or cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, extensive metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets for these organisms might be available. Hence, dedicated workflows for specific analyses are needed to fully benefit from this information. Here, we identified abundant sRNAs from oceanic environmental populations of the ecologically important primary producer Prochlorococcus starting from a metatranscriptomic differential RNA-Seq (mdRNA-Seq) dataset. We tracked their homologs in laboratory isolates, and we provide a framework for their further detailed characterization. Several of the experimentally validated sRNAs responded to ecologically relevant changes in cultivation conditions. The expression of the here newly discovered sRNA Yfr28 was highly stimulated in low-nitrogen conditions. Its predicted top targets include mRNAs encoding cell division proteins, a sigma factor, and several enzymes and transporters, suggesting a pivotal role of Yfr28 in the coordination of primary metabolism and cell division. A cis-encoded antisense RNA was identified as a possible positive regulator of atpF encoding subunit b' of the ATP synthase complex. The presented workflow will also be useful for other environmentally relevant microorganisms for which experimental validation abilities are frequently limiting although there is wealth of sequence information available.

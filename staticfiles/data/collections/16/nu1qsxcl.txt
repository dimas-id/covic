Plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT), microneutralisation (MN), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-spike pseudoparticle neutralisation (ppNT) and MERS S1-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody titres were compared using 95 sera from 17 patients with MERS, collected two to 46 days after symptom onset. Neutralisation tests correlated well with each other and moderately well with S1 ELISA. Moreover to compare antigenic similarity of genetically diverse MERS-CoV clades, the response of four sera from two patients sampled at two time periods during the course of illness were tested by 90% PRNT. Genetically diverse MERS-CoV clades were antigenically homogenous.

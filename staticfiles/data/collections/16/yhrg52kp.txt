Mid-tracheal, postintubation stenosis can be managed with an extended length tracheostomy tube to bypass the stenotic area. However these extra-long tracheostomy tubes are not fenestrated, and when the stenotic tracheal lumen sits against the tracheostomy tube, phonation is not possible as there is no translaryngeal airflow. A 59-year-old man developed distal tracheal stenosis following a prolonged intubation and tracheostomy after a motorcycle accident. He eventually required an extra-long tracheostomy tube to bypass the stenotic region. We modified a silicone tracheostomy tube by creating a fenestration on its posterior wall. This relieved the obstruction while still allowing phonation and speech.

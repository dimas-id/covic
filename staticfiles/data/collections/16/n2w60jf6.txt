Fast, cheap and easy to use nucleic acids detection methods are crucial to mitigate adverse impacts caused by various pathogens, and are essential in forensic investigations, food safety monitoring or evolution of infectious diseases. We report here a method based on the α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore, working in conjunction to unmodified citrate anion-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), to detect nanomolar concentrations of short single-stranded DNA sequences (ssDNA). The core idea was to use charge neutral peptide nucleic acids (PNA) as hybridization probe for complementary target ssDNAs, and monitor at the single-particle level the PNA-induced aggregation propensity AuNPs during PNA–DNA duplexes formation, by recording ionic current blockades signature of AuNP–α-HL interactions. This approach offers advantages including: (1) a simple to operate platform, producing clear-cut readout signals based on distinct size differences of PNA-induced AuNPs aggregates, in relation to the presence in solution of complementary ssDNAs to the PNA fragments (2) sensitive and selective detection of target ssDNAs (3) specific ssDNA detection in the presence of interference DNA, without sample labeling or signal amplification. The powerful synergy of protein nanopore-based nanoparticle detection and specific PNA–DNA hybridization introduces a new strategy for nucleic acids biosensing with short detection time and label-free operation.

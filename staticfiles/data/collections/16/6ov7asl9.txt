PURPOSE To assess safety, technical success, local control, and survival associated with percutaneous image-guided adrenal ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with adrenal metastases who underwent percutaneous image-guided adrenal ablation during the years 2003-2012 were identified. There were 32 patients with 37 adrenal tumors identified. Technical success, safety, local control, and survival were analyzed according to standard criteria. RESULTS In 32 patients (25 men and 7 women; mean age, 66 y; age range, 44-88 y) with 37 adrenal tumors, 35 ablation procedures were performed. One patient with an 8.2-cm tumor underwent planned cryoablation debulking fully anticipating untreated margins owing to close proximity of the pancreas (ie, the intent was to diminish tumor burden rather than a curative intervention). Of the 36 patients treated with curative intent, technical success was achieved in 35 (97%) tumors. Follow-up imaging was performed on 34 of 37 tumors (excluding patients with intentional debulking [n = 1], technical failure [n = 1], and absence of follow-up [n = 1]). Local recurrence developed in 3 (8.8%) of 34 tumors. Local tumor control was achieved in 31 lesions at a mean of 22.7 months of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival at 36 months were 88% and 52%, respectively, with a median survival of 34.5 months. A Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 grade 3 or 4 complication was observed in three (8.6%) ablation procedures. CONCLUSIONS Image-guided ablation is safe and effective for local control of metastatic adrenal tumors and provides a minimally invasive alternative to surgical resection in appropriately selected patients.

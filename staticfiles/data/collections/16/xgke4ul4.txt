The COVID-19 disruption to 'business as usual' presents an opportunity for a profound change in oral healthcare experience for our patients and our profession. While the prospect of change has dominated professional dialogue for years, the post-COVID-19 era offers choices with respect to pace, proximity, preparedness, protection and equity. There is potential for a determined revision of the current activity-driven clinical approach, with the adoption of the minimally invasive oral care philosophy into routine practice and use of technology to remotely support our patients. Throughout COVID-19, the whole of the dental profession has demonstrated adaptability in redeployment and compassion in delivering care in a variety of settings. These vital traits and bold clinical leadership, prepared to make timely choices and act fast, will underpin our successful transition towards the safe resumption of routine dental services. In making the right choices, we have at hand a future integrated dental team care model with time to concentrate on personalised prevention advice, as well as the provision of effective, highly skilled treatment.

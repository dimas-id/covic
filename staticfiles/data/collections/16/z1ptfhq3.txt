BACKGROUND Incidence of obesity and related diseases are increasing in the world. Visceral surgeons are more often confronted with laparoscopic surgery in obese patients. Besides validated surgery procedures, such as cholecystectomy and gastroesophageal reflux surgery, bariatric procedures are increasingly performed. In obese patients, the thickness of adipose panicle makes open laparoscopy hazardous. METHODS In our department, we use systematically a technique of open laparoscopy in obese patients for supramesocolic surgery, which is safe, reproducible, and permits good closure of the abdominal wall. RESULTS The surgical technique consists of opening the abdominal wall through the rectus abdominis. Helped by specific retractors called Descottes (Medtronic Laboratory), both fascias are charged by sutures separately. Incision in the fascias is made safely by pooling on sutures. Introduction of port-site is made under view control. At the end of laparoscopy, closure of both fascias is easily done. CONCLUSIONS We present a technique of open laparoscopy in obese patients, systematically used, for supramesocolic surgery. This technique is safe, reproducible, and permits an efficient closure of the abdominal wall.

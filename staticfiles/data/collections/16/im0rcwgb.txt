PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 1st November 2013 and 30th June 2019 we performed 112 VATS lobectomies with isolated intubation and anterior approach. In 98 cases lobectomies were performed for malignant lesions, while in 9 cases for benign changes. 78 men and 34 women were operated on. The average age was 60.5 years (42-63). In 5 cases the left upper lobes were resected, in cases 36 the left lower lobes, in 15 cases the right upper lobes, in 11 cases the mid lobes, in 44 cases the right lower lobes, and in one case pneumonectomy was performed. RESULTS there was no postoperative mortality. Conversion was required in three 3 patients. The average time of surgery was 150 minutes (70-215). Re-operation was needed in two cases due to bleeding and air leakage. Out of the 112 operations, primary lung cancer was demonstrated on pathology in 88 cases, while benign lesions /inflammation in 9 cases. The stages of primary lung cancer were the following: I.a:57, I.b:22, II.a:6, II.b:3 patients. Tumour subtypes were the detailed as 52 adenocarcinoma, 23 squamous cell cc., 2 small cell cc., 5 large cell cc., and 6 carcinoid. 10 patients underwent VATS lobectomy for metastatic disease. CONCLUSION As a result of an adequate learning period, VATS lobectomies have become a routine surgery in our unit. Currently 65% of the thoracotomies and more than 50 percent of the lobectomies are performed by the VATS method. Our results are comparable to national as well as international data.

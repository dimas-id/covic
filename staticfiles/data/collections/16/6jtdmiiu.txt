Mechanical esophageal closure with stapler during total laryngectomy has been used by various authors to decrease the surgical time and pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) rates. In a few of the studies, surgical site infection (SSI) rates are mentioned and none of the studies emphasize the effect of decreased surgical time on postoperative cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. In this study, the authors compared the PCF rates, SSI rates, operation times between 30 mechanical stapler and 40 manual esophageal closure during total laryngectomy for laryngeal cancer patients. National Nasocomial Infections Surveillance system (NNISS) scores were recorded and compared between groups. Total laryngectomy and total operation times were lower in the stapler group patients (P < 0.001 for total laryngectomy time, P = 0.024 for total operation time). There were lower rates of pharyngocutaneous fistula (P = 0.032), surgical site infection (P = 0.019), and NNISS scores (P = 0.009) in the stapler group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding postoperative systemic complications (P = 0.451). In conclusion, stapler esophageal closure decreases operation time, PCF, SSI rates, and NNISS scores but not the systemic complication rates. Comorbid illnesses and prolonged surgical time are risk factors for postoperative systemic complications in total laryngectomy patients, but patients with additional illnesses must not encourage the surgeon to use stapler for decreasing postoperative systemic complications.

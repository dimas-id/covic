OBJECTIVES To evaluate the clinical performance of a new microwave ablation (MWA) system with enabled constant spatial energy control (ECSEC) to achieve spherical ablation zones in the treatment of liver malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, 56 hepatic tumours in 48 patients (23 men, 25 women; mean age: 59.6 years) were treated using a new high-frequency MWA-system with ECSEC. Parameters evaluated were technical success, technical efficacy, tumour diameter, tumour and ablation volume, complication rate, 90-day mortality, local tumour progression (LTP) at the 12-month follow-up, ablative margin and ablation zone sphericity. These parameters were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with the same parameters collected retrospectively from cohorts of patients treated with conventional high-frequency (HF) MWA (n = 20) or low-frequency (LF) MWA (n = 20). RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all interventions. The technical efficacy was 100% (ECSEC) vs. 100% (LF-MWA) vs. 95% (HF-MWA). There were no intra-procedural deaths or major complications. Minor complications occurred in 3.57% (2/56), 0% (0/20) and 0% (0/20) of the patients, respectively. The one-year mortality rate was 16.1% (9/56), 15% (3/20) and 10% (2/20), respectively. The LTP was 3.57% (2/56), 5% (1/20) and 5% (1/20), respectively. The median deviation from ideal sphericity (1.0) was 0.135 (ECSEC) vs. 0.344 (LF-MWA) vs. 0.314 (HF-MWA) (p < 0.001). The absolute minimal ablative margin was 8.1 vs. 2.3 vs. 3.1 mm (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Microwave ablation of liver malignancies is a safe and efficient treatment independent of the system used. Hepatic MWA with ECSEC achieves significantly more spherical ablation zones and higher minimal ablative margins.

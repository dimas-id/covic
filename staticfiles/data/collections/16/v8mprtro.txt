AIM: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is bound to put tremendous pressure on the existing healthcare system. This aim of this technical note is to help in triaging patients with brain tumours who are sent for radiotherapy during this pandemic and to provide safe and evidence-based care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published data for this review were identified by systematically searching PubMed database from November 2007 onwards with the following Medical Subject Heading (Mesh) terms ‘Brain tumours’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘SARS-nCoV-2’, ‘Radiotherapy’, ‘Guidelines’ ‘hypofractionation’ using Boolean search algorithm. Articles in English language were reviewed. RESULTS: We tried to apply the as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA) principle in triaging and management of patients for radiotherapy. We identified protocols which have hypofractionated regimens (reducing patient visits to hospital, time spent in treatment console) with similar outcomes when compared to conventional fractionated regimens and not overburdening the healthcare facility. We also identified the tumours for which we could safely avoid or delay the initiation of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Treatment decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic rely on the safety first/do no harm principle and evidence-based prioritisation of cases for triage. This article is a tool to aid in triaging and prioritising brain tumour patient management. This is for consideration during the pandemic only and certainly not as a strategy for permanent practice change.

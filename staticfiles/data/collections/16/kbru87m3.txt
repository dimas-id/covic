Migration is an event observed in several animals, such as shorebirds moving between the northern and southern hemispheres, during breeding and wintering intervals. Morphophysiological adaptations are necessary to allow the maintenance of migratory cycles and, therefore, studies with this focus can help clarify biological aspects related to migration. We analyzed the morphology variation in pectoral muscles and intestinal mucosa of Calidris pusilla, during different phases of the wintering period on the coast of Brazil. Fragments of pectoral muscles and duodenal were collected, fixed and processed for histology according to standard procedure, from specimens captured in a locality on the Brazilian coast. Modifications were found in the measured parameters among the three phases of wintering, arrival in Brazil (October, mid-period), January and departure to the Northern Hemisphere - May. The registered structural dynamism characterizes the growth of flight musculature and intestinal changes related to nutrition. Such changes occur temporarily due to the activities of preparation and migration between the northern and southern hemispheres.(AU)

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the effects of device-related pressure ulcers (DRPU) into sharp focus. With the increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, continuous positive airway pressure (CAPP) masks and other devices, the incidence of DRPUs among health professionals and patients alike has risen starkly. As such, the Journal of Wound Care (JWC) consensus document, Device-related pressure ulcers: SECURE prevention, published in February 2020, is more relevant than ever. To help support patients and frontline health professionals, JWC is republishing the consensus in a digital format, along with a new introductory article outlining the DRPU risks posed by PPE and other medical devices used by patients and health professionals during the pandemic, and how the skin damage can be avoided. The aim is to provide frontline staff with a clear, simple strategy on how to prevent the risk of personal skin damage and/or DRPU during the pandemic, as well as point them in the direction of more indepth guidance on long-term strategies for prevention, for both themselves and patients.

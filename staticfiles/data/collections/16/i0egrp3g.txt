Activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response is an essential defense mechanism against invading pathogens such as viruses. This chapter describes two protocols to quantify activation of the chicken IFN response through analysis of gene expression by real-time quantitative PCR and by quantification of bioactive IFN protein using a bioassay.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) causes an encephalomyelitis in dogs which varies with the viral strain. The CDV Cornell A75-17 strain produces a delayed, subacute to chronic, demyelinating CNS disease. In contrast, the Snyder Hill (CDV-SH) strain-associated neurological disease is more acute in onset, is usually non-demyelinating and primarily produces lesions in the gray matter. In these studies we describe the effects of these two virulent and one avirulent CDV strain, Rockborn (CDV-RO), on astrocytes in dissociated canine brain cell cultures. In multiple replicate experiments, astrocytes were infected most rapidly by CDV-RO [100% of astrocytes were infected by 14 days post-inoculation (pi.)]. This strain caused severe cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytolysis. CDV-SH similarly produced a rapid infection of the astrocytes. In contrast, CDV A75-17 infected less than 25% of the astrocyte population during the first 28 days p.i. (Â± 7 days); after 28 days p.i., a rapid rise in astrocyte infection occurred. Both virulent viruses caused astrocytic syncytial formation but did not cause cytolysis of the astrocyte population as was observed with the attenuated virus. Titers of infectious virus, released into the supernatant fluid, reflected the degree of astrocyte infection. Virus released by the cultures late in CDV A75-17 infection showed enhanced ability to infect newly derived astrocytes; in contrast, brain cell passaged CDV-SH did not show increased growth in these cells. These results show that (1) there is a difference in growth rate, CPE and capacity for adaptation of three different CDV strains in astrocytes in vitro, and (2) some aspects of the disease (such as persistence in white matter) produced by the virulent strains in vivo may be related to the course of astrocyte infection observed in vitro.

Abstract The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the little evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and the potential interventions to tackle them. Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, what could be due to a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists, from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation of their countries, existing myths and misinformation, and the possible resources available. They were also asked to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CFâ€™s were prepared based on the extant literature and the views expressed; they illustrate the epidemiology of MH issues, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans/innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and probable outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research in pandemic. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts and to develop evidence based MH interventions. However further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.

Hyper-reactivity to non-specific challenges has been considered a hallmark of asthma and is defined as an abnormal responsiveness of the bronchial airways to a variety of provocative agents. The mechanisms underlying hyper-reactivity in the upper and lower airways are not known. By using the nose to study the inflammatory response possible abnormalities can be investigated carefully and pathophysiology of specific airway hyper-reactivities can be better understood. Other factors than merely constriction of the bronchial smooth muscles can cause narrowing of the free lumen to airflow. Functionally different and very distinct mucosal end-organ reactivities may also be increased. If these reactivities can be well assessed, specific airway hyper-reactivity can be defined. In the present report, specific mucosal end-organ hyper-reactivites in the allergic nasal mucosa are presented. Certain widespread hypotheses, such as the role of the eosinophil and the “increased absorption permeability theory”, are disputed.

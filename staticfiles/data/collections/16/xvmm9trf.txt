Since the end of 2019 an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, called 2019--nCoV, is reported from China and later other parts of the world. Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both China and other countries. In this work we present some discrete and continuous models to discribe the disease dynamics in China and estimate the needed epidemiological parameters. Good agreement with the current dynamics has be found for both a discrete transmission model and a slightly modified SIR-model.

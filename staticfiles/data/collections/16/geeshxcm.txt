The portal vein carries blood from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver and in so doing carries microbes as well. The liver may therefore be involved in infections with a myriad number of microbial organisms. While some of these infections most commonly occur in the immunocompromised host, others affect the immune competence. Hepatic infections may be primary in nature or secondary, as part of systemic or contagious disease. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief overview of the various infections of the liver in the pediatric patient.

This review will focus on the therapeutic uses of antioxidant liposomes. Antioxidant liposomes have a unique ability to deliver both lipid- and water-soluble antioxidants to tissues. This review will detail the varieties of antioxidants which have been incorporated into liposomes, their modes of administration, and the clinical conditions in which antioxidant liposomes could play an important therapeutic role. Antioxidant liposomes should be particularly useful for treating diseases or conditions in which oxidative stress plays a significant pathophysiological role because this technology has been shown to suppress oxidative stress. These diseases and conditions include cancer, trauma, irradiation, retinotherapy or prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, chemical weapon exposure, and pulmonary infections.

SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread rapidly outside of mainland China. As of April 6, there are over 300,000 cases and 10,000 deaths in the US. Effective therapies for the novel Coronavirus are urgently needed and over 200 clinical trials are now underway across the globe. Recognizing the need for robust randomized control trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently organized a multinational randomized trial-the SOLIDARITY trial-to study the effect of drugs that have been identified as promising based on in-vitro data and the early clinical experience with COVID-19: Remdesivir, lopinavir and ritonavir; lopinavir and ritonavir + interferon; and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.

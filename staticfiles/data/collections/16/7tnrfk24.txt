Abstract The pandemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to a process of adaptation to the new situation by society as a whole and, therefore, by assisted reproduction centres. After the acute phase of the health crisis, when activity was drastically reduced, cycles have resumed, guided by the recommendations of scientific societies. In this article, a review is presented of all the published information regarding the virus and the reproductive system, pointing out the presence of ACE2 in the female and male reproductive system, at the testicular, ovarian, endometrial and embryonic levels. In addition, a comparative analysis is carried out between the recommendations of the scientific societies regarding the screening of infection, performance standards, and general laboratory measurements.

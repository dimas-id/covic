CHOReVOLUTION is a platform for the tool-assisted development and execution of scalable applications that leverage the distributed collaboration of services specified through service choreographies. It offers an Integrated Development and Runtime Environment (IDRE) comprising a wizard-aided development environment, a system monitoring console, and a back-end for managing the deployment and execution of the system on the cloud. In this tutorial paper, we describe the platform and demonstrate its step-by-step application to an industrial use case in the domain of Smart Mobility & Tourism.

BACKGROUND Weight loss following bariatric surgery varies according to patient factors before the intervention. However, whether predictors of weight loss differ between men and women is, to our knowledge, unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate baseline predictors for overall weight loss and identify potential sex-specific baseline predictors in bariatric surgery patients. METHODS In this prospective cohort study, 160 patients (117 women and 43 men) who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were followed up for 2 years. Weight loss was defined as percent excess body mass index loss (%EBMIL). To investigate whether %EBMIL differed between men and women, we included all two-way interactions with sex by incorporating the product term sex and predictors using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS The overall mean ± standard deviation of %EBMIL after 2 years was 78.3 ± 23.5. Predictors for lower %EBMIL in a regression model with no interactions were female sex (P = 0.003), higher body mass index before surgery (P = 0.001), and nonsmoking (P = 0.029). When examining sex-specific predictors for %EBMIL, higher age (P = 0.027) and not having diabetes (P = 0.007) predicted lower %EBMIL in men. In women, unemployment (P = 0.006) and anxiety and/or depression (P = 0.009) predicted lower %EBMIL. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that weight loss and predictors for weight loss 2 years after sleeve gastrectomy are sex-specific. These findings may be useful for the surgical strategy used to treat these patients.

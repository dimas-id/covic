BACKGROUND The McGRATH MAC Video laryngoscope (Covidien Japan) is a relatively new device for tracheal intubation, which provides an excellent glottis view. We here report the clinical experience of the McGRATH in 100 patients who received general anesthesia. METHODS Tracheal intubation with the McGRATH was performed in 100 patients requiring oro/naso tracheal intubation. The view of glottic opening was scored according to the classification of Cormack-Lehane. The time required to intubate and the number of intubation attempts were recorded. RESULTS Cormack-Lehane classification 1 or 2 was obtained in 99 of 100 patients, respectively, and successful intubation was achieved in all patients. The mean +/- SD time to successful intubation was 40 +/- 19 seconds. CONCLUSIONS The McGRATH was easily handled not only by experienced anesthetists but also by novice personnel. The McGRATH seems to be a useful device in routine and difficult airway management.

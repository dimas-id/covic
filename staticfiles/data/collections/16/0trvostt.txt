Abstract The 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak constitutes an example of the many crises that a restaurant may encounter. This article reviews a typology of crises, examines the crisis response of restaurants in Hong Kong, illustrates how local restaurants deal with this unprecedented situation and develop strategies for management and recovery. The lessons and experience gained from dealing with the SARS crisis serve as references for restaurants in other destinations when they face similar crises in future.

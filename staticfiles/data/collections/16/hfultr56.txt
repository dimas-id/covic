BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular coiling of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms is associated with low rates of initial angiographic occlusion and high rates of recurrence. The WEB intrasaccular device has been developed specifically for this indication. To date, there has been no report of the long-term follow-up of a series of patients with aneurysms treated with this type of device, to our knowledge. Our aim was to evaluate a 1-year follow-up of angiographic results in a prospective single-center series of patients treated with the WEB-Single-Layer (SL) device. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients treated with the WEB-SL device in our center between August 2013 and May 2014 were prospectively included. One-year angiographic outcomes were assessed. Results at follow-up were graded as complete occlusion, neck remnant, or residual aneurysm. RESULTS Eight patients with 8 unruptured wide-neck aneurysms were enrolled in this study. Average dome width was 7.5 mm (range, 5.4-10.7 mm), and average neck size was 4.9 mm (range, 2.6-6.5 mm). One-year angiographic follow-up obtained in all aneurysms included 1 complete aneurysm occlusion (12.5%), 6 neck remnants (75%), and 1 aneurysm remnant (12.5%). Of 8 aneurysms, worsening of aneurysm occlusion was observed in 2 (25%) by compression of the WEB device. There was no angiographic recurrence of initially totally occluded aneurysms. No bleeding was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular therapy of intracranial aneurysms with the WEB-SL device allows treatment of wide-neck aneurysms with a high rate of neck remnant at 1 year, at least partially explained by WEB compression. Initial size selection and technologic improvements could be an option for optimization of aneurysm occlusion in WEB-SL treatment.

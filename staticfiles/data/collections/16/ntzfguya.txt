Eleven asymptomatic carriers who received nasal or throat swab test for SARS-CoV-2 after close contacts with patients who developed symptomatic 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were enrolled in this study. The chest CT images of enrolled patients were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. There were 3 (27.3%) patients had normal first chest CT, two of which were under age of 15 years. Lesions in 2 (18.2%) patients involved one lobe with unifocal presence. Subpleural lesions were seen in 7 (63.6%) patients. Ground glass opacity (GGO) was the most common sign observed in 7 (63.6%) patients. Crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were detected in 2 (18.2%) and 4 (36.4%) cases, respectively. Based on deep learning quantitative analysis, volume of intrapulmonary lesions on first CT scans was 85.73±84.46 cm3. In patients with positive findings on CT images, average interval days between positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay and peak volume on CT images were 5.1±3.1 days. In conclusion, typical CT findings can be detected in over 70% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. It mainly starts as GGO along subpleural regions and bronchi, and absorbs in nearly 5 days.

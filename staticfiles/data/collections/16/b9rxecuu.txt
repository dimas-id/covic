Many infectious diseases have the potential to complicate pregnancy. Some illnesses may only impact maternal health, but others can infect the fetus with possible devastating or long-term sequelae. In this chapter we aim to review common infectious diseases such as urinary tract infections and influenza as well as those that can cause major neonatal morbidity and mortality including TORCH infections. We will also discuss the challenges that pregnancy creates for the management of these infectious diseases as some antibiotics that would typically be used may not be safe for the developing fetus depending on the stage of pregnancy.

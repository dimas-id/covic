Although major advances in the care of cancer patients over the past several decades have resulted in improved survival, infectious complications remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. To successfully identify, treat, and prevent infections, a comprehensive understanding of risk factors that predispose to infection and of commonly encountered pathogens is necessary. In addition, clinicians must keep abreast of the changing epidemiology of infections in this population. As therapeutic modalities continue to evolve, as established pathogens become increasingly drug resistant, and as new pathogens are discovered, successful management of infections will continue to present challenges in the years to come.

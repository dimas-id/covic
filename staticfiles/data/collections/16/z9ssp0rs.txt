Abstract Understanding of droplet transport in indoor environments with thermal effects is very important to comprehend the airborne pathogen infection through expiratory droplets. In this work, a well-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES) was performed to compute the concentration profiles of monodisperse aerosols in non-isothermal low-Reynolds turbulent flow taking place in an enclosed environment. Good care was taken to ensure that the main dynamical features of the continuous phase were captured by the present LES. The particle phase was studied in both Lagrangian and Eulerian frameworks. Steady temperature and velocity were measured prior to droplet emission. Evolution of aerosol concentration was measured by a particle counter. Results of the present LES were to compare reasonably well with the experimental findings for both phases.

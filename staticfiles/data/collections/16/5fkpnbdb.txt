BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether MS disease modifying therapies impact ability to mount an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Case series and literature review. We report a series of two MS patients who developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy and subsequently exhibited negative SARS-CoV-2 serology. RESULTS: A 42-year-old man and 39-year-old woman with MS developed COVID-19 while on Ocrelizumab therapy. Neither patient required hospitalization. The man exhibited negative serology at 7- and 9-weeks post-infection. The woman exhibited negative serology at 6- and 12-weeks post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Large studies are essential to determine whether certain DMTs may blunt SARS-CoV-2 antibody production.

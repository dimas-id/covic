The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Healthcare providers should prepare internal guidelines covering all aspect of the organization in order to have their unit ready as soon as possible. This document addresses the current COVID-19 pandemic for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) practitioners. The goals the guidelines put forth here are two fold- first to reduce patient risk through healthcare exposure, understanding that asymptomatic health systems/healthcare providers may become the most common vector for transmission, and second to reduce the public health burden of COVID-19 transmission throughout the general population. Box 1 outlines general guidance to prevent spread of COVID-19 and protect our obstetric patients. Section 1 outlines suggested modifications of outpatient obstetrical (prenatal) visits. Section 2 details suggested scheduling of obstetrical ultrasound. Section 3 reviews suggested modification of nonstress tests (NST) and biophysical profiles (BPP). Section 4 reviews suggested visitor policy for obstetric outpatient office. Section 5 discusses the role of trainees and medical education in the setting of a pandemic. These are suggestions, which can be adapted to local needs and capabilities. Guidance is changing rapidly, so please continue to watch for updates.

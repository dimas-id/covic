We read with great interest the study by YF Zhang et al ([1]). The authors found that abnormalities of liver function tests are common in COVID‐19 patients, but the clinically significant liver dysfunction in COVID‐19 was not a prominent feature of this illness and also may not have serious clinical consequences. This study is important and interesting; however, we still have some concerns about it.

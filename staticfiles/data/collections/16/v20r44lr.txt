The development of diagnostics and medical devices has historically been concentrated in high-income countries, despite a significant need to expand healthcare services to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Poor quality healthcare extends beyond LMIC to underserved communities in developed countries. This paper reviews diseases and conditions that have not received much attention in the past despite imposing a significant burden on healthcare systems in these circumstances. We review the underlying mechanism of action of these conditions and current technology in use for diagnosis or surgical intervention. We aim to identify areas for technological development and review policy considerations that will enable real-world adoption. Specifically, this review focuses on diseases prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia: melioidosis, infant and maternal mortality, schistosomiasis, and heavy metal and pesticide poisoning. Our aim with this review is to identify problems facing the world that require the attention of the medical device community and provide recommendations for research directions for groups interested in this field.

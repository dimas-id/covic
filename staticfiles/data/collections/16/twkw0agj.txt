The diversity of infectious disease threats currently facing humanity is unprecedented because of the remarkable emergence and reemergence of pathogens worldwide. Because of population mobility, globalization of commerce and the food supply, and the effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, infections in the developing world must be addressed to prevent infections in industrialized countries. Because pathogens do not recognize national boundaries, the rapidity with which individuals can circumnavigate the globe incubating infections makes the control of communicable diseases an enormous challenge for governments as well as for the public and primary health care systems. A global strategy for dealing with infectious disease threats must be developed and implemented as soon as possible.

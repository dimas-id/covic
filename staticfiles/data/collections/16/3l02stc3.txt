Objective: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented threat to public health. Current measures to control the spread include social distancing and quarantine, which may trigger mental health problems.Design and Main Outcome Measures: The sample (N = 1160) constituted three groups: people quarantined in an affected area, unaffected areas, and people not in quarantine. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-20) and the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) were administered as measures of depression and anxiety, respectively. The multi-variant logistic and multiple linear regression identified factors associated with depression and anxiety.Results: Probable depression and anxiety were reported by 26.47% and 70.78% of all respondents, respectively. After adjusting for demographic and community variables, quarantined respondents reported a higher likelihood to exhibit symptoms of depression and anxiety than those not quarantined. Respondents living in communities where screening for COVID-19 was required were less likely to report depression and anxiety symptoms.Conclusion: The incidence of depression and anxiety among quarantined respondents was significantly higher than that of respondents not quarantined, and twice as common among quarantined respondents in unaffected areas as those in affected areas. Appropriate community screening may reduce the risk of depression and anxiety during an epidemic.

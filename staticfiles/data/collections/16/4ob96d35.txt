The recent outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel coronavirus, has now spread quickly worldwide. Like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), this novel type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been demonstrated to utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry point to the cells. There is a growing body of reports indicating that COVID-19 patients, especially those in severe condition, exhibit neurological symptoms, thus supporting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could infect and damage neurons within the central nervous system in humans. Using human pluripotent stem cells-derived neurons, here we show the expression of ACE2 in human neurons via immunocytochemistry. From this perspective, we elaborate on the idea that the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered as a possible contributory factor, as well as a therapeutic target, for the severe respiratory symptoms in critical COVID-19 cases.

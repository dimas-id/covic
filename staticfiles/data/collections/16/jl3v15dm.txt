BACKGROUND Clinical trials confirmed the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial therapy (IAT) in the management of ischemic stroke. At a community hospital, we compared outcomes in patients aged ≥80 and patients in the age range 55-79 years receiving IAT following ischemic stroke. METHODS Data were retrospectively abstracted for ischemic stroke patients ≥55 years treated with IAT at an urban comprehensive stroke center between 2010 and 2013. Baseline demographics, incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), in-hospital mortality, discharge modified Rankin scale (mRS) score (favorable ≤2) and improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS; decreased score at discharge) were compared between patients in the age range 55-79 and patients ≥80 years. Data were analyzed using univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS IAT was performed in 239 patients with ischemic stroke; 63 (26.4%) were ≥80 years. When compared to patients aged 55-79, the elderly patients were more often female and non-smokers, with a history of atrial fibrillation. No differences were observed in those ≥80 years compared to patients in the age range 55-79 years for sICH (10 vs. 5%, p = 0.23), mortality (24 vs. 18%, p = 0.28), favorable discharge mRS score (13 vs. 19%, p = 0.27), or improvement in NIHSS (83 vs. 92%, p = 0.10). The nonsignificant association of age with the outcomes persisted after adjusting for covariates and when analyzing the subset of patients who received IAT only. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that in a cohort not subject to the criteria of a clinical trial, age ≥80 years should not be a contraindication to IAT.

PURPOSE Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) uses single incisions for the introduction of instruments through a specially designed multi-lumen single port (multi-port) for the performance of several urologic procedures. METHODS Literature review regarding the LESS approach took place on May 2009 and the experiences of our institutions were also included. RESULTS Almost all urologic intra-abdominal and pelvic procedures have been successfully and safely performed with the LESS approach. Nevertheless, current experience is limited and there are significant technical challenges to the performance of LESS techniques. CONCLUSIONS Wider adaptation of the approach requires refinement of LESS instrumentation to overcome the technical challenges of the approach. The improved outcome should also be documented with further clinical evaluation.

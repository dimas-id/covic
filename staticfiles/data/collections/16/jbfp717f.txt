We propose a general algorithm that treats cascade training as a tree search process working according to the branch-and-bound technique. The algorithm allows to reduce the expected number of features used by an operating cascadeâ€”a key quantity we focus on in the paper. While searching, we observe suitable lower bounds on partial expectations and prune tree branches that cannot improve the best-so-far result. Both exact and approximate variants of the approach are formulated. Experiments pertain to cascades trained to be face or letter detectors with Haar-like features or Zernike moments being the input information, respectively. Results confirm shorter operating times of cascades obtained owing to the reduction in the number of extracted features.

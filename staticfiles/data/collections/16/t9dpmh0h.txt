The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been recently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In addition to its acute respiratory manifestations, SARS-CoV-2 may also adversely affect other organ systems. To date, however, there is very limited understanding of the extent and management of COVID-19-related conditions outside of the pulmonary system. This narrative review provides an overview of the current literature about the extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 that may affect the urinary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, hematopoietic, neurological, or reproductive systems. This review also describes current understanding of the extra-pulmonary complications caused by COVID-19 in order to improve the management and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

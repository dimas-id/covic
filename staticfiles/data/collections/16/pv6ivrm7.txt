A 65-year-old woman was referred with hypercalcaemia and found to have a four cm retrotracheal mass on CT. The patient also suffered from neurofibromatosis and a recently diagnosed gastric mass. Tc(99) sestamibi scintigraphy revealed an area of intense uptake in the right upper mediastinum. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) was used to confirm the diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma and thoracoscopic resection was subsequently performed. EBUS-TBNA biopsy can be a helpful diagnostic tool to confirm diagnosis of mediastinal parathyroid masses in patients with atypical or complex clinical presentations.

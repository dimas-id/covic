OBJECTIVE To evaluate an antibacterial dressing for the management of lower-extremity chronic wounds with critical colonization. DESIGN A case series of n = 15 patients with lower-extremity chronic wounds were treated with an antibacterial foam dressing consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam bound with gentian violet and methylene blue (Hydrofera Blue; Hydrofera, LLC, Willimantic, Connecticut). SETTING An outpatient clinic in Ontario, Canada. PATIENTS The dressing was applied to diabetic foot ulcers (n = 8) and other venous/leg wound etiologies (n = 7). The study population was clinically challenging due to high mean body weight, extended wound durations, and high diabetes prevalence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Wounds were assessed for clinical signs of superficial and deep/surrounding bacterial burden using the validated NERDS and STONEES mnemonic and with semiquantitative bacterial swabs. Changes in wound size, pain, and other clinical parameters were also recorded. MAIN RESULTS Improvements in surface critical colonization and pain score at the end of the study period were noted in some patients, especially in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. A decreasing wound size was observed in 8 of the 14 patients (57%) at week 4. One patient was excluded from wound size change analysis. CONCLUSIONS An antibacterial foam dressing consisting of PVA foam bound with gentian violet and methylene blue showed encouraging results in a clinically challenging study population. This dressing may be a suitable option for lower-extremity chronic wounds demonstrating an increased superficial bacterial burden. Further investigation focused on identifying the characteristics of patients who are most responsive to the dressing is warranted.

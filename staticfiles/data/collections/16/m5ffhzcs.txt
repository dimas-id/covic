Introduction Pneumococcal colonisation is regarded as a pre-requisite for developing pneumococcal disease. In children previous studies have reported colonisation to be a symptomatic event and described a relationship between symptom severity/frequency and colonisation density. The evidence for this in adults is lacking in the literature. This study uses an experimental human pneumococcal challenge model to explore whether pneumococcal colonisation (or co-colonisation with a respiratory virus) is a symptomatic event in healthy adults. Methods Healthy volunteers aged 18-50 were recruited and inoculated intra-nasally with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (serotypes 6B, 23F) or saline as a control. Respiratory viral swabs were obtained prior to inoculation. Nasal and non-nasal symptoms were then assessed using a modified Likert score between 1 (no symptoms) to 7 (cannot function). The rate of symptoms reported between groups was compared and a correlation analysis performed. Results Data from 54 participants were analysed. 46 were inoculated with S. pneumoniae (29 with 6B, 17 with 23F) and 8 received saline. In total, 14 became experimentally colonised (30.4%), all of which were inoculated with 6B serotype. There was no statistically significant difference in nasal (p= 0.45) or non-nasal symptoms (p=0.28) between the pneumococcal inoculation group and the saline group. There was no direct correlation between colonisation density and symptom severity in those who were colonised. In the 22% (12/52) who were co-colonised with pneumococcus and respiratory viruses there was no statistical difference in either nasal or non-nasal symptoms (virus positive p=0.74 and virus negative p=1.0). Conclusion Pneumococcal colonisation is asymptomatic in healthy adults, regardless of bacterial density or viral co-colonisation.

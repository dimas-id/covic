The diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia is usually based on clinical and radiological criteria. The identification of a causative organism is not required for the diagnosis. Although numerous microbiological techniques are available, their sensitivity and specificity are not high enough to guide first-line antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, this treatment remains most often empiric. If the causative organism is identified, the antimicrobial treatment is adapted. Sputum analysis may be proposed as a diagnostic tool for patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in specific cases (prior antibiotherapy, hospitalization, failure of the empiric antimicrobial treatment).

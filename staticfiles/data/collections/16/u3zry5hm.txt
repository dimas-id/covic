BACKGROUND Disappointing long-term results, frequent band failure, and high rates of band-related complications increasingly necessitate revisional surgery after adjustable gastric banding. Laparoscopic conversion to gastric bypass has been recommended as the procedure of choice. This single-center retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of revisional gastric bypass after failed adjustable gastric banding. METHODS The study included 108 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic conversion of gastric banding to gastric bypass from 2002 to 2012. Indications for surgery, operative data, weight development, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 3.4 years (maximum, 10 years). RESULTS The most common indications for band removal were band migration, insufficient weight loss, and pouch dilation. The median interval between gastric banding and gastric bypass was 6.6 years. In 52 % of the cases, band removal and gastric bypass surgery were performed simultaneously as a single-stage laparoscopic procedure. The early postoperative morbidity rate was 10.2 %. The body mass index before gastric banding (43.3 kg/m(2)) decreased significantly to 37.9 kg/m(2) before gastric bypass and to 28.8 kg/m(2) 5 years after gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on the long-term outcome after conversion of failed adjustable gastric banding to gastric bypass. Findings have shown revisional gastric bypass to be a feasible bariatric procedure particularly for patients with insufficient weight loss that guarantees a constant and long-lasting weight loss.

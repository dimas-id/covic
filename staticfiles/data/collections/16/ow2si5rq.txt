Three new dihydrophenanthrenes, 4-methoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-1,2,7-triol (1), 1-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-4,7-dimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-2-ol (2), and 1,3,6-tri(4-hydroxybenzyl)-4-methoxydihydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol (3) together with seven known phenanthrene derivatives, six known flavonoids, a bibenzyl and three phenolic compounds were isolated from the whole plant of Bletilla formosana. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic, mainly 2D NMR spectrometry and chemical methods.

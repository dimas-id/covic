PURPOSE Esophageal anastomotic leakage is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality after esophagectomy. We conducted this study to elucidate how anastomotic leakage affects the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. METHODS The subjects of this retrospective study were 61 patients who underwent esophagectomy. We evaluated their preoperative status, the surgical procedures, and postoperative systemic response, including white blood cell count, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, and laboratory data up to postoperative day (POD) 4. RESULTS Anastomotic leakage developed in nine patients (14.8%) and was found on POD 7 on average. These patients had a significantly longer hospital stay than those without leakage. Although no difference was observed in postoperative changes of any of the SIRS criteria, the postoperative incidence of SIRS was significantly higher in the patients with anastomotic leakage on POD 4. The number of positive criteria for SIRS was also significantly higher in patients with anastomotic leakage than in those without leakage on PODs 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS The SIRS scoring system is valuable for evaluating the severity of systemic inflammatory response caused by anastomosis leakage, and may serve as an indicator for prompt management.

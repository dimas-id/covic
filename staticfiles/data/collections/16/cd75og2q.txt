We investigated human calicivirus (HCV)-associated diarrheain children attending day care centers by using stool specimens collected in 1981â€“1983. We used a screening enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) derived from reagents prepared against the Sapporostrain ofHCV and confirmed positive results with a blocking ELISA an dimmunosorbent electron microscopy. HCV was detected in 11 (2.9%) of 375 diarrheal stools and in none of 86 stools from asymptomatic contacts. This incidence ratewas half that noted for rotaviruses and higher than that noted for Campylobaeter, Salmonella, and Shigella in the original study. HCV was found in stool specimens from children in nine day care centers; HCV-associated diarrhea was sporadic, occurred with greater frequency in young children, and had a summer-fall predominance. Our results indicate that HeV is an important cause of diarrheain day care centers and that frozen stool samples can yield epidemiological data on HCV infection.

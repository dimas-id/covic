INTRODUCTION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is increasingly applied for cholecystectomy and has been reported as safe and feasible, with short-term operative outcomes equivalent to four-port cholecystectomy. Although many investigators in randomized studies have noted the cosmetic advantages of SILC, the benefit of decreased pain in SILC remains controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the efficacy of the rectus sheath block in SILC with respect to subjective pain. METHODS From April 2010 to March 2012, 75 patients with symptomatic gallstone or gallbladder polyps were assigned to one of three groups: (i) four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 29); (ii) SILC (n = 15); and (iii) rectus sheath block in SILC (n = 30). We evaluated the operative details, length of hospital stay, and the need and usage of analgesia. Postoperative pain was recorded at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery based on a visual analog scale. RESULTS There was no difference with regard to age, ASA score, BMI, duration of operation, or length of hospital stay among the three groups. A significantly lower pain score was observed in the rectus sheath block in SILC group than in the SILC group at 2 and 6 h after operation. The pain score and need for analgesia were similar between the SILC group and the four-port cholecystectomy group. CONCLUSION SILC using an ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block significantly reduces postoperative pain.

Two intestinal spirochete isolates obtained from chickens with diarrhea were examined by electron microscopy, biochemical tests, rRNA gene restriction pattern analysis, and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. One isolate (strain 91-1207/C1) was pathogenicity tested in vivo in chickens. The chicken spirochetes were morphologically indistinguishable from Serpulina innocens and Serpulina hyodysenteriae and phenotypically similar to S. innocens. However, the chicken spirochetes could be distinguished from S. innocens, S. hyodysenteriae, and other swine intestinal spirochetes by rRNA gene restriction pattern analysis and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. In pathogenicity tests in 1-day-old chicks and 14-month-old hens, chicken spirochete 91-1207/C1 produced pale-yellow, watery cecal contents and mild lymphocytic typhlitis. These findings support the conclusion that avian intestinal spirochetes can be pathogenic to commercial poultry and that the microorganisms are different from intestinal spirochetes that infect pigs.

Abstract It was widely believed in the late 1960s that infectious diseases had been conquered by vaccines and antibiotics and humans were no longer under threat by microbial pathogens. Yet, since that time more than 60 pathogens have been discovered that can cause serious emerging infectious diseases. Molecular methods have played critical roles in the discovery, monitoring, and clinical diagnostics of emerging pathogens. In this chapter, we present well-recognized emerging pathogens. We provide examples of the utility of molecular assays in research and clinical care of emerging infectious diseases. We also discuss some theoretical and practical limitations of molecular tests and the future prospects of expanding molecular diagnostics for emerging pathogens based on new advances of knowledge and technologies.

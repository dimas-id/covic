Abstract This article addresses issues that are central to the dual use of biotechnology, such as the public perception of risk and the need for physical containment to prevent the release of potentially dangerous microorganisms. It also examines the public and media perception of the scientists who handle and manipulate these pathogens and discusses the controls that are currently in place to ensure that scientists engaged in defense-related dual-use medical research act in a transparent and ethical manner. Finally, the article discusses what can be done by scientists to allay the fears of their fellow citizens.

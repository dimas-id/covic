SARS-CoV-2 causes ongoing infections worldwide, and identifying people with immunity is becoming increasingly important. Available point-of-care diagnostic systems as lateral flow assays have high potential for fast and easy on-site antibody testing but are lacking specificity, sensitivity or possibility for quantitative measurements. Here, a new point-of-care approach for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection in human serum based on magnetic immuno-detection is described and compared to standard ELISA. For magnetic immuno-detection, immunofiltration columns were coated with a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide. SARS-CoV-2 peptide reactive antibodies, spiked at different concentrations into PBS and human serum, were rinsed through immunofiltration columns. Specific antibodies were retained within the IFC and labelled with an isotype specific biotinylated antibody. Streptavidin-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were applied to label the secondary antibodies. Enriched magnetic nanoparticles were then detected by means of frequency magnetic mixing detection technology, using a portable magnetic read-out device. Measuring signals corresponded to the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the sample. Our preliminary magnetic immuno-detection setup resulted in a higher sensitivity and broader detection range and was four times faster than ELISA. Further optimizations could reduce assay times to that of a typical lateral flow assay, enabling a fast and easy approach, well suited for point-of-care measurements without expensive lab equipment.

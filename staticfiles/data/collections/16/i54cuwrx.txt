PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights clinically relevant updates to common and significant bacterial, viral, and fungal cutaneous infection within the past 5 years. Recent developments are presented so that the clinician may provide evidence-based, high-quality patient care. RECENT FINDINGS: New resistance patterns in cutaneous pathogens have recently emerged as a result of inappropriate antimicrobial use. Several new FDA-approved antimicrobials have been approved to treat such infections, including multi-drug resistant pathogens. Several organizational guidelines for cutaneous infection management have been updated with new recommendations for screening, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. SUMMARY: Clinicians should be aware of the most recent evidence and guidelines for the management of cutaneous infections in order to reduce the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and most effectively treat their patients.

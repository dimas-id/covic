Cu(I)Cl promoted synthesis of N-propargylated-isatin Mannich mono- and bis-adducts with an extension towards the synthesis of N-propargylated-isatin-7-chloroquinoline conjugates was described. The synthesized scaffolds were evaluated for their in vitro activity against the veterinary protozoal pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus and cytotoxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell line. The preliminary evaluation data revealed the enhancement in the activity profiles with the introduction of 7-chloroquinoline ring with the most active conjugates 7a, 7c and 7d exhibiting an IC(50) of 22.2, 11.3 and 24.5 Î¼M respectively against T. foetus and minimal toxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cell lines.

There are several methods to achieve the therapeutic sacrifice of the vessel, coiling brings the most commonly used. Penumbra occlusion device (POD) system is a newer modality for therapeutic large vessel occlusion, and it is the Food and Drug Administration approved only for peripheral vessels. We report a case where therapeutic vertebral artery (VA) occlusion was achieved with the POD system and Ruby coils for the first time. A patient was diagnosed with a new malignant-appearing tumor of the cervical spine. A conventional angiogram showed multiple tiny arterial feeders from the VA beyond scope of coil/onyx embolization, so we performed a balloon occlusion test followed by therapeutic sacrifice of the VA. A successful VA occlusion was achieved with significant reduction in the tumor blush, followed by open resection of the tumor. The patient had favorable postoperative course and without any neurological symptoms attributed to the VA occlusion.

BACKGROUND The amount of published experience using natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is increasing. However, approximately half of the technical approaches described include NOTES as part of a hybrid procedure. Colonic resections performed using NOTES have mainly been described using a hybrid approach. METHODS An 84-year-old female presented with a symptomatic volvulus of the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic detorsion and desufflation were successfully performed. Definitive treatment was accomplished by performing a sigmoid resection entirely via a transvaginal route using a single port device (SILSâ„¢ Covidien, Westbury, MA, USA). RESULTS Operative time was 135 min. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. Only minimal narcotic analgesia was required and oral intake was initiated on postoperative day 3. At the last follow-up assessment, 2 months postoperatively, no complications or recurrent volvulus were observed. CONCLUSION Transvaginal NOTES sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid volvulus is feasible and can be performed safely.

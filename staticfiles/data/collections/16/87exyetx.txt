BACKGROUND Limited (wedge) resection of pulmonary lesions is frequently performed as a diagnostic/therapeutic procedure. Some lesions may be difficult to locate thoracoscopically with conversion to open thoracotomy or incomplete resection being potential limitations to this approach. Multiple methods have been described to aid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) wedge resection of pulmonary nodules, including hookwire localization, percutaneous tattoo, or intraoperative ultrasound. We report on our experience using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic dye marking of small subpleural lesions to aid VATS wedge resection. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing VATS wedge resection of peripheral lesions. Preoperative bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation was utilized to guide a 25 G needle to within/adjacent to the target lesion with injection of 1 mL of methylene blue or indigo carmine under fluoroscopic vision. RESULTS Six patients underwent bronchoscopic marking of peripheral pulmonary lesions, navigation deemed successful in all patients, with no procedural complications. Surgery was performed within 24 hours of bronchoscopic marking. Pleural staining by dye was visible thoracoscopically in all 6 lesions either adjacent to or overlying the lesion. All lesions were fully excised with wedge resection. Pathologic examination confirmed accuracy of dye staining. CONCLUSIONS Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic dye marking of peripheral lesions is feasible, without complications commonly associated with percutaneous marking procedures. Further experience is required but early findings suggest that this method may have utility in aiding minimally invasive resection of small subpleural lesions.

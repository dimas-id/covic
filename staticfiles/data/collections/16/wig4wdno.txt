Abstract Ovomucin (OVM) plays an important role in inhibiting infection of various pathogens. However, this bioactivity mechanism is not much known. Here, the role of sialic acid in OVM anti-virus activity has been studied by ELISA with lectin or ligand. Structural changes of OVM after removing sialic acid were analyzed by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. OVM could be binding to the hemagglutinin (HA) of avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1, this binding was specific and required the involvement of sialic acid. When sialic acid was removed, the binding was significantly reduced 71.5% and 64.35%, respectively. Therefore, sialic acid was proved as a recognition site which avian influenza virus bound to. Meanwhile, the endogenous fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity of OVM removing sialic acid were increased and the secondary structure tended to shift to random coil. This indicated that OVM molecules were in an unfolded state and spatial conformation disorder raising weakly. Remarkably, free sialic acid strongly promoted OVM binding to HA and thereby enhanced the interaction. It may contribute to the inhibition of host cell infection, agglutinate viruses. This study can be extended to the deepening of passive immunization field.

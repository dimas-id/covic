In a short span, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become the world pandemic by rapidly spreading almost to all the countries around the globe, irrespective of the continent, population size, economic status and healthcare system. Despite the number of cases increasing exponentially in most of the countries, there exist certain disparities in terms of case-fatality rates. As of April 24, 2020, the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 is about 7.0%, with 193,671 deaths and 2,761,121 confirmed cases around the world. Although the United States of America (USA), Spain, Italy, France, and Germany are the top-most affected counties in terms of confirmed cases; France, Italy and Spain are leading the list in terms of case-fatality rates. Therefore, through this mini-review, authors sought to brief on possible assumptions (five D's) that might contribute to the varying case-fatality rates among different countries across the globe.

The annotation practice is an almost daily activity; it is used by healthcare professionals (PHC) to analyze, collaborate, share knowledge and communicate, between them, information present in the healthcare record of patients. These annotations are created in a healthcare cycle that consists of: diagnosis, treatment, advice, follow-up and observation. Due to an exponential increase in the number of medical annotation systems that are used by different categories of health professionals, we are faced with a problem of lack of organization of medical annotation systems developed on the basis of formal criteria. As a result, we have a fragmented image of these annotations tools which make the mission of choice of an annotation system by a PHC, in a well-defined context (biology, radiologyâ€¦) and according to their needs to the functionalities offered by these tools, are difficult. In this article we present a classification of thirty annotation tools developed by industry and academia based on 5 generic criteria. We conclude this survey paper with model proposition.

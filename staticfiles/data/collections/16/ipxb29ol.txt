According to A.T. Kearney's Confidence Index, China maintained its position as the most attractive destination of FDI every year between 2004 and 2012 and ranked as the second popular destination of FDI since 2013 (behind the United States). As mentioned in the previous chapter, owing to the supportive policy environment, export-oriented FDI as an important source of private capital has been, to a great extent, contributing to the growth of Chinese manufacturing. A large number of FDI projects built production hubs for export, helping increase employment of migrant workers and poverty reduction in coastal cities in China.

We report here a clinical and molecular study on a case suffer from severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) due to a new type of bunyavirus, named SFTS bunyavirus (SFTSV), in Zhejiang Province China. The key clinical features of this patient include fever, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. We carried out a serological and molecular investigation in the indicated case and on relatives with close contact. The SFTSV infection was confirmed through amplification of viral genetic material using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the patient's serum, but not relatives with close contact. Subsequently direct sequence of PCR product demonstrated a homology of 94-96% in the nucleotide sequence compared to a reference sequence previously reported, in which the majority of patients originated from an epidemic area of Central and Northeast China. Our results suggest that SFTSV can occur in a non-epidemic area due to a similar strain of SFTSV that apparently affect the blood system, implying the importance of dissecting the pathogenesis of SFTS as well as mode of infection.

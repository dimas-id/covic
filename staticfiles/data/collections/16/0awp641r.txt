Abstract The growth of prototype strains of 31 serotypes of ECHO, 3 polio, 6 Coxsackie B, 24 Coxsackie A and enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 were tested in parallel in primary monkey kidney cells (PMK), RD cells and three gut tumour-derived differentiated epithelial cell lines (HRT-18 HT-29 in SKCO-1). All 31 serotypes of ECHO viruses grew in HT-29, 27 and SKCO-1, 5 in HRT-18, 29 in PMK and 29 in RD. There was good growth of poliovirus serotypes in all five cell types. Coxsackie B viruses grew well in all the cell lines except RD. Fifteen of the Coxsackie A viruses grew in SKCO-1, 4 in HT-29, 3 in HRT-18 and 7 in RD. Enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 grew only in RD cells after 3 serial passages. These results showed that 2 of the gut tumour-derived cell lines, HT-29 and SKCO-1 had a markedly wider susceptibility, with comparable or wider sensitivity, for enteroviruses, than PMK and RD. While their use for field isolation from clinical samples is not yet fully established HT-29 and SKCO-1 would appear to be ideal for a variety of laboratory manipulations of the majority of enteroviruses.

Immunization has played a large role in substantially reducing the infected and death tolls from infectious diseases. In the case of emerging diseases, the identity of the pathogen responsible, as well as the time and location for the next outbreak, cannot be accurately predicted using current means. Coupled with disjointed efforts towards the development of vaccines and a lack of funds and desire to advance promising products against known emerging pathogens to clinical trials, there has been a shortage of approved products ready for emergency use. Recent outbreaks have exposed these weaknesses, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was created in 2016 to address these issues. In this commentary, we discuss the establishment of such a global vaccine fund, and provide some additional points to consider for stimulating further discussion on this comprehensive, ambitious initiative.

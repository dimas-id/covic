Due to the profound effect of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on healthcare systems, surgical programs across the country have paused surgical operations and have been utilizing virtual visits to help maintain public safety. For those who treat obesity, the importance of bariatric surgery has never been more clear. Emerging studies continue to identify obesity and several other obesity-related comorbid conditions as major risk factors for a more severe COVID-19 disease course. However, this also suggests that patients seeking bariatric surgery are inherently at risk of suffering severe complications if they were to contract COVID-19 in the perioperative period. The aim of this protocol is to utilize careful analysis of existing risk stratification for bariatric patients, novel COVID-19-related data, and consensus opinion from multiple academic bariatric centers within our organization to help guide the reanimation of our programs when appropriate and to use this template to prospectively study this risk-stratified population in real time. The core principles of this protocol can be applied to any surgical specialty.

Abstract A mass gathering is “any occasion, either organized or spontaneous, that attracts sufficient numbers of people to strain the planning and response resources of the community, city, or nation hosting the event.”2 Often the existing infrastructure (e.g., public health, health care, or emergency services) is inadequate for the disproportionate sudden surge in demand, hence careful planning is required. Although infectious diseases are most feared due to the potential for rapid international spread, noncommunicable diseases, accidents, and stampedes are more frequent. Mass gatherings may lead to three potential infectious disease public health threats: the risk of importation of infectious diseases usually not seen in the country of the gathering; the amplification of transmission during the event; and the international spread of infectious disease through global mobility networks.

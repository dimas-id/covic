Management of a perforated duodenal ulcer is most commonly performed by laparoscopy and consists of suture of the perforation after performing lavage of the peritoneal cavity. In most cases, a flap is created, and an omental flap is usually the preferred choice because of its simplicity and its proximity to the site of duodenal perforation. However, in some cases, the greater omentum cannot be used due to the severity of peritonitis or due to previous surgical removal. We report a laparoscopic technique for surgical repair of a perforated duodenal ulcer using a round ligament flap. The present manuscript and the associated video highlight some important technical aspects to easily perform this procedure.

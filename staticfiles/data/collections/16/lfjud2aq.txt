PURPOSE OF REVIEW: COronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread at unprecedented speed and scale into a global pandemic with cardiovascular risk factors and complications emerging as important disease modifiers. We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.

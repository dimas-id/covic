OBJECTIVE To discuss the clinical manifestations, therapeutic strategy and prognosis of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) older than 60 years. METHODS Elderly patients diagnosed as SARS in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were compared with younger patients. RESULTS Twenty-four elderly patients and 53 younger patients were analysed. Elderly patients had more coexisting conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and renal disease than control group (P < 0.05). Rate of respiratory failure in elderly patients was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). Elderly patients had more respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum, and shortness of breath (P < 0.05). Rate of lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia in elderly patients was higher than that in control group. All patients were given ribavirin and antibiotics. More patients in elderly group were given 3rd generation cephalosporin and imipenem. Mortality rate in elderly group was higher than that in control group (33.3% vs 3.8%, P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that age, respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia were risk factors of death, but logistic analysis did not find any independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS Though the elderly patients have a lower morbidity of SARS, they have more coexisting conditions. The therapy of elderly patients is more difficult than that of control group, and the mortality in elderly patients is high.

Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) incidents have a disproportionate effect on all aspects of efficient management of casualties. The immediate risks to rescue and healthcare staff, along with damage and threats to existing infrastructure, make CBRN incidents an important consideration to plan and train for, even if the likelihood of encountering them is remote. In addition to the generic ‘all hazards’ approach shared with all major incident planning, CBRN incident management has a number of specific treatments and interventions which require early identification of the agent involved, and thus a high degree of specialist knowledge among responders.

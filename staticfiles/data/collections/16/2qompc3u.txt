Abstract Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is an isometric, non-enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus and a well-studied, representative member of the alphavirus-like super-family of human, animal, and plant viruses. BMV has been extensively studied as a model to examine some of the common features shared by all positive-strand RNA viruses. This article provides insights into virion assembly, encapsidation, gene expression, recombination, RNA replication, and virus-host interactions. These studies have not only advanced understanding of BMV, but have also revealed insights and principles extending to many other viruses and to general cellular biology.

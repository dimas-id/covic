Retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas are challenging tumors to remove given their deep location and proximity to critical neurovascular structures. Complete surgical removal offers the best chance of cure and prevention of recurrence. The endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal approach offers direct midline access to the retrochiasmatic space through a transplanum transtuberculum corridor. Excellent visualization of the undersurface of the optic chiasm and hypothalamus can be obtained to facilitate bimanual extracapsular dissection to permit complete removal of these formidable tumors. In this report the authors review the endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal approach, with specific emphasis on technical operative nuances in removing retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas. An illustrative intraoperative video demonstrating the technique is also presented.

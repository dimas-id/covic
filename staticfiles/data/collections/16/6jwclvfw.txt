INTRODUCTION In a single centre evaluation of a novel hernia repair device, 200 consecutive patients underwent 247 laparoscopic (TAPP) groin hernia repairs (47 bilateral) using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Liquiband®Fix8™) for mesh fixation and peritoneal closure over a 2-year period by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon. PATIENTS AND METHODS All groin hernia patients requiring TAPP repair were included in the study: Inguinal 142, Femoral 14, Spigelian 4, and Inguinal disruption 40. A retrospective review of the data was performed. There were 161 males and 39 females, mean age 55 years (range 20-89 years). Mesh fixation was successful in all 247 TAPP repairs, and 90% of patients had a successful peritoneal closure using the device (20 patients required the use of conventional tacks to complete closure). FOLLOW-UP Patients were followed up with an out-patient visit at 6 weeks post-op, followed by a Patient Initiated Follow Up programme, and a final Telephone follow-up. To date all patients have completed 1 year of follow-up, and 70% of patients 2 years of follow-up (median 29 months, range 14 to 40 months). RESULTS There were very few procedure-related adverse events: groin seromas 6 (2.4%), port site bleeding 2 (0.3%), port site hernia 2 (0.3%), and only 1 groin hernia recurrence (0.4%). Prospective surgeon scoring of satisfaction for mesh fixation, peritoneal closure, and device clogging was favourable and increased following the initial learning phase. Changes in the device design during the study period improved the efficacy of the device significantly. CONCLUSION This retrospective study shows that mesh fixation and peritoneal closure using the Liquiband®Fix8™ device is feasible, safe, practical, and is easy to learn.

BACKGROUND AND GOAL OF STUDY Postoperative myocardial infarction is a serious and frequent complication of cardiac surgery. Nonetheless, diagnosis in this context it is occasionally challenging. We sought to evaluate the kinetics and diagnostic accuracy of the new biomarker « heart-type fatty acid-binding protein » (h-FABP) in the early detection of myocardial injury in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, compared with classical biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted on 17 consecutive patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting during a 2 month period. Blood samples were drawn for measurement of myocardial ischemic injury biomarkers (h-FABP, troponin, creatine kinase [CK] and CK-MB), at baseline (T1), immediate post-coronary artery bypass grafting (T2), on ICU admission (T3), and after 4 (T4), 8 (T5), 24 (T6) and 48 h (T7). Perioperative ischemic complications, defined according to electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic criteria, were recorded. RESULTS Earlier biomarkers peak plasma values occurred at T4 with troponin (2.9 ± 5.2 ng/mL), and at T5 with h-FABP (37.9 ± 55.5 ng/mL). Maximum values of CK and CK-MB occurred later, both in T6 (741 ± 779 and 37 ± 51 U/L, respectively). The optimized cut-off obtained for h-FABP was 19 ng/mL, providing a sensitivity and specificity of 77 and 75%, respectively, for diagnosis of perioperative ischemic injury, with an area under the ROC curve for h-FABP of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6-1.0) vs. 0.63 (95% CI 0.33-0.83) for troponin. This cut-off value for h-FABP is reached on average at T2 (mean value of h-FABP at T2: 18.9 ± 21.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSION This is the first study evaluating the kinetics of h-FABP biomarker in perioperative off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, and the cut-off value established could help to extend earlier detection of myocardial ischemia in this context.

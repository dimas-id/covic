Abstract Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has caused tremendous amounts of economic losses to the swine industry for more than three decades, but its control is still unsatisfactory. A significant amount of information is available for host cell-virus interactions during infection, and it is evident that PRRSV has evolved to equip various strategies to disrupt the host antiviral system and provide favorable conditions for survival. The current study reviews viral strategies for modulations of cellular processes including innate immunity, apoptosis, microRNAs, inflammatory cytokines, and other cellular pathways.

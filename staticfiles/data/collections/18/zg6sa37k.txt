AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate the information given by contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CECT) and ultrasound endoscopy (EUS) regarding vascular involvement of cephalo-pancreatic cancer, data compared with intraoperative findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS We choose to analyze the most often interested vessels by tumor development, such as superior mesenteric artery (SMA), superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and portal vein (PV). The patients included in the study (n=425) had a cephalo-pancreatic tumor diagnosed in our Institute and a positive histology for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The exclusion criteria were: tumors in sites other than the head of the pancreas (including metastases); tumor involvement of common hepatic artery, celiac trunk, inferior cava vein or aorta; CECT or EUS diagnosis performed in another center; and a delay of more than 35 days between the diagnostic imaging and surgery. RESULTS In diagnosing SMA invasion CECT had an accuracy of 84,92% and EUS had an accuracy of 87,39%. In diagnosing PV and SMV involvement, CECT had an accuracy of 84,83% and EUS had an accuracy of 92,17%. The accuracy of the two combined examinations in diagnosing vascular invasion was 93%. CONCLUSONS Both types of examination have showed good accuracies in diagnosing vascular invasion separately. A combination of the two may be used when the CECT result is uncertain as it provides a higher chance of a correct diagnosis. KEY WORDS Pancreatic cancer, Resectability criteria, Vascular invasion.

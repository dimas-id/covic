Last December, SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China, like a new coronavirus, producing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), that as of April 15, 2020, it has infected more than 2,000,000 people worldwide and caused 128,833 deaths. Due to the way SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, endoscopy rooms and endoscopic procedures are an easy source of dissemination, as they fulfill the different characteristics of a contaminated environment for patients and healthcare personnel involved in endoscopic procedures. It is of great importance to establish measures within endoscopy units to prevent and reduce the risk of spreading this infection, creating a safe environment that protects patients and health personnel. A Pubmed search was performed with the following terms: (“COVID-19” OR “coronavirus” OR “SARS-Cov-2”) and (“gastrointestinal” OR “transmission” OR “intestinal” OR “digestive” OR “endoscopy “OR” esophagogastroduodenoscopy “OR” colonoscopy “). The gastroenterology team of our institution, considers that all patients brought to endoscopic procedures should be classified as high risk and presents the recommendations that all healthcare staff in endoscopy units, should take into account to reduce the risk of infection.

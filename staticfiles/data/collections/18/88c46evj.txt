Background and aims: Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV‐2) infection is typically diagnosed histopathologically since intranuclear inclusion bodies (IN/IBs) are demonstrable in the infected lung. However, it is sometimes difficult to identify IN/IBs, particularly in autolyzed tissues or samples from both early and late stages of infection, and other methods were presently developed. Methods: Stray dog samples were evaluated by histopathology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to investigate the status of the CAV‐2 infection on the stray dogs in Korea. Histologic tests were performed, and dogs with pneumonic lungs were further evaluated by IHC and PCR. Results: Pathognomonic IN/IBs were identified in 3 of 213 lungs; CAV‐2 PCR was positive for 27 of 213 pneumonic lungs. A total of 7 of 27 CAV‐2 PCR‐positive lungs were IHC‐positive. No PCR‐negative lung was IHC‐positive. Positive results were primarily detected in the IN/IBs of the bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, and very rarely in the cytoplasm of bronchial epithelial cells. Conclusions: IHC was a more reliable diagnostic method than conventional pathologic methods in the present study, and suggests that IHC should be routinely used in the diagnosis of CAV‐2 infection. Further, PCR alone may not be adequate for CAV‐2 diagnosis.

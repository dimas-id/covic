Mortality in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) has not decreased in the intensive care unit (ICU), despite progress in antimicrobial therapy [1, 2]. Approximately 10% of patients hospitalized with CAP are admitted to the ICU [3]. In a multicenter study by Mongardon et al. in patients with severe pneumococcal CAP admitted to the ICU, the mortality rate was 29%, with high proportions of patients in septic shock and needing mechanical ventilation [4]. Severe CAP is a progressive disease and patients may die despite early and adequate antibiotic treatment. The host local and systemic inflammatory immune response in patients with severe CAP is exacerbated and disproportionate and this is probably the main cause for the high mortality in this specific population, as it contributes to impaired alveolar gas exchange, sepsis and end-organ dysfunction [5]. In this specific population of patients with severe CAP, adjuvant treatments, such as corticosteroids, may be beneficial.

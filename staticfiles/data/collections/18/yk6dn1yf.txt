Spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy forced health facilities to drastically change their organization to face the overwhelming number of infected patients needing hospitalization. The USL (Unit√† Sanitaria Locale) Toscana Centro adopted a protocol of reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the first difficult weeks of the epidemic, consisting in the creation of a Vascular Hub for urgent cases with a profound reorganization of activities, wards, surgical operators, operating blocks and ICU beds. The aim of this paper is to share the protocol with all the vascular community, hoping to help other institutions to face the emergency during the hard weeks coming.

Abstract Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the process by which fecal microbiota are donated from a healthy individual and subsequently transplanted into a diseased or young individual. The mechanism by which FMT is effective is believed to be due to enhanced beneficial microbes, increased microbiome diversity, and restored normal flora. Beneficial gut microorganisms not only play a role in maintaining an intestinal barrier and metabolizing nutrients, but importantly, these microbes help regulate local and systemic immune function. Although FMT has been described for several centuries, only recently has it been utilized as a mainstream therapy in humans and significantly considered for applications in other species. In humans and animals, gastrointestinal diseases are by far the most widely accepted FMT-treatable conditions; however, recent research has shown exceptional promise for FMT being used to treat or prevent other conditions, including those outside of the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, FMT is likely an underutilized, widely-available, and inexpensive tool for improving the health and response to disease in animals. In this review, the effects of FMT on veterinary diseases and potential applications for FMT in animals are discussed.

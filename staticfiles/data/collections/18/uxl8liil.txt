These consisted of clinical trials (n=3), case reports (n=7), case series (n=10), retrospective (n=11) and prospective (n=10) observational studies. Thirty-six studies were conducted in China (88%). The most commonly reported medicine in this systematic review was corticosteroids (n=25), followed by Lopinavir (n=21) and Oseltamivir (n=16). Conclusions This is the first systematic review to date related to the therapeutics used in COVID-19 patients. Only 41 research articles on COVID-19 and therapeutics were found eligible to be included, most conducted in China. Corticosteroid therapy was found to be the most studied medicine in the literature.

Torovirus, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a gastrointestinal infectious agent that has been identified in humans, cattle, pigs, and equines. Toroviruses, except equine torovirus, are difficult to propagate in cell culture; indeed, to date, only the Aichi/2004 strain of bovine torovirus (BToV) has been isolated among the human, bovine, and porcine toroviruses. In the present study, four cytopathogenic BToVs were isolated from diarrheal feces of the cattle using the HRT-18 cell line, and their genetic and antigenic properties were compared. The cytopathogenic features of BToV isolates in HRT-18 cells were similar to those of the Aichi/2004 strain. However, none of the isolates showed cytopathogenic effects in the HRT-18 cells of different origin, suggesting that one significant factor contributing to the cytopathogenicity of BToV depends on properties of the HRT-18 cells themselves. All BToVs isolated were able to agglutinate mouse, but not chicken, erythrocytes, while they lacked receptor-destroying enzyme activity. Analysis of the N terminus of the spike gene showed that three isolates, but not the Gifu-2007TI/E strain, were phylogenetically located in cluster 1 and its analogs and revealed high cross-reactivity with each other, as demonstrated by neutralization (NT) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. The Gifu-2007TI/E strain was classified close to cluster 2 and exhibited relatively low cross-reactivity with these viruses; however, the difference was not sufficient to classify BToVs into serotypes, suggesting that at least two subtypes distinguishable by the structure of the N terminus of the spike gene and that both NT and HI tests may be exist.

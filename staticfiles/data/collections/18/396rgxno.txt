We study an epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate, describing the saturated mass action as well as the psychological effect of certain serious diseases on the community. Firstly, the existence and local stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria are investigated. Then, we prove the occurrence of backward bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation and cusp type Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3. Finally, numerical simulations, including one limit cycle, two limit cycles, unstable homoclinic loop and many other phase portraits are presented. These results show that the psychological effect of diseases and the behavior change of the susceptible individuals may affect the final spread level of an epidemic.

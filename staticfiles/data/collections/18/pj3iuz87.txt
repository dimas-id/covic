RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES To compare image quality on computed tomographic colonography (CTC) acquired at standard dose (STD) and low dose (LD) using filtered-back projection, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 65 symptomatic patients were prospectively enrolled for the study and underwent STD and LD CTC with filtered-back projection, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and MBIR to allow direct per-patient comparison. Objective image noise, subjective image analyses, and polyp detection were assessed. RESULTS Objective image noise analysis demonstrates significant noise reduction using MBIR technique (P < .05) despite being acquired at lower doses. Subjective image analyses were superior for LD MBIR in all parameters except visibility of extracolonic lesions (two-dimensional) and visibility of colonic wall (three-dimensional) where there were no significant differences. There was no significant difference in polyp detection rates (P > .05). Doses: LD (dose-length product, 257.7), STD (dose-length product, 483.6). CONCLUSIONS LD MBIR CTC objectively shows improved image noise using parameters in our study. Subjectively, image quality is maintained. Polyp detection shows no significant difference but because of small numbers needs further validation. Average dose reduction of 47% can be achieved. This study confirms feasibility of using MBIR in this context of CTC in symptomatic population.

PURPOSE To evaluate the patterns of in-stent restenosis (ISR) within femoropopliteal bare metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES) as determined by quantitative angiographic analysis. METHODS Utilizing results from independent core laboratory angiographic imaging analysis, quantitative assessment of the restenotic tissue burden was evaluated in 33 patients with symptomatic femoropopliteal ISR, including 20 lesions in 19 patients (mean age 71.5±8.1 years; 11 men) treated with DES and 14 lesions in 14 patients (mean age 70.6±9.2 years; 9 men) treated with BMS. RESULTS The average time to target lesion revascularization was similar (8.7 months) for the DES and BMS groups. The DES group had significantly less recurrent disease burden (17.1%) compared with the BMS group (27.8%, p=0.03), representing a 39% relative reduction. CONCLUSION Reduced restenotic tissue after endovascular intervention is associated with improved hemodynamics and fewer clinical symptoms and may explain the reduced need for reintervention in restenotic lesions initially treated with DES as compared with BMS. Further study of treatment failure modes may lead to improved device selection criteria to treat patients with peripheral artery disease.

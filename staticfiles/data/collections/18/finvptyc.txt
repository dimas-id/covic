We describe a new microsphere-based multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) using recombinant mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) proteins to detect antibodies to coronaviruses in mouse and rat sera. All the recombinant proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and 3 subunits of spike protein, S1, S2, and Smid, showed positive reactivity in MFI with mouse antisera to 4 MHV strains (MHV-S, -A59, -JHM, and -Nu67) and rat antiserum to a strain of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV-681). The MFI was evaluated for its diagnostic power, with panels of mouse sera classified as positive or negative for anti-MHV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MHV virion antigen and indirect fluorescent antibody assay. The reactivities of 236 naturally infected mouse sera were examined; 227 samples were positive by MFI using S2 antigen (96% sensitivity), and 208 samples were positive using N antigen (88% sensitivity). Based on the assessment by MFI using the S2 and N antigens, only 3 serum samples showed double-negative results, indicating a false-negative rate of 1.3%. In 126 uninfected mouse sera, including 34 ELISA false-positive sera, only 7 samples showed false-positive results by MFI using either the S2 or N antigen (94% specificity). Similarly, the S2 and N antigen-based MFI was 98% sensitive and 100% specific in detecting anticoronavirus antibodies in rat sera. Thus, this MFI-based serologic assay using the S2 and N antigens promises to be a reliable diagnostic method, representing a highly sensitive and specific alternative to traditional ELISA for detection of coronavirus infections in laboratory mouse and rat colonies.

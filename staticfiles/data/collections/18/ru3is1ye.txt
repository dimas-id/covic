As limited as are the studies regarding peritoneal Natural Orifice Trans-Luminal Endoscopic Surgery, mediastinal transluminal experiments are certainly in their infancy. The authors evaluate the parallel development of minimally invasive thoracic surgery with regard to its counterpart in peritoneal laparoscopy to NOTES. Transesophageal interventions by both endosonographic and direct visualization are examined in the context of minimally invasive surgery and mediastinal NOTES. Techniques of viscerotomy creation, visualization, and closure are examined with particular emphasis on mediastinal structures. The state of current interventions is examined. Finally, current morbidity (including infectious complications) and survival outcomes are examined in those animals that have undergone transesophageal exploration.

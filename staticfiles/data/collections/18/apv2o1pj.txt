Nosocomial pneumonia is among the most frequent infections in the intensive care unit with high morbidity and mortality. The decisive factor for treatment failure is inadequate previous antibiotic treatment. Broad spectrum and sufficiently high dosed initial treatment is crucial. To prevent further resistances, the antibiotic treatment must be evaluated early. Depending on the treatment success, treatment has to be changed or terminated. Deescalation is possible and sensible after three days. A treatment period of seven days should not routinely be exceeded. The treatment recommendations should be adapted to local resistances and the local statistics of frequent pathogens. A further factor for treatment decision-making is the risk analysis of the patient (previous treatment, stays in hospitals or nursing homes, concomitant diseases).

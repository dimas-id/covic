Abstract: Environmental virology started with the detection of poliovirus in water. Since then other enteric viruses responsible for gastroenteritis and hepatitis have replaced enteroviruses as the main target for detection. Most shellfish-borne viral outbreaks are restricted to norovirus and hepatitis A virus, making them the main targets for bivalve virological analysis. The inclusion of virus analysis in regulatory standards for viruses in molluscan bivalve samples must overcome several shortcomings such as the technical difficulties and high costs of virus monitoring, the lack of harmonised and standardised assays and the challenge posed by the ever-changing nature of viruses. Nowadays methods are available to detect, quantify and characterise viral pathogens in molluscan shellfish to reduce the risks of shellfish-borne virus diseases.

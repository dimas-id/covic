Biotechnology derives from the Greek words – bios – life, technos – technology and logos – language, proof – that is biotechnology deals with the technical usage of living organisms for various purposes such as food, medicine, pharmaceuticals, recycling. Nowadays we deal with various colours or categories namely 10 introduced (red, blue, green, white, grey, yellow, brown, violet, dark and gold biotechnology) by Dr. Rita R. Colwell in 2003 and presented in this book. Other categories are also in use, the division into plant biotechnology, animal biotechnology, biotechnology of microorganisms and its colonies, cell culture biotechnologies, biotechnology of subcellular systems. The word ‘biotechnology’ was used for the first time by the director of the cattle utilization cooperative and Hungarian great land owner Karl Ereky and latter Hungarian Food minister. He published a book with the title: “Biotechnology of the meat, fat and milk production in agricultural large concerns for scientific sophisticated farmers” in 1919 in Berlin. His idea was to produce consumer goods with the use of living organisms called biotechnology. That was nothing new, but the word was new.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The importance of time in acute stroke is well-established. Using the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial data, we explored the effect of multimodal imaging (CT perfusion and/or CT angiography) versus noncontrast CT alone on time to treatment and outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined 3 groups: 1) subjects with baseline CTP and CTA (CTP+CTA), 2) subjects with baseline CTA without CTP (CTA), and 3) subjects with noncontrast head CT alone. The demographics, treatment time intervals, and clinical outcomes in these groups were studied. RESULTS Of 656 subjects enrolled in the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial, 90 (13.7%) received CTP and CTA, 216 (32.9%) received CTA (without CTP), and 342 (52.1%) received NCCT alone. Median times for the CTP+CTA, CTA, and NCCT groups were as follows: stroke onset to IV tPA (120.5 versus 117.5 versus 120 minutes; P = .5762), IV tPA to groin puncture (77.5 versus 81 versus 91 minutes; P = .0043), groin puncture to endovascular therapy start (30 versus 38 versus 44 minutes; P = .0001), and endovascular therapy start to end (63 versus 46 versus 74 minutes; P < .0001). Compared with NCCT, the CTA group had better outcomes in the endovascular arm (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.36-3.31; adjusted for age, NIHSS score, and time from onset to IV tPA). The CTP+CTA group did not have better outcomes compared with the NCCT group. CONCLUSIONS Use of CTA with or without CTP did not delay IV tPA or endovascular therapy compared with NCCT in the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial.

Effective medical rehabilitation of patients with pneumonia caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is critical for the recovery and optimization of emergency and specialty care outcomes. In this regard, it is relevant to develop a scientifically based medical rehabilitation program for patients with the coronavirus infectious disease COVID-19, whose composition and structure includes methods and tools that have proven effectiveness. AIM To develop evidence-based approaches to medical rehabilitation for patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection. RESULTS The clinical effects and suggested mechanisms of action of rehabilitation technologies in patients with pneumonia, including those associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection, are considered in Detail. The most studied of the physical methods that have a proven effect are physical exercises, breathing exercises, the complex effect of factors of resort therapy, hydrotherapy, which affect the main clinical manifestations of the underlying disease, astheno-neurotic syndrome and increasing immunity. Clinical recommendations for medical rehabilitation are proposed and its promising methods are considered. CONCLUSION Regular generalization and analysis of high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate various physical methods of treatment of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection is Necessary, which serve as a basis for the development of future valid clinical recommendations. Timely and adequate specialized medical rehabilitation care is critical to maintaining the health, reducing disability and mortality of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection.

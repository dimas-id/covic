PURPOSE To investigate the hypothesis that four-dimensional (4D) transcatheter intraarterial perfusion (TRIP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can quantify immediate perfusion changes after radiofrequency (RF) ablation in rabbit VX2 liver tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine New Zealand White rabbits were used to surgically implant VX2 liver tumors. During ultrasound-guided RF ablation, tumors received either a true or sham ablation. After selective catheterization of the left hepatic artery under x-ray fluoroscopy, we acquired pre- and post-RF ablation 4D TRIP MR images using 3 mL of 2.5% intraarterial gadopentetate dimeglumine. Two regions-of-interest were drawn upon each tumor to generate signal-intensity time curves. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to provide semiquantitative perfusion measurements that were compared using a paired t-test (Î± = 0.05). Ablated tissue was visually confirmed on pathology using Evans blue dye. RESULTS Mean AUC perfusion of VX2 tumors for the true ablation group decreased by 92.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.3%-100%), from 1913 (95% CI: 1557, 2269) before RF ablation to 76.6 (95% CI: 18.4, 134.8) after RF ablation (a.u., P < 0.001). Sham-ablated tumors demonstrated no significant perfusion changes. CONCLUSION 4D TRIP MRI can quantify liver tumor perfusion reductions in VX2 rabbits after RF ablation. This MRI technique can potentially be used to improve tumor response assessment at the time of RF ablation.

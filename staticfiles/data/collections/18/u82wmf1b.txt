OBJECTIVES In the current study, we present our pure laparoscopic heminephrectomy experience in 13 patients with horseshoe kidney (HK). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 13 patients with HK underwent pure laparoscopic heminephrectomy (Transperitoneal= 7, Retroperitoneal = 6) due to benign and malign renal conditions (non-functional hydronephrotic and/or infected kidney = 12, kidney mass = 1). RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 45.8 years. The mean operating time was 140 minutes, and estimated blood loss was 131 ml. The mean hospital stay was 2.3 days. Division of istmus was performed with stapler in 5 patients, ultrasonic scalpel in 3, 15 mm Hem-o-lok clip in 3, 10 mm LigaSure vessel seal system in one and endoscopic suture by 0 polyglactin in one patient without bleeding. Twelve patients underwent pure laparoscopic heminephrectomy due to nonfunctional hydronephrotic and or infected kidney. One patient underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic right heminephrectomy due to kidney mass. According to modifies Clavien classification, Grade I complication (wound infection) occurred in one patient (7.7%) who underwent heminephrectomy due to non-functional kidney. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic heminephrectomy seems to be technically feasible and safe for benign and malignant diseases in patients with HK.

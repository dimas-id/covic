The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of tea saponins on oxidative stress induced by cyclophosphamide in chickens. One hundred twenty chickens were randomly divided into 5 groups. Groups 3 to 4 received intramuscular injection of cyclophosphamide to induce oxidative stress and immunosuppression. After that, groups 2 and 4 were orally administered tea saponins in drinking water for 7 d. Then, groups 1 to 4 were immunized with a live, bivalent vaccine of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus. Blood samples were collected for analysis of oxidative parameters and specific antibody titers, and splenocytes were prepared for lymphocyte proliferative assay. The results showed that administration of tea saponins significantly increased total antioxidant capacity, total superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione, ascorbic acid, and Î±-tocopherol, and decreased malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl. Enhanced immune responses, such as lymphocyte proliferation induced by concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharides, and serum Newcastle disease virus- and infectious bronchitis virus-specific antibodies were also observed in chickens injected with or without cyclophosphamide. In addition, no side effects were found in chickens throughout the study. Therefore, tea saponins may be a potential agent to improve imunosuppression induced by oxidative stress in chickens.

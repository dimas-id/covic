1. The species‐composition, number of individuals and biomass per one‐hectare are given. The three groups of areas studied were: (1) bare pastures, with an intermediate number of bird species, few individuals and high biomass of mainly carnivorous and insectivorous birds; (2) conifer plantations 1 to 5 years old, with the smallest number of bird species and the smallest biomass, but an intermediate number of individuals; (3) plantations six to twenty years old, with the highest number of both species and individuals of birds, but only intermediate biomass. 2. The change from pasture to forest occurs about six to ten years after planting. The last forest birds come in about 20 years after planting. 3. Birds have an important role in establishing the shrub layer and mixing some tree‐species into the plantation, by dissemination. 4. Throughout the entire successional series the bird population seems to have a kernel of species, while other species come or go and/or change in density with the stages.

The aim of this chapter is to understand how States combat money laundering and its possible links to organized crime and other financial crimes. The illegal flow of capital poses a great threat to States. Through international joint actions, States can fight crime and curtail the enjoyment of property illegally acquired through criminal activity, particularly with respect to the acquisition of works of art on the black market.

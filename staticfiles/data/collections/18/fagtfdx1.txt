Since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Taiwan 2020.01.21. Several family cluster infections were found later. This study aimed to report family cluster infections and observe subsequent development. We collected domestic family cluster infections among COVID-19 confirmed cases from 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020. There were three domestic family clusters infections in this period. The first cluster was cases 19 to 23. The infectious source was a Taiwanese passenger from Zhejiang. The second cluster was cases 24 to 26 and the third cluster was cases 27 to 32. The infectious sources of the latter clusters are currently uncertain. All contacts of three clusters have been isolated and no new confirmed cases have been identified to date. Some measures which have reduced the spread of these three clusters included: First, high suspicion of COVID-19 for unexplained pneumonia is very important for early detection. Second, immediate epidemic investigation is taken especially COVID-19 is infectious during the incubation period. Third, when the second and third clusters could not find infectious sources, CECC's press conference let the public know immediately the epidemic situation, so that people could raise their awareness and seek medical treatment or quarantine.

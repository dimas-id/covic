BACKGROUND Total extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair gained popularity in the past two decades for its advantage, especially single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for TEP inguinal hernia repair (SILS TEP), however, which is a technically demanding procedure. METHODS The study retrospectively analyzed 6 cases of the superior of inguinal ligament approach of S-SILS TEP repair from August 2015 to July 2016. A detailed review of medical records and the perioperative data including patient characteristics, operative details, and postoperative hospital stay was conducted. RESULTS S-SILS TEP repair for inguinal hernia was successfully completed for 6 patients, and the mean operation time was 59.2 minutes (range 55-70 minutes), and the mean blood loss was 7.5 mL (range 5-15 mL) and the postoperative recovery was uneventful about 3 days after operation with a single wound over inguinal ligament. CONCLUSIONS S-SILS TEP repair provides a new operative view, which combines the advantage of laparoscopic and open surgery, especially in surgical technique and minimal invasiveness. Our experience suggests that the S-SILS TEP repair may be a safe and feasible alternative in inguinal hernias repair.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the level of and factors involved in influenza virus subtype H1N1 (H1N1)-related preventive behaviors and mental distress among university students in Guangzhou. PARTICIPANTS Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data for 825 students from 2 universities. RESULTS A total of 49.7% of the participants held misconception(s) concerning H1N1 transmission. Less than 30% washed their hands >10 times/d; 72.3% did not reduce the frequency of touching their mouths, noses, and eyes; only 9.3% would wear face masks if they had influenza-like symptoms. However, 45% worried that one/one's family would contract H1N1, 10.7% were panicking/feeling depressed/feeling emotionally disturbed as a result of H1N1, and 14.9% were fearful about the WHO's H1N1 pandemic announcement. Almost all cognitive variables of this study were significantly associated with mental distress caused by fear of H1N1 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.29-3.81), but very few were associated with adoption of preventive measures (OR = 0.65-1.90). CONCLUSIONS Preventive measures are warranted to alleviate distress in the population studied via health education and promotion.

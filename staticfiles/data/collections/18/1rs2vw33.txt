Biosynthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) was achieved by utilizing the reducing and capping potential of leaf, stem and callus aqueous extracts of Mussaenda frondosa.The bioreduced ZnO-NPs were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis spectroscopy), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. UV–visible spectra of ZnO-NPs showed a strong absorption peak at 370, 376 and 373 nm corresponding to the band gap energy of 3.33, 3.27 and 3.30 eV for ZnO-NPs obtained from leaf (L-ZnO-NP), stem (S-ZnO-NP) and callus (C-ZnO-NP) aqueous extracts, respectively. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of hexagonal wurtzite structures having an average grain size between 5 and 20 nm in diameter. FTIR spectra revealed the presence of stretching vibrations of –O–H, C–H, C–N, C = O groups involved in reduction and stabilization of nanoparticles. SEM images recognize the presence of spongy, spherical, porous agglomerated nanoparticles. DLS analysis and zeta potential values validated the stability of ZnO-NPs. The present investigation puts light on the photocatalytic activity and biological (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anticancerous) applications of ZnO-NPs. The current study is an attempt to describe an effective, simple and eco-friendly method of ZnO-NP synthesis and to evaluate its potential for various industrial and medical applications.

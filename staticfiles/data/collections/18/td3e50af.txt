During the past few months, a pandemic originating from China named new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has shown how vulnerable the world is. To date, no medication supported by randomized clinical trials has been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. At the time of writing of this paper, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible - according to modest estimations - for around 4 million of infections and 300 000 deaths. Unveiling details of patomechanism, in fatal cases the role of immune dysregulation, namely cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been discovered. Based on the current knowledge, interleukin-6 (IL6) plays a pivotal role in COVID-19 associated CRS. Case reports and result of small case series suggest efficacy of an IL6 inhibitor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) in treating CRS. Authors describe a case and review recent knowledge on the treatment of COVID-19. To our knowledge, the first case of severe COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome - treated succesfully with IL6 monoclocal antibody at a Hungarian department of infectology - is presented here.

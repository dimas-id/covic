PURPOSE To compare technical success, clinical success, complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time for osteoid osteoma thermal (radiofrequency or microwave) ablation using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with two-axis fluoroscopic navigational overlay versus conventional computed tomography (CT) guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify all osteoid osteoma ablations performed over a 5.5-year period at a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. Twenty-five ablations (15 radiofrequency and 10 microwave) in 23 patients undergoing fluoroscopic CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma ablation were compared to 35 ablations (35 radiofrequency) in 32 patients undergoing ablation via conventional CT guidance. Dose area product and dose length product were recorded for CBCT and conventional CT, respectively, and converted to effective doses. Technical success, clinical success (cessation of pain and medication use 1 month after ablation), complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time were compared. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Twenty-two of 25 (88.0%) CBCT and 31 of 35 (88.6%) conventional CT-guided ablations achieved immediate clinical success. There were two minor complications in each group and no major complications. Mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower for CBCT compared to CT guidance (0.12 vs. 0.39 mSv, p = 0.02). Mean total room utilization time for CBCT was longer (133.5 vs. 97.5 min, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Fluoroscopic CBCT guidance for percutaneous osteoid osteoma ablation yields similar technical and clinical success, reduced radiation dose, and increased total room utilization time compared to conventional CT guidance.

Minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenctomy (MIPD) is a technically challenging procedure. Current laparoscopic equipment with its limited range of motion, poor surgeon ergonomics, and lack of 3D view has limited the addition of MIPD. The robotic platform is able to overcome these limitations, allowing the recreation of time-honored open surgical principles of this procedure through a minimally invasive approach. We present here the technical aspects of the University of Pittsburgh robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenctomy.

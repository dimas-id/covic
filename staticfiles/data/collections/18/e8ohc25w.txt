COVID‐19 has become a global health concern. HIV‐infected patients are particularly vulnerable to COVID‐19 due to their immune‐compromised status. The clinical manifestations and clinical outcomes of these patients are not clear. In this report, we presented two special COVID‐19 patients with HIV infection and other comorbidities. We described the clinical characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatments and clinical outcomes of both patients. One patient with prior HIV‐infection continued anti‐HIV treatment when diagnosed with COVID‐19. The other patient was newly diagnosed with HIV‐infection when diagnosed with COVID‐19 and had not begun anti‐HIV treatment. Both patients were treated with anti‐viral, antibiotics, oxygen treatment and supportive care and recovered from severe pneumonia. The experience of these two cases suggested that COVID‐19 patients with HIV infection could still have satisfactory clinical outcomes following proper medical care.

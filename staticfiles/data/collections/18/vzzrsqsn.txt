Technical innovations in surgical techniques, anaesthesia, critical care and a spatial understanding of the intra-hepatic anatomy of the liver, have led to an increasing number of liver resections being performed all over the world. However, the number of complications directly attributed to the procedure and leading to inadequate or poor hepatic functional status in the postoperative period remains a matter of concern. There has always been a problem of arriving at a consensus in the definition of the term: postoperative liver failure (PLF). The burgeoning rate of living donor liver transplants, with lives of perfectly healthy donors involved, has mandated a consensual definition, uniform diagnosis and protocol for management of PLF. The absence of a uniform definition has led to poor comparison among various trials. PLF remains a dreaded complication in resection of the liver, with a reported incidence of up to 8 % [1], and mortality rates of up to 30â€“70 % have been quoted [2]. Several studies have quoted a lower incidence of PLF in eastern countries, but when it occurs the mortality is as high as in the West [3].

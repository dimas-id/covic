The coronavirus has taken the West by surprise It has called into question basic assumptions about globalisation, how our society is organised, how safe we actually are and to what extent we control the world around us The virus arrived when we were without the proper conceptual framework to deal with a new type of virus, and we could not have imagined how much of a social challenge it would represent The novelty of the situation has made most of us feel strangely confused, numb and calm, and in many cases has left us not knowing what to do with ourselves This satirical review seeks to put some distance and detachment between us and the situation and give us an outside perspective of what the corona crisis can teach us, both at the individual and social levels Before the situation becomes the ?new normal?, we should take the time to extract some lessons from this mess

Publisher Summary Disease processes of the central nervous system (CNS) accompanied by demyelination may be the result of a viral infection or the consequence of an immunopathological reaction directed against myelin. In acute viral infections, the infection of oligodendroglial cells, leading to cell destruction, may be the main mechanism for inducing this neuropathological lesion. In the case of a persistent virus infection in oligodendroglia cells, however, it is conceivable that functional impairment of oligodendroglia cells, or the induction of an immune reaction to the agent that may cross-react with brain antigens, could eventually cause demyelination. Therefore, pathogenic studies on subacute or chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitides in association with viral infections may provide information on the mechanisms involved in demyelination. In rats, depending on the biological property of the virus material used, the genetic background and immune response of the host, a subacute or late demyelinating encephalomyelitis can be induced, accompanied by primary demyelination. This provides a model for analysis of the virus and host factors interacting in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

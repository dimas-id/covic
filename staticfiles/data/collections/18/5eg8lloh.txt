Crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaics dominate the global solar cell market and will continue to do so in the absence of a major, commercially ready technological breakthrough. Emerging photovoltaic materials have the opportunity to augment silicon in a tandem configuration, where two or more solar cells are connected to more efficiently harvest sunlight. Recently in Science, Xu et al. and Hou et al. reported parallel processes to realize high-efficiency monolithic perovskite/c-Si tandems.

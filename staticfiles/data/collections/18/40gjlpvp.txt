INTRODUCTION The necessity of mesh fixation in laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of mesh fixation versus no fixation in laparoscopic TEP repair for primary inguinal hernia. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles from January 1992 until May 2020. All trials that compared fixation versus no fixation in TEP repairs for inguinal herniae were included. Recurrent and femoral herniae were excluded from the current analysis. The primary outcome measure was recurrence while secondary outcomes included postoperative pain at 24 h, mean operative time, urinary retention, and seroma rates. Random effects models were used to calculate pooled effect size estimates. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out. RESULTS Eight randomized controlled trials were included capturing 557 patients and 715 inguinal herniae. On random effects analysis, there were no significant differences between fixation and no fixation with respect to recurrence (RD 0.00, 95% CI = - 0.01 to 0.01, p = 1.00), operative time (MD 1.58 min, 95% CI = - 0.22 to 3.37, p = 0.09), seroma (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.28 to 1.74, p = 0.44), or urinary retention (RD 0.09, 95% CI = - 0.18 to 0.36, p = 0.53). However, fixation was associated with more pain at 24 h (MD 0.93, 95% CI = 0.20 to 1.66, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Mesh fixation in laparoscopic TEP repair for primary inguinal herniae is associated with increased postoperative pain at 24 h but similar recurrence, seroma, and urinary retention. Therefore, it may be omitted.

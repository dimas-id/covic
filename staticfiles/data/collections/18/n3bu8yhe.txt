OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of microsporidiosis in HIV-infected patients with and without diarrhoea and to characterize alterations in mucosal architecture and brush border enzyme activities in patients with microsporidiosis. PATIENTS A total of 259 HIV-infected patients undergoing oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy because of diarrhoea (n = 123) or other symptoms (n = 136) were studied. METHODS Patients were evaluated for the presence of microsporidia by electron microscopy of duodenal biopsies. Brush border enzyme activities were measured by histochemistry and mucosal architecture was determined by three-dimensional morphometry in biopsies from patients with microsporidiosis and compared with biopsies from a subgroup of HIV-infected patients with or without other enteropathogens. RESULTS Enterocytozoon bieneusi was detected in 17 patients and Encephalitozoon intestinalis was detected in two patients. Microsporidiosis was significantly more frequent in patients with chronic diarrhoea (19.1%; P < 0.0001) or in patients with acute diarrhoea (7.2%; P = 0.04) than in patients without diarrhoea (1.5%). Microsporidiosis was associated with lactase deficiency (P = 0.03) and a reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.028) and alpha-glucosidase (P = 0.025) at the basal part of the villus compared with brush border enzymes in patients without enteropathogens. Patients with microsporidia had reduced villus height (P = 0.043) and a villus surface reduced by 40% (P = 0.004) compared with patients with enteropathogens other than microsporidia. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms the association between microsporidia and diarrhoea. The pathophysiologic mechanism by which microsporidia cause diarrhoea appears in part to be malabsorption, caused by a reduction of absorptive mucosal surface and impairment of enterocyte function.

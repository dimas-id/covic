Parkinson's Disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is expected to increase in coming decades as the American population continues to age. Although the motor dysfunction (bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity) of Parkinson's Disease is well described in the literature, the nonmotor dysfunction related to autonomic system changes is not as commonly addressed. Ironically, nonmotor changes, such as seborrhea, sialorrhea, hyperhidrosis, and sensory denervation occur earlier in the disease process and exert a profound effect on patients' quality of life. The depletion of dopamine, a critically important neurotransmitter, is the critical pathology of Parkinson's disease. Therapies targeting this abnormality and the effect of insufficient dopamine itself can affect the integumentary system and potentially wound healing. The purpose of this review is to describe changes in the autonomic nervous system due to Parkinson's Disease with a focused overview of common skin and wound care issues that may affect wound care clinician practice. Implications for nurses and other clinicians caring for Parkinson's Disease patients include surveillance for melanoma and other skin cancers, skin protection against excessive moisture or the effects of insufficient moisture, monitoring of wound healing progress, and interventions to prevent or ameliorate complications of immobility.

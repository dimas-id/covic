Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a minimally invasive procedure providing nutritional benefits to malnourished patients. Although a past history of celiotomy is not a contradiction for PEG construction, this procedure is rarely undertaken in post-esophagectomy patients, for two reasons: anatomically limited gastric spaces and high susceptibility to pulmonary aspiration. To overcome these limitations, we developed an original method of introducing PEG with jejunal extension for esophagectomized patients with retrosternal gastric pull-up reconstruction. The procedures were as follows: (1) confirmation of endoscopic transillumination of the antrum; (2) test puncture of the antral wall and subsequent gastropexy using a double-needle device; (3) insertion of a needle jejunostomy catheter into the antrum; (4) direct catheter cannulation to the pylorus and introduction of a feeding tube into the jejunum. We successfully carried out this procedure in three male patients (70-78 years old): two suffering from repetitive aspiration pneumonia and one with extensive recurrence of esophageal carcinoma. The operative times ranged 15-50 min. There were no PEG-associated complications. Of note, none of the patients experienced aspiration pneumonia after PEG construction. Our novel method appears to be a promising approach to managing esophagectomized patients because of its feasibility and the potential to prevent postoperative pulmonary aspiration.

The use of bioadhesives, tissue sealants, and hemostatic agents has allowed for increased use of minimally invasive techniques for complex reconstructive urologic procedures. Hemostatic agents can facilitate clot formation through enzymatic reactions with host factors, mechanical compression, or a combination of the two. Tissue sealants and bioadhesives act through polymerization between themselves and adjacent tissues. This article reviews the unique features, mechanism of action, safety profile, and prototypical applications of the agents most commonly used in urologic surgery.

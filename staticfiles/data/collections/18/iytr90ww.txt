We previously reported increase in leucine-rich Î±2-glycoprotein (LRG) concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with cognitive decline in humans. To investigate relationship between LRG expression in the brain and memory impairment, we analyzed transgenic mice overexpressing LRG in the brain (LRG-Tg) focusing on hippocampus. Immunostaining and Western blotting revealed age-related increase in LRG expression in hippocampal neurons in 8-, 24-, and 48-week-old controls and LRG-Tg. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests indicated retained spatial memory in 8- and 24-week-old LRG-Tg, while deteriorated in 48-week-old LRG-Tg compared with age-matched controls. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials declined with age in LRG-Tg compared with controls at 8, 24, and 48 weeks. Paired-pulse ratio decreased with age in LRG-Tg, while increased in controls. As a result, long-term potentiation was retained in 8- and 24-week-old LRG-Tg, whereas diminished in 48-week-old LRG-Tg compared with age-matched controls. Electron microscopy observations revealed fewer synaptic vesicles and junctions in LRG-Tg compared with age-matched controls, which became significant with age. Hippocampal LRG overexpression contributes to synaptic dysfunction, which leads to memory impairment with advance of age.

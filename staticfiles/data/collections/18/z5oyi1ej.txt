Many factors can influence then spread of viruses and respiratory infections. Studies have suggested that there is a direct relationship between environmental issues and population density with cases of COVID-19. In this sense, this research aims to analyze, through correlational study and Krigagem, the relationship of meteorological and demographic variables with cases of COVID-19 in regions of subtropical climate in Brazil. The results suggest that population and demographic density (hab/km2) are risk factors for the spread of SAR-CoV-2 and an increase in the daily case record of COVID-19. The distribution of cases according to age group did not present a significant disparity between men and women. Relative humidity (RH)%, average temperature Celsius, minimum temperature Celsius, maximum temperature Celsius, wind speed m/s and daily precipitation (rain) mm show negative relationships with cases of COVID-19 in regions of humid equatorial climate. Analysis between associations of environmental factors, wind, temperature and HR in a region is extremely important to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. In the northern region of Brazil, low wind speed, high temperatures and high RH are observed, environmental factors that, when associated, reduce the transmission process because it hinders the movement of the virus in the environment. In this sense, it is suggested that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in this region is disseminated through fluids in the air between man/man and by contact between objects/men. Therefore, strategic public policies to combat the pandemic must consider the environmental factors of the regions involved and control and/or blocking the transit of people.

The focus of this review is to discuss findings in the last 10 years that have advanced our understanding of human NK cell responses to dengue virus. We will review recently identified interactions of activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells with dengue virus, human NK responses to natural dengue infection and highlight possible interactions by which NK cells may shape adaptive immune responses. T cell responses to natural dengue infection will be reviewed by Laura Rivino in Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-8727-1_17. With the advent of numerous dengue vaccine clinical trials, we will also review T and NK cell immune responses to dengue virus vaccination. As our understanding of the diverse functions of NK cell has advanced, it has become increasingly clear that human NK cell responses to viral infections are more complicated than initially recognized.

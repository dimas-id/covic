Abstract A feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) mutant, monkey/BJ-22/2008/CHN, was isolated from intestinal contents of a diarrheic monkey in Beijing, China. The virus was identified by morphology and physicochemical characteristics, and specific fragments were obtained by PCR using consensus primers of parvovirus and specific primers of FPV. Sequence of the full-length VP2 gene of the isolated FPV was determined and analyzed by comparison with reference FPV and canine parvovirus (CPV) isolates, showing high homology with FPV (98.75%) and CPV (98.15%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolated FPV formed a monophyletic branch in FPV cluster which differed from the other 11 FPV isolates from China and other countries. The isolated virus caused typical clinical symptoms of FPV in cats. This is the first report on isolation of FPV from a monkey.

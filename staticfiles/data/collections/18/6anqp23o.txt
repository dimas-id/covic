The world is currently suffering through one the greatest crises of the last century. The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is taking an enormous toll on public health and stretching medical resources in an unprecedented fashion. Our priorities are rightly focusing on meeting this existential threat. Nonetheless, we wish to call to attention that during major catastrophes the health consequences of chronic diseases, in particular cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs), continue unabated. In fact, new and serious problems arise part-and-parcel with the catastrophe and conspire to hamper our already imperfect ability to control CMRFs1,2. Our objective is to raise awareness that we need to anticipate (and not just be reactive to) the possible coming of a second crisis we term "disastrous CMRFs". This refers to the worsening of CMRFs and their control rates during and following a major disaster. Health care providers, in particular cardiologists, need to recognize the potential for this serious problem as it could promote a burgeoning of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality if not addressed. The COVID-19 pandemic should also serve as a wake-up call to the antiquated flaws in our healthcare model that collude to undermine the successful management of CMRFs in general. This current crisis can be a catalyst for optimizing practices and creating critical new capacities that will be beneficial moving forward and serve as a bulwark against future crises.

OBJECT Flow diversion has emerged as a promising treatment alternative for cerebral aneurysms. As a new device, treatment-related events and complications are currently being characterized. METHODS Data on 100 consecutive procedures with the intention to use flow diversion were prospectively collected and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Ninety-five aneurysms were treated in 93 patients during 100 consecutive procedures in which the intention was to treat an intracranial aneurysm with flow diversion. Death occurred in 1% and permanent morbidity in 1%. However, periprocedural technical complications occurred in 35% of the procedures and included proximal device migration in 12%, incomplete device expansion in 9%, catheter-induced vasospasm in 6%, and artery perforation from the wire in 3%. Perioperative clinical events were seen in 28% (thromboembolism and access site complications were the most common, being observed in 6.5% of patients). Worsened extraocular motility was seen in 5.4% and resolved in 4/5 patients. Mean clinical follow-up was 17 months. There were no late clinical or technical issues resulting in permanent deficits, although one patient suffered worsening ataxia. Overall, using very strict angiographic criteria, complete angiographic obliteration was 50% at 6 months and 69% after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion for intracranial aneurysms is a safe and effective treatment. Technical and clinical events are common in the perioperative period. Careful perioperative care and proper management of technical and clinical events encountered is key to achieving low morbidity and mortality. Late clinical events can occur but are unlikely to result in permanent complications.

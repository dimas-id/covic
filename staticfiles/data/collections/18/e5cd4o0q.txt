BACKGROUND: Dietary fibers (DFs) are known as potential formulations in human health due to their beneficial effects in control of life-threatening chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus, obesity and cancer. In recent decades scientists around the globe have shown tremendous interest to evaluate the interplay between DFs and gastrointestinal (GIT) microbiota. Evidences from various epidemiological and clinical trials have revealed that DFs modulate formation and metabolic activities of the microbial communities residing in the human GIT which in turn play significant roles in maintaining health and well-being. Furthermore, interestingly, a rapidly growing literature indicates success of DFs being prebiotics in immunomodulation, namely the stimulation of innate, cellular and humoral immune response, which could also be linked with their significant roles in modulation of the probiotics (live beneficial microorganisms). SCOPE AND APPROACH: The main focus of the current review is to expressively highlight the importance of DFs being prebiotics in human health in association with their influence on gut microbiota. Now in order to significantly achieve the promising health benefits from these prebiotics, it is aimed to develop novel formulations to enhance and scale up their efficacy. Therefore, finally, herein unlike previously published articles, we highlighted different kinds of prebiotic and probiotic formulations which are being regarded as hot research topics among the scientific community now a days. CONCLUSION: The information in this article will specifically provide a platform for the development of novel functional foods the demands for which has risen drastically in recent years.

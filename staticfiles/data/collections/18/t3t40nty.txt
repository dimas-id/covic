Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is the aetiologic agent of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), a highly contagious enteric disease that is threatening the swine industry globally. Since PED was first reported in Southern Vietnam in 2009, the disease has spread throughout the country and caused substantial economic losses. To identify PEDVs responsible for the recent outbreaks, the full‐length spike (S) gene of 25 field PEDV strains collected from seven northern provinces of Vietnam was sequenced and analysed. The sequence analysis revealed that the S genes of Vietnamese PEDVs were heterogeneous and classified into four genotypes, namely North America and Asian non‐S INDEL, Asian non‐S INDEL, new S INDEL and classical S INDEL. This study reported the pre‐existence of US‐like PEDV strains in Vietnam. Thirteen Vietnamese variants had a truncated S protein that was 261 amino acids shorter than the normal protein. We also detected one novel variant with an 8‐amino acid insertion located in the receptor‐binding region for porcine aminopeptidase N. Compared to the commercial vaccine strains, the emerging Vietnamese strains were genetically distant and had various amino acid differences in epitope regions and N‐glycosylation sites in the S protein. The development of novel vaccines based on the emerging Vietnamese strains may be contributive to the control of the current PED outbreaks.

I moved out of our shared bedroom of nearly 10 years on 3/22/2020. It was not a difficult decision as we have two young children and wondered what would happen if both of us became ill at the same time. As a Maternal‐Fetal medicine physician in New York City, I was acutely aware of the coming COVID‐19 crisis, and its potential ramifications on the health of my family, friends, patients and community. I am trained to function well in emergencies, and in this case, it was a quick and seemingly logical next‐step to sleep separately.

Beta-lactamase (ampC) in general causes the onset of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria against the β-lactam antibiotics. Morganella morganii which belongs to the Proteae tribe of the Enterobacteriaceae family is a Gram-negative bacillus. Gram-negative bacteria are the key problematic agents among the human population in overexpressing resistance against β-lactam antibiotics. These β-lactam antibiotics being experimentally well studied still lack the key information and mechanism for their resistance. The structural information of the ampC protein is unknown and poorly studied; hence, it is the need of the hour to find effective inhibitors against it. In our study, the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of ampC protein from Morganella morganii was performed using a comparative modelling approach. The predicted structure was energetically stabilized and functional conformations were mapped through 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation runs. Also, Ramachandran plot shows the model to be stereo-chemically stable with most residues found under core allowed regions. Drug screening with several experimentally tested inhibitors was then confirmed to check the activity against ampC protein using an AutoDock tool. The results suggested OncoglabrinolC molecule as the best inhibitor (out of 21 drug molecules) with a binding affinity of - 11.44 kcal/mol. Anti-bacterial/anti-parasitic inhibitors have not only been used against bacterial infections, but later reports have also shown them to work against deadly viruses such as SARS-CoV2. This key structural and inhibitory information is certain to help in the discovery of specific and potent substitute therapeutic drugs and the development of experimental procedures against human infection.

Single-port surgery, which is also called single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), laparoscopic single-site surgery, or single-port access surgery, has been performed in several countries. However, it has not been widely adopted throughout the world because there still remain some challenging problems to be solved, in terms of safety and technology, and the majority of devices specific to SILS are under development and have not been approved by the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law. Herein, we introduce single-incision access using existing surgical devices that will give us the opportunity to adopt SILS to our hospital.

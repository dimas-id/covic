BACKGROUND Modifications to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) are aimed at decreasing abdominal wall trauma and improving cosmetic outcome. Although single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) provides excellent cosmetic results, the procedure is technically challenging and expensive compared to the conventional laparoscopic approach. OBJECTIVES To describe a novel, hybrid technique combining SILS and conventional laparoscopy using minimal abdominal wall incisions. METHODS Fifty patients diagnosed with symptomatic cholelithiasis were operated using two reusable 5 mm trocars inserted through a single 15 mm umbilical incision and a single 2-3 mm epigastric port. This technique was clubbed "minimal incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy" (MILC). RESULTS MILC was completed in 49 patients (98%). In five patients an additional 3 mm trocar was used and in 2 patients the epigastric trocar was switched to a 5 mmtrocar. The procedure was converted to CLC in one patient. Mean operative time was 29 minutes (range 18-60) and the average postoperative hospital stay was 22 hours (range 6-50). There were no postoperative complications and the cosmetic results were rated excellent by the patients. CONCLUSIONS MILC is an intuitive, easy-to-learn and reproducible technique and requires small changes from CLC. As such, MILC may be an attractive alternative, avoiding the cost and complexity drawbacks associated with SILS.

Protein microarrays are versatile tools for parallel, miniaturized screening of binding events involving large numbers of immobilized proteins in a time- and cost-effective manner. They are increasingly applied for high-throughput protein analyses in many research areas, such as protein interactions, expression profiling and target discovery. While conventionally made by the spotting of purified proteins, recent advances in technology have made it possible to produce protein microarrays through in situ cell-free synthesis directly from corresponding DNA arrays. This article reviews recent developments in the generation of protein microarrays and their applications in proteomics and diagnostics.

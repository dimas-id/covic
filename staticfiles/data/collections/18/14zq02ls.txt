PURPOSE In order to avoid the microbiological risks linked to human serum albumin macroaggregates (MAA) used for lung perfusion scintigraphy, we developed a new starch-based Tc-99m potential radiopharmaceutical. METHODS Microparticles were prepared from oxidised starch coupled to natural polyamine for Tc-99m complexation. Suspensions were formulated as ready-to-use kits for easy one-step labelling procedures. RESULTS Particle-size analysis, electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy were performed for microparticle characterisation, and gave a typical size distribution ranging from 7 to 63 microm, with a homogenous population of spherical or oval-shaped microparticles. Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and was stable for at least 8 h. When challenged with histidine and human plasma, labelling was also stable. Dynamic scintigraphic acquisitions and biodistribution studies conducted on healthy Wistar rats showed a tracer accumulation with more than 80% of the ID in the lungs after 15 min. CONCLUSIONS With clinically significant characteristics such as a lung half-life of 3 h, a lung-to-vascular ratio of 900, and a lung-to-liver ratio of 90, starch-based microparticles exhibit all the qualities for an effective new lung perfusion agent.

BACKGROUND Angiographic parametric imaging (API), based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is a quantitative imaging tool that may be used to extract contrast flow parameters related to hemodynamic conditions in abnormal pathologies such as intracranial aneurysms (IAs). OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of using deep neural networks (DNNs) and API to predict IA occlusion using pre- and post-intervention DSAs. METHODS We analyzed DSA images of IAs pre- and post-treatment to extract API parameters in the IA dome and the corresponding main artery (un-normalized data). We implemented a two-step correction to account for injection variability (normalized data) and projection foreshortening (relative data). A DNN was trained to predict a binary IA occlusion outcome: occluded/unoccluded. Network performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and classification accuracy. To evaluate the effect of the proposed corrections, prediction accuracy analysis was performed after each normalization step. RESULTS The study included 190 IAs. The mean and median duration between treatment and follow-up was 9.8 and 8.0 months, respectively. For the un-normalized, normalized, and relative subgroups, the DNN average prediction accuracies for IA occlusion were 62.5% (95% CI 60.5% to 64.4%), 70.8% (95% CI 68.2% to 73.4%), and 77.9% (95% CI 76.2% to 79.6%). The average AUROCs for the same subgroups were 0.48 (0.44-0.52), 0.67 (0.61-0.73), and 0.77 (0.74-0.80). CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated the feasibility of using API and DNNs to predict IA occlusion using only pre- and post-intervention angiographic information.

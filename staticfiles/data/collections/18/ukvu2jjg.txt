Bochdalek hernia (BH) is a congenital defect of the diaphragm that usually presents in the neonatal period with life threatening cardiorespiratory distress. It is rare for BH to remain silent until adulthood. A 51-year-old woman presented with progressive dyspnea and abdominal symptoms, but without a history of trauma. The diagnosis of BH was made based on chest X-ray and CT. The hernia was repaired by the laparoscopic technique, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. This report validates the feasibility of laparoscopic repair of BH in an adult, which should be within the capability of an advanced laparoscopic surgeon.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Aperio thrombectomy device (Aperio) is a stent retriever designed to achieve rapid and substantial flow restoration in acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusions (LVOs). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the Aperio device and compared it with published data of established stent retrievers. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed institutional data of consecutive stroke procedures in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation that were treated between January 2017 and December 2017 with the Aperio. Reperfusion rate regarding to the extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale (eTICI), procedural times, early clinical outcome, and complications were documented. RESULTS Eighty-two patients were treated by using the Aperio in LVO in the anterior circulation. Median age was 77 (± 12) years (w = 59.8%). Median Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14. Fifty-three (64.6%) patients received intravenous thrombolysis. Successful recanalization (eTICI≥2b) was achieved in 85.3%. Mean time from groin puncture to final recanalization was 52.3 ± 34.8 min. Embolization to new territories occurred in one case. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h was observed in six patients (7.3%). Twenty-eight (41.2%) out of 68 patients available for assessment of functional outcome at 3 months achieved favorable outcome (mRS 0-2). CONCLUSION The Aperio stent retriever mechanical thrombectomy device demonstrated high rates of successful reperfusion and a good safety profile in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to LVO in the anterior circulation.

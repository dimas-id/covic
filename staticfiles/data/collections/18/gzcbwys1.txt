The origin and early spread of 2019-nCoV is studied by phylogenetic analysis using IC-PIC alignment-free method based on DNA/RNA sequence information correlation (IC) and partial information correlation (PIC). The topology of phylogenetic tree of Betacoronavirus is remarkably consistent with biologist's systematics, classifies 2019-nCoV as Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus and supports the assumption that these novel viruses are of bat origin with pangolin as one of the possible intermediate hosts. The novel virus branch of phylogenetic tree shows location-virus linkage. The placement of root of the early 2019-nCoV tree is studied carefully in Neighbor Joining consensus algorithm by introducing different out-groups (Bat-related coronaviruses, Pangolin coronaviruses and HIV viruses etc.) and comparing with UPGMA consensus trees. Several oldest branches (lineages) of the 2019-nCoV tree are deduced that means the COVID-19 may begin to spread in several regions in the world before its outbreak in Wuhan.

Abstract The sudden release of airborne hazardous contaminants in an indoor environment can potentially lead to severe disasters, such as the spread of toxic gases, fire, and explosion. To prevent and mitigate these disasters it is critical to rapidly and accurately identify the characteristics of the contaminant sources. Although remarkable achievements have been made in identifying a single indoor contaminant source in recent years, the issues related to multiple contaminant sources are still challenging. This study presents a method for identifying the exact locations, emission rates, and release time of multiple indoor contaminant sources simultaneously released at constant rates, by considering sensor thresholds and measurement errors. The method uses a two-stage procedure for rapid source identification. Before the release of contaminants, only a limited number of time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations need to be conducted. After the release of contaminants, the method can be executed in real-time. Through case studies in a three-dimensional office the method was numerically demonstrated and validated, and the results show that the method is effective and feasible. The effects of sensor threshold, measurement error and total sampling time on the source identification performance were analysed, and the limitations and applicability of the method were also discussed.

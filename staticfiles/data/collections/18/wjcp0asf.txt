This chapter reviews ribosomal frameshifting with an emphasis on the frameshifting process in astroviruses. Frameshifting is a potential antiviral target. It is possible that the replication cycle of any virus that uses this process could be disrupted by modulation of frameshift efficiencies, but a better understanding of the occurrence and the molecular basis of frameshifting will be required before it can be considered a genuine target. To date, there are no confirmed examples of frameshift signals from conventional eukaryotic cellular genes, although computer-assisted database searches have identified a number of candidates. The frameshift allows the required ratio of viral proteins to be produced, but it may also serve to downregulate levels of viral replicases that may be toxic in high amounts.

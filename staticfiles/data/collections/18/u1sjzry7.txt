The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been developing rapidly since the outbreak of Wuhan in December 2019. It has spread to many regions in the world in the short term, which has attracted wide attention at home and abroad. With the active intervention of traditional medicine, the epidemic situation has been effectively controlled, especially for the treatment of severe and critical patients, which shows its unique advantages. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, ethnic medical practitioners have made suggestions on the understanding and prevention measures of COVID-19 based on the theory of ethnic medicine. We should optimize the individual internal environment of patients with individualized traditional medicine prescription, combine the environmental factors such as the soil and space for the emergence and spread of the disease, and contribute our own strength to fighting against the epidemic as soon as possible and ensure the life and health of the minority people. It was suggested to set up a project to excavate, sort out, research and develop the preparations of medical institutions for the prevention and treatment of “pestilence” by national medicine, and make sufficient preparations for the prevention and treatment of “pestilence” caused by various viruses that may occur frequently, so as to protect human health.

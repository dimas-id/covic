Purpose: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways are increasingly implemented. Goal directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is a core component of ERAS pathways that limit excessive volume administration and is associated with increased use of intraoperative vasopressors. Vasopressor effects on anastomotic healing and pancreatic fistula are inconclusive. We hypothesized that intraoperative vasopressor use in an ERAS GDFT algorithm would not increase risk of pancreatic fistulas. Methods: We reviewed all adult patients undergoing pancreatectomy at an academic institution from January 2013 to February 2016, before and after implementation of an ERAS pathway in July 2014. Retrospective chart review was performed. Log-binomial regression, weighted by stabilized inverse probability-of-treatment weights, estimated effect of ERAS and intraoperative vasopressors on fistula risk. Results: One hundred thirty two patients met inclusion criteria: 74 (56.1%) in the ERAS cohort. No significant differences in overall leak risk (risk ratio [RR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-2.09) were observed between the ERAS and pre-ERAS cohorts. Similarly, vasopressor infusions, independent of ERAS pathway, did not significantly increase the risk of anastomotic leaks (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.52-2.72). Conclusions: Increased use of vasopressor infusions as part of an ERAS pathway for pancreatic surgery is not associated with an increase in the risk of clinically significant pancreatic fistulas.

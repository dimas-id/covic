Surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586–3.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235–2.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.

Destruction of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or natural killer (NK) cells requires the coordinated action of the pore forming protein perforin (Pfp) and the granzyme (Gzm) family of serine proteases. The activation of a number of serine proteases, including GzmA and B, is predominately mediated by cathepsin C (CatC). Deficiencies in CatC‐null mice were therefore expected to replicate the defects observed in GzmAB‐deficient mice. We have previously determined that GzmAB‐deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Here, we have compared the ability of CatC(−/−) mice to control MCMV infection with that of GzmAB‐deficient animals. We found that CatC(−/−) mice have organ‐specific defects in the ability to control MCMV replication, a phenotype that is distinct to that observed in GzmAB(−/−) mice. Significantly, the cytolytic function of CatC‐deficient NK cells and CTLs elicited during infection was indistinguishable from that of wild‐type cells. Hence, CatC is involved in limiting MCMV replication; however, this effect is independent of its role in promoting effector cytolytic activity. These data provide evidence for a novel and unexpected role of CatC during viral infection.

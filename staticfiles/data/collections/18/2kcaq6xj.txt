OBJECTIVE High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear chromatin protein. Furthermore, it induces chemotaxis and inflammation once released in the extracellular milieu, and it has been reported to upregulate, but also to inhibit HIV-1 replication in different cell types. We here investigated the potential role of extracellular HMGB1 in both R5 and X4 HIV-1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and U937 promonocytic cells, respectively. DESIGN MDM or U937 cells were infected with R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains, respectively, in the presence or absence of endotoxin-free recombinant (r) HMGB1 or necrotic cell supernatants either containing or depleted of endogenous HMGB1. METHODS HIV replication was measured by means of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatants and cell-associated viral protein expression. Cytokine and chemokine production were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; cell surface expression of CD4, CC chemokine receptor 5, receptor for advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptor-2 and Toll-like receptor-4 were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Both rHMGB1 and necrotic cell supernatant-associated HMGB1 inhibited replication of R5 HIV-1 in MDM. Surprisingly enough, no upregulation of CC chemokine receptor 5-binding chemokines or of other chemokines and cytokines was observed in rHMGB1-stimulated MDM. HMGB1 also induced chemotaxis and strongly inhibited the replication of X4 HIV-1 in the 'Minus' subset of U937 cell clones expressing high levels of putative HMGB1 receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptors 2 and 4). CONCLUSION Extracellular HMGB1 is a potent inhibitor of both R5 and X4 HIV-1 replication in mononuclear phagocytic cells without inducing the release of HIV-Modulatory chemokines or cytokines.

Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the need to re-think the delivery of services to patients with chronic dysimmune neuropathies. Telephone/video consultations have become widespread but have compounded concerns about objective evaluation. Therapeutic decisions need, more than ever before, to be considered in the best interests of both patients, and society, while not denying function-preserving/restoring treatment. Immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange, for those treated outside of the home, expose patients to the hazards of hospital or outpatient infusion centers. Steroid therapy initiation and continuation pose increased infectious risk. Immunosuppressant therapy similarly becomes highly problematic, with the risks of treatment continuation enhanced by uncertainties regarding duration of the pandemic. The required processes necessitate considerable time and effort especially as resources and staff are re-deployed to face the pandemic, but are essential for protecting this group of patients and as an integral part of wider public health actions.

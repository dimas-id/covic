BACKGROUND Aneurysm recanalization remains a limitation of endovascular treatment. A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.

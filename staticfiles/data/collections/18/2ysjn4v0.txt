Infectious diseases are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. With new pathogens continuously emerging, known infectious diseases reemerging, increasing microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents, global environmental change, ease of world travel, and an increasing immunosuppressed population, recognition of infectious diseases plays an ever-important role in surgical pathology. This becomes particularly significant in cases where infectious disease is not suspected clinically and the initial diagnostic workup fails to include samples for culture. As such, it is not uncommon that a lung biopsy becomes the only material available in the diagnostic process of an infectious disease. Once the infectious nature of the pathological process is established, careful search for the causative agent is advised. This can often be achieved by examination of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections alone as many organisms or their cytopathic effects are visible on routine staining. However, ancillary studies such as histochemical stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or molecular techniques may be needed to identify the organism in tissue sections or for further characterization, such as speciation.

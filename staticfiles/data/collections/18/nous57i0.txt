Introduction: Pyrazolines are well-known and important nitrogen-containing five-membered ring heterocyclic compounds. Various methods have been worked out for their synthesis. Several pyrazoline derivatives have been found to possess diverse biological properties, which has stimulated research activity in this field. Areas covered: The present review sheds light on the recent therapeutic patent literature (2000 – 2011) describing the applications of pyrazolines and their derivatives on selected activities. Many of the therapeutic applications of pyrazoline derivatives have been discussed, either in the patent or in the general literature areas in this review. In addition to selected biological data, a wide range of pharmaceutical applications and pharmaceutical compositions are also summarized. Expert opinion: Pyrazoline derivatives have numerous prominent pharmacological effects, such as antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal, antiamoebic, antimycobacterial), anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidepressant and anticancer. Further pharmacological effects include cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists, antiepileptic, antitrypanosomal, antiviral activity, MAO-inhibitory, antinociceptive activity, insecticidal, hypotensive, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, antioxidant, steroidal and antidiabetic. Lastly, they also effect ACAT inhibition, urotensin II and somatostatin-5 receptors, TGF-β signal transduction inhibitors and neurocytotoxicity inhibitors activities. Many new pyrazoline derivatives have been synthesized and patented, but there are still new aspects to explore and work on.

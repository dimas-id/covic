Immunoparalysis, characterised by impairments in neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage function, is common in critically ill patients. The theoretical ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to improve the functions of both neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages provides a rationale for G-CSF therapy in non-neutropenic critically ill patients with infection or a high risk of nosocomial infection. The expression of the receptors that mediate G-CSF effects in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages is regulated by bacterial products, cytokines and endogenous G-CSF levels, accounting for the variables effects of G-CSF on the neutrophil functions of critically ill patients. This variability should be taken into account when designing studies on the use of G-CSF in ICU-patients. Studies are still needed to identify the subset of patients who may benefit from G-CSF therapy.

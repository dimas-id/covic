Epidemiologic and etiologic data about diarrhea in foals were collected under a planned prospective recording and monitoring study. The survey and monitoring procedures included a survey to obtain an overview of current horse management practices on participating farms, a daily health record survey to obtain information on mares and their foals, and collection of feces from 19 of 144 diarrheic foals and 10 age-matched nondiarrheic foals for electron microscopy, ELISA for rotavirus, and bacteriologic culture. Coronavirus was detected in the feces of diarrheic as well as clinically normal foals. Rotavirus was detected in the feces of diarrheic foals only. With regard to agents found in the feces, there was no significant (P less than 0.05) difference between diarrheic and nondiarrheic foals. Half of the 297 foals on which data were available developed diarrhea. Most foals that developed diarrhea lacked other clinical manifestations of disease. Basic cleanliness at foaling was associated with a lower percentage of foals developing diarrhea. Prophylactic use of antibiotics and vitamins in newborn foals was associated with a higher percentage of foals developing diarrhea. A higher percentage of foals born to visiting mares developed diarrhea, compared with foals born to resident mares.

Feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs) are classified into type I and type II serogroups. Here, we report that feline aminopeptidase N (APN), a cell-surface metalloprotease on the intestinal, lung and kidney epithelial cells, is a receptor for type II FIPV but not for type I FIPV. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) R-G-4, which blocks infection of Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells by type II FIPV, was obtained by immunizing mice with fcwf-4 cells which are highly susceptible to FIPV. This MAb also blocked infection of fcwf-4 cells by type II feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). On the other hand, it did not block infection by type I FIPVs. MAb R-G-4 recognized a polypeptide of relative molecular mass 120â€“130 kDa in feline intestinal brush-border membrane (BBM) proteins. The polypeptide possessed aminopeptidase activity, and the first 15 N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to that of the feline APN. Feline intestinal BBM proteins and the polypeptide reacted with MAb R-G-4 (feline APN) inhibited the infectivity of type II FIPV, type II FECV, CCV and TGEV to fcwf-4 cells, but did not inhibit the infectivity of type I FIPVs.

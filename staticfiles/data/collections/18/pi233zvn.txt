BACKGROUND Patients who are categorized with class I obesity have a body mass index (BMI) of 30-34.99 kg/m(2). This population of patients has a predisposition to diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the improvements of these co-morbidities in a class I obese population that had undergone a bariatric procedure. METHODS After internal review board approval and with adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines, a retrospective review was performed of a prospectively maintained database of 42 class I obese patients who underwent a bariatric procedure at our institution during a 10-year period, from February 2000 to May 2010. The fasting glucose level, glycosylated hemoglobin level, lipid profile, initial weight, and BMI were measured in the preoperative and postoperative periods. RESULTS Our patient population consisted of 30 women and 12 men, with a preoperative mean BMI of 33.9 kg/m(2). Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in 24 patients (57%), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 8 (19%), and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in 10 (24%). Of these 42 patients, 25 (60%) had type 2 diabetes, 1 patient was glucose intolerant, 27 (64%) had arterial hypertension, 25 (60%) had dyslipidemia, 17 (40%) had sleep apnea, and 8 (19%) had osteoarthritis. The postoperative findings included a mean BMI of 26.5 kg/m(2) and a mean weight loss of 41.4 lb. Of the 25 diabetic patients, 5 (20%) gained remission and 12 (48%) improvement of their diabetic status. The single patient with glucose intolerance showed improvement. Of the 27 patients with arterial hypertension, 9 (33%) showed remission and 13 (52%) improvement. Dyslipidemia resolved in 5 patients (20%) and improved in 13 (52%). Obstructive sleep apnea resolved in 10 (59%) and improvement was seen in 1 patient (6%). Finally, osteoarthritis resolved in 1 patient (12%) and improved in 5 (63%). CONCLUSION Bariatric surgery can significantly improve or resolve co-morbid metabolic conditions in patients with class I obesity.

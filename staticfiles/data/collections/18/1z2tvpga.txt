Respiration and gas exchange require coordination between the chest wall, lungs, central nervous system, and pulmonary circulation. A disruption within any one of these systems or a change in the relationship between systems can result in impairments of ventilation, perfusion, or gas exchange. These disruptions can result in debilitating acute and chronic respiratory disorders. This chapter discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, management, and notable public health implications of respiratory system disorders not addressed in prior chapters. Topic areas covered include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary hypertension, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, atelectasis, and pulmonary sarcoidosis.

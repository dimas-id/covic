Cell surface macromolecules play a crucial role in the biology and pathobiology of flaviviruses, both as receptors for virus entry and as signaling molecules for cell–cell interactions in the processes of vascular permeability and inflammation. This review examines the cell tropism and pathogenesis of flaviviruses from the standpoint of cell surface molecules, which have been implicated as receptors in both virus–cell as well as cell–cell interactions. The emerging picture is one that encompasses extensive regulation and interplay among the invading virus, viral immune complexes, Fc receptors, major histocompatibility complex antigens, and adhesion molecules.

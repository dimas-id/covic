Current systemic therapies help to improve the symptoms and quality of life for patients with severe life-threatening rheumatic diseases but provide no curative treatment. For the past two decades, preclinical and clinical studies of stem cell transplantation (SCT) have demonstrated tremendous therapeutic potential for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Herein, the current advances on stem cell therapies, both in animal models and clinical studies, are discussed, with particular attention on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite extensive research and promising data, our knowledge on mechanisms of action for SCT, its administration route and timing, the optimal dose of cells, the cellsâ€™ fate and distribution in vivo, and the safety and efficacy of the treatments remains limited. Further research on stem cell biology is required to ensure that therapeutic safety and efficacy, as observed in animal models, can be successfully translated in clinical trials. Current understanding, limitations, and future directions for SCT with respect to rheumatic diseases are also discussed.

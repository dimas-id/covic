INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a substantial threat to the health of healthcare personnel on the front line of caring for COVID-19 patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services previously announced that all non-essential planned surgeries and procedures should be postponed until further notice and only urgent procedures should proceed. METHODS We share our experiences with safely performing neurosurgical procedures on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients, to aide other neurosurgical teams in preparing for these high-risk cases, especially for neurosurgical interventions which are essential at saving a life or preserving functioning of the central nervous system that cannot be delayed. Perioperative and intraoperative strategies, considerations, as well as challenges arisen under the specific circumstance have been discussed: the hospital should be equipped with negative pressure areas and multiple areas to quarantine positive patients; the operating rooms should be negative pressure or have HEPA-filtration systems in place; all healthcare personnel who immediately participate in neurosurgical interventions for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients should take airborne precautions and wear enhanced personal protective equipment. RESULTS Successful management of neurosurgical emergencies without healthcare personnel infection has been achieved during this pandemic crisis. CONCLUSION Following the proposed guidance, urgent neurosurgical surgeries and procedures can be safely performed for the benefit of critical patients with or suspected for COVID-19.

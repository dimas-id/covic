There is a current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), with a global spread. With the rapid increase in the number of infections, an increase is observed in the number of children with COVID‐19. Most research findings are regarding adult cases, which are not always transferrable to children. Evidence‐based studies are still expected to formulate clinical decisions for pediatric patients. In this review, we included 2597 pediatric patients that reported recently and evaluated the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID‐19. We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults; it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to occur in pediatric patients. Our analysis may contribute to determine the spectrum of disease in children and to develop strategies to control the disease transmission.

Solid organ transplantation (SOT) following haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a rare event. Uncertainty exists whether such recipients are at higher risk of relapse of underlying haematological disease or at increased risk of developing infectious or immunological complications and malignancies following SOT. The experience at our referral organ transplantation center and the present literature of SOT (n = 198) in recipients following previous HCT was systematically reviewed. Outcome analysis of 206 SOT recipients following HCT challenges the validity of the frequently stated comparable outcome with recipients without prior HCT. SOT recipients after HCT are younger and have a higher mortality and morbidity in comparison with “standard” recipients. Rejection rates for SOT recipients following HCT appear to be lower for all organs, except for liver transplantation. In the setting of liver transplantation following HCT, mortality for recipients of deceased donor grafts appears to be exceptionally high, although experience with grafts of living donors are favourable. Morbidity was mostly associated with infectious and malignant complications. Of note some SOT recipients who received solid organ donation from the same HCT donor were able to achieve successful withdrawal of immune suppression. Despite limited follow-up, recipients with prior HCT show a different course after SOT, necessitating attention and closer follow-up.

There is a description of the enzymoimmunologic method (ELISA), which was used for demonstration of rotaviruses and coronaviruses in the samples of excrements of the calves suffering from diarrheas. It is shown by a comparison with the results obtained by electron microscopy that the ELISA method provides by up to 50% higher capture rate and the reaction is highly specific. The method can also be applied to a detection of human rotavirus in the children's stool.

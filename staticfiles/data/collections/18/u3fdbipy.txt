Previous studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV S protein requires proteolytic cleavage by elastase, cathepsin or TMPRSS2 for S-mediated cell-cell or virus-cell membrane fusion. Activation of viral glycoprotein (GP) by protease also has been reported for influenza virus. The most distinctive difference between influenza virus and SARS-CoV is the stage during virus replication in which viral glycoproteins are cleaved by proteases. In influenza virus, the protease makes a simple cut in the GP during maturation. In contrast, SARS-CoV S protein is cleaved by the protease following receptor-induced conformational changes. The protease cleavage site in S protein is thought to be exposed only after receptor binding. In support of this model, we reported that the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2), which is highly similar to the S protein of SARS-CoV, requires two-step conformational changes mediated by sequential receptor binding and proteolysis to be activated for membrane fusion. Such a mechanism allows for tight temporal control over fusion by protecting the activating cleavage site from premature proteolysis yet allowing efficient cleavage upon binding to the receptor on target cells.

Abstract To develop reagents for early diagnosis and therapeutic drugs against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a large (3×109) immunized human antibody library was constructed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six SARS convalescent patients. A single chain variable fragment antibody (N18) with high affinity against N protein of SARS-CoV was isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the VL gene was composed of VL3h (V lambda subgroup) and JL2 regions and the VH gene was composed of VH1-69 (VH1 subgroup), D2-15, D3-22 and JH6 regions. Soluble N18 antibody was expressed in Escherichia coli HB2151, purified by Ni–NTA affinity chromatography and verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The potential application for early diagnosis was evaluated using N protein capture ELISA in which N18 antibody demonstrated high sensitive activity in detecting N protein of SARS-CoV. Finally, the potential usefulness of the N18 antibody in prophylaxis, vaccine design and therapy of SARS is discussed.

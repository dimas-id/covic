Abstract Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is consisting of many practices that are common in East Asia. These practices have been around for more than 2000 years. Many of these methods are becoming increasingly popular in the Western world, where they are classified as alternative or complementary medicine. Most of these techniques are untested and some are even considered dangerous in the modern day world, however, they are sometimes able to help, where modern medicine can not. Therefore, it would be wrong to totally reject them. The SINOPOLL project is a joint R&D effort between Thor Medical Systems LLC and their Chinese partner Shenzhen Anke. Its goal is to combine the vast traditional knowledge in TCM with modern day medical system technology. This paper gives an overview of this research, as well, as proposes several possible solutions for common problems in this field.

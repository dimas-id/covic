A 17-year-old obese male was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after presenting with fluid-responsive septic shock following 7 days of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and neck pain. Initial workup was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and elevated troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed acute myocarditis. One week after discharge, repeat echocardiogram demonstrated improved heart function with only residual myocardial dysfunction.

The use of radionuclide labels allows to study the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies, to control the specificity of their targeting and to monitor the response to an antibody treatment with high accuracy. Selection of label depends on the processing of an antibody after binding to an antigen, and on the character of information to be derived from the study (distribution of antibody in the extracellular space, target occupancy or determination of sites of metabolism). This chapter provides protocols for labelling of antibodies with iodine-125 (suitable also for other radioisotopes of iodine) and with indium-111. Since radiolabelling might damage and reduce the immunoreactive fraction and/or affinity of an antibody, the methods for assessment of these characteristics of an antibody are provided for control.

Stroke is a serious neurological comorbidity observed during the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus associated disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome, corona virus 2) and includes ischemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis. We reviewed factors that could potentially contribute to the occurrence of stroke among patients with COVID-19. There could be an interaction between the conventional risk factors of stroke, infection, systemic inflammatory response and plaque destabilisation. Inflammatory markers, D-dimer elevation and increased cytokine activity have been observed in patients with COVID-19. Other probable contributing factors include cardiac injury leading to embolism, a prothrombotic state and a possibility of direct neuroinvasive potential causing vasculopathy. Data from stroke patients gathered in large multicentric cohorts could help shed more light on the occurrence, behaviour, aetiology, pathophysiology, biomarkers and outcomes of stroke occurring during the ongoing pandemic.

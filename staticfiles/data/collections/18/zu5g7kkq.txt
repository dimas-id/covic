Introduction: Severe sickle cell disease is associated with progressive end-organ damage and early mortality in adults. While allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant from a matched related donor is curative, the vast majority of patients do not have a compatible sibling. Accordingly, platforms using haploidentical donors have been developed, which provide near universal availability. Areas covered: This review focuses on the two commonly used approaches for haploidentical hematopoietic transplants, namely T-cell deplete and T-cell replete, each of which is associated with unique benefits and drawbacks. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate individualized decision making for patients and providers by reviewing the pros- and cons of these differing approaches. Expert opinion: Individuals with sickle cell disease eligible for a hematopoietic cell transplant can be considered based on recent results. Comparable outcomes are seen with T-cell deplete and T-cell replete approaches. The choice depends largely on institutional preference.

The population structure of an embryo-attenuated infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Arkansas (Ark) Delmarva Poultry Industry (DPI)-derived vaccine was characterized during serial passages in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells and after back-passage in embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) and in chickens. Both conventional and deep-sequencing results consistently showed population changes occurred during adaptation to CEK cells. Specifically, 13 amino acid (aa) positions seemed to be targets of selection when comparing the vaccine genome prior to and after seven passages in CEK (CEKp7). Amino acid changes occurred at four positions in the spike (S) gene and, at two positions in the S gene, large shifts in frequencies of aa encoding were observed. CEK adaptation shifted the virus population towards homogeneity in S. The changes achieved in the S1 gene in CEKp7 were maintained after a back-passage in ECE. Outside the S gene, aa changes at three positions and large shifts in frequencies at four positions were observed. Synonymous nucleotide changes and changes in noncoding regions of the genome were observed at eight genome positions. Inoculation of early CEK passages into chickens induced higher antibody levels and CEKp4 induced increased respiratory signs compared to CEKp7. From an applied perspective, the fact that CEK adaptation of embryo-attenuated Ark vaccines reduces population heterogeneity, and that changes do not revert after one replication cycle in ECE or in chickens, provides an opportunity to improve commercial ArkDPI-derived vaccines.

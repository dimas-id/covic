BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a totally stapled gastrojejunal anastomosis performed using one transabdominal 12-mm trocar and a gastroscope in a porcine model. METHODS The procedure was carried out on six domestic pigs weighing 45 kg using a hybrid technique with a gastroscope and a 12-mm Hasson trocar, positioned in the left hypochondrium. At the end of the procedure a mechanical circular 21-mm gastrojejunal anastomosis was performed by inserting the stapler through a small gastrotomy after enlarging the trocar incision. RESULTS In all six cases the procedure was completed through a single 3 cm abdominal incision and without complications. The mean operating time was 2 h, and endoscopic investigation showed that the anastomoses were intact, patent, and airtight. CONCLUSIONS Totally stapled gastrojejunal anastomosis using a hybrid NOTES-single 12-mm trocar approach is a feasible procedure in the porcine model. Further survival studies are warranted, particularly to evaluate the functional results of this procedure.

The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), the only New World rodent used commonly in research, has contributed to studies of anaphylaxis, asthma, gnotobiotics, immunology, infectious and nutritional disease, and otology, among others. Several outbred and inbred strains were used historically, but at present, only outbred pigmented stocks, albino Hartley stocks, and IAF hairless stock are available commercially in the United States (Fig. 6.1). Husbandry considerations include noninjurious housing, appropriate food, prevention of intraspecies aggression, environmental stability, and reproductive aspects, including a long gestation. Although guinea pigs are susceptible to a wide range of diseases, current breeding and housing conditions have reduced the occurrence of many spontaneous infectious diseases in these animals. Diseases of concern that do occur in research colonies include respiratory diseases (especially those caused by Bordetella, Streptococcus, and adenovirus), chlamydiosis, pediculosis, dermatophytosis, hypovitaminosis C, pregnancy toxemia, urolithiasis, traumatic lesions, dental malocclusion, ovarian cysts, and antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis.

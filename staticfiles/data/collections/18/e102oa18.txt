Biomarkers are used ubiquitously as indicators of biological health. The development of genomic and proteomic multiplex technologies have enormously amplified biomarker discovery and application to diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in clinical practice. New technologies are now available that simultaneously identify a wide spectrum of biomarkers and save time and costs. Multiplexed assays can be coupled to other disease specific indicators (i.e., cytokines, single nucleotide polymorphisms) in order to get more powerful information. However, there is an urgent need for validation/standardization of the new assays before they are adopted into clinical diagnostics. It is worthy to note a new assay, T cell interferon gamma release (TIGRAs), which has recently been introduced in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection. It seems to perform better than tuberculin skin test in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In this review, we focus on advantages and limits of novel approaches to the detection of autoantibody profiles in autoimmune diseases or pathogen signatures in microbiology.

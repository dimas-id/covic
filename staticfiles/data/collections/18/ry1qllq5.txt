The COVID-19 pandemic has placed competing demands on many graduate students working at practica. Though graduate programs seek to minimize potential sources of exposure to the virus, some practicum sites rely on students as essential staff. At the same time, although some students may wish to eliminate this source of potential exposure to the virus, other students may consider the opportunity to fulfill their practicum duties at a time of crisis an important part of their educational experience.

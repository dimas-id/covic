OBJECTIVE Antegrade cerebral perfusion during aortic arch surgery plays an important role in improving postoperative neurological outcomes. We report our experience using innominate artery cannulation for arterial perfusion during aortic arch surgery. METHODS From January 2008 to December 2015, 159 patients underwent aortic arch surgery using innominate artery perfusion and were included in the study analysis (mean age, 71.4 Â± 9.1 years; male, 120). RESULTS Total arch replacement was performed in 84.1% of all patients. The incidence of postoperative stroke was 2.5%, with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS Innominate artery perfusionis a safe and useful technique for aortic arch surgery.

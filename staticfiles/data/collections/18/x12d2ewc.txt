In pathogen recognition by C-type lectins, several levels of complexity can be distinguished; these might modulate the immune response in different ways. Firstly, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern repertoire expressed at the microbial surface determines the interactions with specific receptors (Fig. 42.1). Secondly, each immune cell type possesses a specific set of pathogen-recognition receptors. Thirdly, changes in the cell-surface distribution of C-type lectins regulate carbohydrate binding by modulating receptor affinity for different ligands. Crosstalk between these receptors results in a network of multimolecular complexes, adding a further level of complexity in pathogen recognition (Cambi and Figdor 2005; Thiel et al. 2006) (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065-2_23). MBL deficiency is genetically determined and predisposes to recurrent infections and chronic inflammatory diseases. MBL deficiency has been implicated in susceptibility and course of viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infection. More than 10% of the general population may, depending on definition, be classified as MBL deficient, underlining the redundancy of the immune system. MBL-disease association studies have been a fruitful area of research, which implicates a role for MBL in infective, inflammatory and autoimmune disease processes. MBL deficiency predisposes both to infection by extra-cellular pathogens and to autoimmune disease.

Recently we characterized the mono(ADP-ribosyl) hydrolase (MAR hydrolase) activity of the macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3(MD)) of chikungunya virus. Using recombinant viruses with targeted mutations in the macrodomain, we demonstrated that hydrolase function is important for viral replication in cultured neuronal cells and for neurovirulence in mice. Here, we describe the general cell culture and animal model infection protocols for alphaviruses and the technical details for biochemical characterization of the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3(MD) mutants and the preparation of recombinant viruses incorporating those mutations through site-directed mutagenesis of an infectious cDNA virus clone.

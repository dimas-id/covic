We previously presented the protein-protein interaction network - the ‘HoP’ or the host protein interactome - of 332 host proteins that were identified to interact with 27 nCoV19 viral proteins by Gordon et al. Here, we studied drugs targeting the proteins in this interactome to identify whether any of them may potentially be repurposable against SARS-CoV-2. We studied each of the drugs using the BaseSpace Correlation Engine and identified those that induce gene expression profiles negatively correlated with SARS-associated expression profile. This analysis resulted in 20 drugs whose differential gene expression (drug versus normal) had an anti-correlation with differential expression for SARS (viral infection versus normal). These included drugs that were already being tested for their clinical activity against SARS-CoV-2, those with proven activity against SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and those identified/prioritized by other computational re-purposing studies. In summary, our integrated computational analysis of the HoP interactome in conjunction with drug-induced transcriptomic data resulted in drugs that may be repurposable for COVID-19.

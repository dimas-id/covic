Infrasternal mediastinoscopic single-incision surgery is a minimally invasive surgical option for patients with anterior mediastinal lesions. The main drawback of the procedure is difficult when handling the endoscopic instruments through the small infrasternal incision. Herein, we report our initial experience with use of the procedure in 2 patients with bronchogenic cysts in the anterior mediastinum. We found that use of an SILS Port, now widely available for single-incision laparoscopic surgery, can decrease the difficulty of this approach.

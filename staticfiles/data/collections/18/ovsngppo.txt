Considering recent HIV vaccine failures, the authors believe that it would be most important to find new targets for vaccine-induced immunity, and to analyze the data from previous trials, using an innovative approach. In their review article, the authors briefly summarize the significance of the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection in different viral diseases and discuss role of these types of antibodies as the obstacles for vaccine development. Findings which indicate that complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (C-ADE) is present also in HIV-infected patients, are summarized. Previous results of the authors, suggesting that C-ADE plays a very important role in the progression of HIV infection are described. Data reflecting that enhancing antibodies may develop even in vaccinated animals and human volunteers, and may be responsible for the paradoxical results obtained in some subgroups of vaccinees are discussed. Finally, based on their hypothesis, the authors offer some suggestions for the future development of vaccines.

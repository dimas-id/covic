PROBLEM: The COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving crisis with widespread impact upon our medical system, including senior trainee travel for fellowship interviews. Numerous institutions have conscientiously deferred in-person interviews or virtual formats. Given the competitive nature of fellowship interviews, candidates may express concern that they are at a disadvantage in engaging in online meetings versus live, on-site interviews, and similarly may feel ill prepared to perform optimally during online interviews. APPROACH: We draw upon our experience with online interview platforms in this guide for fellowship candidates who are rapidly adapting to new technology and styles associated with videoconference interviews so that they can best promote themselves for competitive positions.

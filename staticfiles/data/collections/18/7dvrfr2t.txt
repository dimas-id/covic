Radiologic imaging techniques, such as F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (FDG PET/CT), provide diagnostic value in a variety of diseases. In cases of suspected infection, FDG PET/CT can find areas of fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism, correlating with local acute inflammation. The following case involves a man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who presented with symptoms of infection and positive blood cultures with high suspicion of arteriovenous fistula as the source of infection. The patient also had two central lines that could be a site of infection. Concerns for patientâ€™s persistent positive blood cultures necessitated FDG PET/CT to confirm site of infection. Confirming active infection and the source of infection guides therapeutic measures and eliminates concern for other disease etiologies common in patients with ESRD.

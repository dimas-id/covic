In this chapter, an overview of the basic principles of fused deposition modelling, commonly known as 3D printing technology, is presented. The chapter begins by introducing the holistic concept of additive manufacturing and its scientific principle as the technology for the modern and future industry. Then, the science of 3D printing is described. The applications of FDM in various fields are also highlighted with a focus on an interesting role the 3D printing technology is playing in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. The chapter also gives a highlight of the parameters involved in fused deposition modelling of polymers and their basic interaction with the properties of the manufactured components. In relation to the process parameters, quality aspects of FDM products have also been briefly described in the chapter.

Objective Studies have suggested that the lymph node yield and lymph node density from selective or elective neck dissections are predictive of patient outcomes and may be used for patient counseling, treatment planning, or quality measurement. Our objective was to systematically review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis of studies that investigated the prognostic significance of lymph node yield and/or lymph node density after neck dissection for patients with head and neck cancer. Data Sources The Ovid/Medline, Ovid/Embase, and NLM PubMed databases were systematically searched on January 23, 2017, for articles published between January 1, 1946, and January 23, 2017. Review Methods We reviewed English-language original research that included survival analysis of patients undergoing neck dissection for a head and neck malignancy stratified by lymph node yield and/or lymph node density. Study data were extracted by 2 independent researchers (S.C. and M.O.). We utilized the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to account for heterogeneity of studies. Results Our search yielded 350 nonduplicate articles, with 23 studies included in the final synthesis. Pooled results demonstrated that increased lymph node yield was associated with a significant improvement in survival (hazard ratio, 0.833; 95% CI, 0.790-0.879). Additionally, we found that increased lymph node density was associated with poorer survival (hazard ratio, 1.916; 95% CI, 1.637-2.241). Conclusions Increased nodal yield portends improved outcomes and may be a valuable quality indicator for neck dissections, while increased lymph node density is associated with diminished survival and may be used for postsurgical counseling and planning for adjuvant therapy.

ABSTRACT: A series of new β-isatin aldehyde-N,N′-thiocarbohydrazone, bis-β-isatin thiocarbohydrazones, bis-β-isatin carbohydrazones was synthesized by condensation of 5-substituted isatin with thiocarbohydrazide or carbohydrazide. The chemical structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for in vitro antiviral activity against various strains of DNA and RNA viruses, but exhibited moderate antiviral activity compared with the reference compounds. Among all the compounds 6c exhibited the highest chemoprevention activity in a two-stage mouse-skin carcinogenesis test. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]

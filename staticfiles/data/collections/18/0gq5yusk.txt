Objective Previous study indicated that bladder cells which express ACE2 were a potential infection route of 2019-nCov. This study observed some differences of bladder cell cluster and their ACE2 expression between OAB mice and healthy mice, indicating the change of infectious possibility and pathway under overactive bladder (OAB) circumstance. Material and method Pubic dataset acquisition was used to get ACE2 expression in normal human bladder and mice bladder (GSE129845). We built up over OAB model and studied the impact on cell typing and ACE2 expression. By way of using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique, bladder cell clustering and ACE2 expression in various cell types were measured respectively. Result In pubic database (healthy human and mice bladder), ACE2 expression in humans and mice is concentrated in bladder epithelial cells. The disappearance of umbrella cells, a component of bladder epithelial, was found in our OAB model. In the two mouse bladder samples, ACE2 expression of epithelial cells is 34.1%, also the highest of all cell types. Conclusion The disappearance of umbrella cell may alternate the infection pathway of 2019-nCov and relate to the onset and progression of OAB.

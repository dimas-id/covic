In the information age, one of the main research field that is being developed is the one related to how to improve the quality of the search engine as regards knowing how to manage the information contained in a document in order to extract its content and interpret it. On the one hand due to the heterogeneity of the information contained on the web (text, image, video, musical scores), and on the other hand to satisfy the user who generally searches for information of a very different type. This paper describes the development and evaluation of an analytical method for the analysis of musical score considered in its symbolic level. The developed method is based on the analysis of the fundamental elements of the musical grammar and takes into account the distance between the sounds (which characterize a melody) and their duration (which makes the melody active and alive). The method has been tested on a set of different musical scores, realizing an algorithm in order to identity a musical score in a database.

It is generally expected that in developing countries the epidemiological transition, with improved health and lower mortality rates, will eventually lead to a demographic transition with lower fertility rates. The reductions in mortality characterising the epidemiological transition are often associated with controlling the infectious diseases within populations, which leaves the chronic diseases associated with old age, cancer and heart disease dominating the causes of death. However, if the demographic transition does not occur quickly, populations can grow rapidly, creating an increased potential for spread of infectious disease. These infectious diseases could, in turn, increase death rates amongst young people and reverse the epidemiological transition. The relationship between population growth, size and infection depends upon the changes in contact pattern associated with there being more people. If facilities can keep pace with growth, then the increase in contact rates can be kept to a minimum, and the potential reversal in the epidemic transition prevented. This makes development a crucial adjunct to population growth if the global community is not to be increasingly exposed to pandemics of infectious disease. Here we review the epidemiological and demographic theory which relates population growth and infectious disease.

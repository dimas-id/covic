Sleep telemedicine practitioners must ensure their practice complies with all applicable institutional, state, and federal regulations. Providers must be licensed in any state in which they provide care, have undergone credentialing and privileging procedures at outside facilities, and avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest while providing that care. Internet-based prescribing remains limited to certain circumstances. Whether or not a malpractice insurance policy covers telemedicine depends on the insurer, especially if interstate care is provided. All telemedicine programs must protect patient health information. Similarly, bioethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice apply to both in-person and telemedicine-based care.

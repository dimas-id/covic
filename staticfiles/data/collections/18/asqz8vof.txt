INTRODUCTION Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a technically challenging procedure in which complications and operative times depend on the operator's expertise as well as on the location and size of the lesion. Good visualization of the submucosal dissection plane is essential to perform a safe and effective ESD. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a novel traction method using an over-the-scope steerable grasper to improve the exposure of the dissection plane during gastric ESD. RESULTS A total of 24 ESDs were performed without any complications in various locations of porcine stomachs, including antrum, gastric body, and cardia. En bloc complete resections were achieved in all cases. The mean specimen size was 44.92 ± 8.30 mm, mean total procedure time was 29.17 ± 11.27 minutes, and mean dissection time was 15.08 ± 7.21 minutes. The optimal dissection plane could be obtained by controlling the grasper in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Technical feasibility, efficacy, and safety of the over-the-scope steerable grasper technique were demonstrated in order to provide dynamic and controlled traction during ESD at different locations of porcine stomachs.

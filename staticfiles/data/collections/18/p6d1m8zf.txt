A 58 year old woman was admitted with symptoms of COVID-19. She subsequently developed mixed shock and echocardiogram showed mid-distal left ventricular hypokinesis and apical ballooning, findings typical for stress, or Takotsubo, cardiomyopathy. Over the next few days her left ventricular function improved, further supporting reversibility of acute stress cardiomyopathy.

Abstract In this study, an abundant (A+U)% and low codon bias were revealed in duck hepatitis virus type 1 (DHV-1) and the new serotype strains isolated from Taiwan, South Korea and Mainland China (DHV-N). The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in these samples. By comparative analysis of the codon usage patterns of 40 ORFs of DHV, we found that all of DHV-1 strains grouped in genotype C; the DHV-N strains isolated in South Korea and China clustered into genotypes B; and the DHV-N strains isolated from Taiwan clustered into genotypes A. The findings revealed that more than one subtype of DHV-1 circulated in East Asia. Furthermore, the results of phylogenetic analyses based on RSCU values and Clustal W method indicated obvious phylogenetic congruities. This suggested that better genome consistency of DHV may exist in nature and phylogenetic analyses based on RSCU values maybe a good method in classifying genotypes of the virus. Our work might give some clues to the features and some evolutionary information of DHV.

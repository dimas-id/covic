Dear editor, We read with great interest the article titled ?Radiological approaches to COVID-19 pneumonia? by Akcay S. et al. in the latest issue of Turk J Med Sci [1]. The authors provided a review of the radiological findings of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. We would like to highlight some missing radiological findings in this article, and we want to contribute to some critical radiological findings.

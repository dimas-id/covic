AIM To express the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in E. coli and construct its DNA vaccine. METHODS The prokaryotic expression vector pQEN containing N gene was constructed and transformed into the E. coli. The recombinant N protein was then expressed and purified by Ni(2+)-NTA affinity resin. In addition, the N gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pSecTagB and the eukaryotic recombinant expression vector pSecN was obtained. The DNA vaccine pSecN was injected to immunize the BALB/c mice to produce the antiserum against N protein of SARS-CoV. Subsequently, the reactivity of the antiserum with recombinant N protein and SARS-CoV particles was assayed by ELISA. RESULTS Recombinant N protein reacted strongly and specifically with the sera from immunized mice and SARS patients. Similarly, the sera of immunized mice could also react specifically with SARS-CoV particles. CONCLUSION The recombinant N protein could be used as a good antigen to detect SARS. The DNA vaccine pSecN could also efficiently induce the production of IgG against N protein of SARS-CoV, which offered clues to the development of a potential DNA vaccine.

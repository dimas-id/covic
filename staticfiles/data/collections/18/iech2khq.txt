Abstract In the setting of the current novel coronavirus pandemic, this document has been generated to provide guiding statements for the adult cardiac surgeon to consider in a rapidly evolving national landscape. Acknowledging the risk for a potentially prolonged need for cardiac surgery procedure deferral, the authors have created this proposed template for physicians and interdisciplinary teams to consider in protecting their patients, institution and their highly specialized cardiac surgery team. In addition, recommendations on the transition from traditional in-person patient assessments and outpatient follow-up are provided. Lastly, we advocate that the cardiac surgeon must continue to serve as leaders, experts, and relevant members of our medical community, shifting our role as necessary in this time of need.

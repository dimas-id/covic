In order to be familiar with the dissection of the esophagus through a single transmediastinal access. Combined single-port transmediastinal and laparoscopic access with CO2 insufflation for esophageal resection were performed in experimental dogs. The esophagus was separated by single-hole mediastinoscopy, the stomach was separated by laparoscopy, and left neck anastomosis of tubular gastroesophagus was performed on the experimental dogs. Combined single-port transmediastinal and laparoscopic access with the CO2 insufflation is an alternative approach for esophagectomy with certain advantages compared to transthoracic approach. Animal models can help the surgeon get familiar with a certain procedure before transmediastinal esophagectomy on a human.

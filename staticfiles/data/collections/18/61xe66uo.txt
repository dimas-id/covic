The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multimodal reperfusion therapy (MMRT) for tandem internal carotid artery and middle cerebral arterial (TIM) occlusions. Cases of TIM occlusion were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The analyzed objects included etiology, sites of tandem occlusion, collateral flow, location and size of infarcts. Combined with mechanical recanalization techniques and its complications, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and imaging data that was derived pre- and post-procedure were further contrasted. The study enrolled six patients with TIM occlusions. The mean NIHSS score on admission was 17 (range 13-20) and the median time from puncture to recanalization was 141 min (range 60-230). The substantial recanalization rate (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3) was 83.3% and no symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was observed. The mean NIHSS score after three days was 14 (range 10-19) and 9 (range 3-17) following discharge. However, one patient died of pulmonary infection one month after discharge. For the five patients who survived, the modified Rankin Scale was evaluated at three months, with scores of 3, 1, 3, 5 and 3, respectively. It is concluded that endovascular therapy for acute TIM occlusions are complex, MMRT may be relatively safe and effective.

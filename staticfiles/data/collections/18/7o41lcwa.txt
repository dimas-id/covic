The emergence of the novel H7N9 influenza A virus (IAV) has caused global concerns about the ability of this virus to spread between humans. Analysis of the receptor-binding properties of this virus using a recombinant protein approach in combination with fetuin-binding, glycan array and human tissue-binding assays demonstrates increased binding of H7 to both α2-6 and α2-8 sialosides as well as reduced binding to α2-3-linked SIAs compared to a closely related avian H7N9 virus from 2008. These differences could be attributed to substitutions Q226L and G186V. Analysis of the enzymatic activity of the neuraminidase N9 protein indicated a reduced sialidase activity, consistent with the reduced binding of H7 to α2-3 sialosides. However, the novel H7N9 virus still preferred binding to α2-3- over α2-6-linked SIAs and was not able to efficiently bind to epithelial cells of human trachea in contrast to seasonal IAV, consistent with its limited human-to-human transmission.

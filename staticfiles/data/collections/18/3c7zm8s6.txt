User Identity Linkage (UIL) is the problem of matching user identities across multiple online social networks (OSNs) which belong to the same person. The solutions to UIL problem facilitate cross-platform research on OSN users and enable many useful applications such as user profiling and recommendation. As the UIL labeled data are often lacking and costly to obtain, learning user embeddings for matching user identities using an unsupervised approach is therefore highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised UIL framework for enhancing existing user embedding-based UIL methods. Our proposed framework incorporates two key ideas, user-discriminative features and retrofitting embedding. The user-discriminative features enable us to differentiate a specific user identity from other users in its OSN. From the user-discriminative features, we derive pairs of similar user identities across OSNs for retrofitting the base user embeddings of existing UIL methods. Through extensive experiments on three real-world OSN datasets, we show that our framework can leverage user-discriminative features to improve the accuracy of different user embedding-based UIL methods significantly. The quantum of improvement can also be surprisingly good even for existing UIL methods with very poor matching accuracy.

Introduction: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has presented health-care systems worldwide with novel challenges and experiences and evidence is emerging during the pandemic. Patients requiring hospitalization frequently suffer from respiratory failure of different severities. Aim: The aim of this guideline is the treatment of patients with SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) in hospital; in particular, it addresses the treatment of respiratory failure treated in general Internal Medical- and Pulmonary Medical wards. Results: Elderly patients and patients with chronic disease are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Target oxygen saturation should be between 92% and 96% in patients without chronic lung diseases. Treatment with &gt;5 L oxygen/min should be in close collaboration with intensive care colleagues and &gt;15 l/min preferably in intensive care units. High-flow nasal canula (HFNC) and long-term Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) are recommended for patients not responding to conventional oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is only recommended for selected patients, such as those with a ceiling of treatment or patients presenting with hypercapnic failure. With the use of humidification protective equipment as FFP2-3 masks should be used. Nebulized medication should be avoided, and spacers should be used instead. Conclusion: Respiratory failure is frequently the cause of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 and should be monitored closely.

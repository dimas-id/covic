When tinnitus is pulse-synchronous, a vascular etiology is suggested. We present a case of persistent and troublesome pulsatile tinnitus caused by a transverse-sigmoid sinus diverticulum that was endovascularly treated with stent-assisted coiling. A 39-yearold woman presented with a 4-year history of progressive pulsatile tinnitus involving the right ear. Slight pulsatile bruit was heard on the right mastoid bone by auscultation. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a diverticulum of the transverse-sigmoid sinus. The procedure was performed with an 8F guiding catheter (Cordis, USA) catheterized into the right sigmoid sinus. The diverticulum was completely coiled following deployment of a 5.5 mm-50 mm Leo stent. This patient awakened without any neurological deficit and with immediate resolution of her tinnitus. This case report describes a stent-assisted coil embolization of venous sinus diverticulum, which provides immediate resolution of pulsatile tinnitus.

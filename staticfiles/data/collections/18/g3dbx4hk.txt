Abstract Individuals are generally content to self-medicate for acute cough. It is only when the cough becomes persistent that they seek medical assistance. It is not known why patients cough in association with an acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), although interest has focused on how viruses may influence airway sensory nerve function and contribute to heightened cough reflex sensitivity. Why some patients develop a persistent cough following a viral URTI is also unclear. Much more is known about the causes and aggravants of chronic cough although there is no broad agreement as to the best way to manage such patients. Asthma, upper gastrointestinal dysfunction and rhinitis are frequently associated with chronic cough, although the impact of cough in suppurative lung disease and interstitial lung fibrosis is rarely considered. The development of effective treatments for cough remains a challenge and will require co-operation between clinicians, scientists and the pharmaceutical industry.

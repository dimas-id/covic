Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multiprotein structures that resemble the conformation of native viruses but lack a viral genome, potentiating their application as safer and cheaper vaccines. The production of VLPs has been strongly linked with the use of insect cells and the baculovirus expression vector system, especially those particles composed of two or more structural viral proteins. In fact, this expression platform has been extensively improved over the years to address the challenges of coexpression of multiple proteins and their proper assembly into complexes in the same cell. In this article, the role of insect cell technology in the development and production of complex VLPs is overviewed; recent achievements, current bottlenecks and future trends are also highlighted.

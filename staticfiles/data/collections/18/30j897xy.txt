BACKGROUND The resection of planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sellae meningiomas is challenging. A universally accepted classification system predicting surgical risk and outcome is still lacking. OBJECTIVES We report a modern surgical technique specific for planum sphenoidale and tuberculum sellae meningiomas with associated outcome. A new classification system that can guide the surgical approach and may predict surgical risk is proposed. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of the patients who between 2005 and March 2015 underwent a craniotomy or endoscopic surgery for the resection of meningiomas involving the suprasellar region. Operative nuances of a modified frontotemporal craniotomy and orbital osteotomy technique for meningioma removal and reconstruction are described. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients were found to have tumors arising mainly from the planum sphenoidale or the tuberculum sellae; 25 underwent frontotemporal craniotomy and tumor removal with orbital osteotomy and bilateral optic canal decompression, and 2 patients underwent endonasal transphenoidal resection. The most common presenting symptom was visual disturbance (77%). Vision improved in 90% of those who presented with visual decline, and there was no permanent visual deterioration. Cerebrospinal fluid leak occurred in one of the 25 cranial cases (4%) and in 1 of 2 transphenoidal cases (50%), and in both cases it resolved with treatment. There was no surgical mortality. CONCLUSION An orbitotomy and early decompression of the involved optic canal are important for achieving gross total resection, maximizing visual improvement, and avoiding recurrence. The visual outcomes were excellent. A new classification system that can allow the comparison of different series and approaches and indicate cases that are more suitable for an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach is presented.

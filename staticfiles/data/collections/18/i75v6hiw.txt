INTRODUCTION: Otolaryngologists are at very high risk of COVID-19 infection while performing examination or surgery. Strict guidelines for these specialists have not already been provided, while currently available recommendations could presumably change in course of COVID-19 pandemic as the new data increases. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to synthesize evidence concerning otolaryngology during COVID-19 pandemic. It presents a review of currently existing guidelines and recommendations concerning otolaryngological procedures and surgeries during COVID-19 pandemic, and provides a collective summary of all crucial information for otolaryngologists. It summarizes data concerning COVID-19 transmission, diagnosis, and clinical presentation highlighting the information significant for otolaryngologists. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without time limit using terms ''COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" in conjunction with "head and neck surgery", "otorhinolaryngological manifestations". RESULTS: Patients in stable condition should be consulted using telemedicine options. Only emergency consultations and procedures should be performed during COVID-19 pandemic. Mucosa-involving otolaryngologic procedures are considered high risk procedures and should be performed using enhanced PPE (N95 respirator and full face shield or powered air-purifying respirator, disposable gloves, surgical cap, gown, shoe covers). Urgent surgeries for which there is not enough time for SARS-CoV-2 screening are also considered high risk procedures. These operations should be performed in a negative pressure operating room with high-efficiency particulate air filtration. Less urgent cases should be tested for COVID-19 twice, 48 h preoperatively in 24 h interval. CONCLUSIONS: This review serves as a collection of current recommendations for otolaryngologists for how to deal with their patients during COVID-19 pandemic.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a neuroinvasive virus that has been used as a model organism for studying common properties of all herpesviruses. HSV induces host organelle rearrangement and forms dispersed assembly compartments in epithelial cells, which complicates the study of HSV assembly. In this study, we show that HSV forms a visually distinct unitary cytoplasmic viral assembly center (cVAC) in both cancerous and primary neuronal cells that concentrates viral structural proteins and is the site of capsid envelopment. The HSV cVAC also concentrates host membranes that are important for viral assembly, such as Golgi- and recycling endosome-derived membranes. Lastly, we show that HSV cVAC formation and/or maintenance depends on an intact microtubule network and a viral tegument protein, pUL51. Our observations suggest that the neuronal cVAC is a uniquely useful model to study common herpesvirus assembly pathways, and cell-specific pathways for membrane reorganization. Summary This study shows that HSV forms a viral assembly center in neuronal cells by reorganization of host membranes. This system is a novel and powerful tool to study herpesvirus assembly pathways and host cell membrane dynamics.

Keio University and Waseda University have worked together on artificial O(2) carrier research for 20 years in close cooperation. Two candidate materials have been selected from the viewpoints of safety, efficacy, and cost performance. One is Hemoglobin-vesicles (HbV) and the other is albumin-heme (rHSA-heme). This chapter summarizes our video presentation that introduced the recent results of our research into HbV and rHSA-heme.

OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 broke out in China at the end of 2019 and spread rapidly around the world. The World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. China has adopted its own country-specific comprehensive prevention and control measures, and, as a result, the domestic COVID-19 epidemic became effectively controlled in China in mid-March 2020. During the COVID-19 epidemic, remarkable changes have taken place in China's domestic learning, living, and working methods, primarily in terms of the synergy between the Internet Plus (Internet+) strategy and the leadership of the Chinese government.

In a matter of mere months, humanity was unexpectedly struck by the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, shifting our perception as medical practitioners regarding our day-to-day activity. One especially disconcerting change was patient addressability to medical facilities, as well as access to proper healthcare in various fields. As these changes occurred rapidly, dermatologists too had to adapt by means of teledermatology, giving us back the ability to reach, treat, and comfort our patients. Among the individuals requiring special dermatological attention are those suffering from psoriasis, especially considering that the biological therapies employed in treating this debilitating disease become questionable in the circumstance of the current pandemic. As more evidence surfaces concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, we become closer to understanding which therapies may interfere with its clearance, and which are actually safe to use. This review aims to answer the question, are biological therapies warranted in the treatment of psoriasis during the COVID-19 outbreak, or should they be discontinued?

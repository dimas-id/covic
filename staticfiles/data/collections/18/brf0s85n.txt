PURPOSE To describe and compare primary patency rates in patients undergoing endovascular femoropopliteal interventions with standard or interwoven nitinol stents or drug-coated balloons. METHODS A cohort of 1292 patients was treated for symptomatic femoropopliteal occlusive disease classified as Rutherford category â‰¥ 1 at a large vascular center between June 2006 and August 2013 using either standard nitinol stents (SNS; n=432), interwoven nitinol stents (INS; n=470), or drug-coated balloons (DCB; n=390). Primary patency rates were assessed by ultrasound or angiographic readings for over 3 years of follow-up. Propensity score-matched pairs were formed to compare each treatment with another using survival analysis. RESULTS Survival curves of primary patency favored INS compared with SNS in 368 propensity score-matched pairs (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 86.6%, 76.4%, and 68.9%, respectively, in the INS group vs 60.5%, 46.1%, and 42.1%, respectively, in the SNS group. No significant difference (p=0.232) was seen for the comparison of SNS vs DCB in 284 matched pairs over long-term follow-up (primary patency estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 79.8%, 53.8%, and 32.9%, respectively, in the DCB group vs 60.5%, 44.8%, and 40.3%, respectively, in the SNS group). Survival curves of primary patency favored INS over DCB in 254 matched pairs (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 79.0%, 51.2%, and 30.1%, respectively, in the DCB group vs 89.0%, 76.9%, and 66.2%, respectively, in the INS group. CONCLUSION Propensity score-based analysis of primary patency suggests profound differences in restenosis rates between various treatment modalities for femoropopliteal disease for over 3 years of follow-up.

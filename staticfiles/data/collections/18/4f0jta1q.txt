Background The prevention of surgical site infection is one of the most concerning issues in operating rooms. Surgical gowns are worn as one of the intraoperative strategies for infection prevention. The present study investigated whether the gowns remained sterile during the surgical procedure. Furthermore, this study examined which parts of the surgical gown were more prone to contamination. Methods The sterility of the gowns was investigated during eight total joint arthroplasties all of which were performed by four surgeons. The samples were taken from the arms and frontal part of the sterile gowns pre- and postoperatively. In the anterior surface of the gown, the sampling was initiated at a strip with 50 cm height from the ground followed by the strips with 15 cm distances from caudal to cephalad. Furthermore, the frontal part of the gown was divided into three parts in relation to the operating room table. Finally, the contamination rate was evaluated in each part. A semiquantitative method was used for the analysis of bacterial culture. Results Before the operation, there were four samples tested positive for bacterial culture (1.06%). All of these samples were taken from the most proximal strip near the neckline. After the surgery, the rate of contamination in the strips on the frontal part of the gown was reported as 3.1% to 53%. Based on the operating table, the contamination rate was 35.9%, 8.9%, and 47.3% in the distal, middle, and proximal parts of the gown, respectively. The contamination rate at the elbow crease was 23%, and at 5 and 10 cm above the creases were 24% and 36%, respectively. Conclusion The high rate of gown contamination during the operation is concerning. However, part of the gown that was in contact with the operating room table remained clean most of the time. More safe strategies should be used for infection prevention in operating rooms.

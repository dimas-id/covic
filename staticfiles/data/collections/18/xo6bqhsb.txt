BACKGROUND We present a 67-year-old male, with palliative hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, who contracted COVID-19 infection while in hospital. Cancer diagnosis, among other clinical features, increases the risk of poor outcome of COVID-19 infection. A recently validated risk calculator (COVID-GRAM) can help to guide prognosis. EVENTS COVID-19 infection caused significant clinical deterioration in this patient. A Treatment Escalation Plan of ward-based care was put in place and the palliative care team involved. The goal of care was comfort. RESULTS The patient improved clinically and retested negative for COVID-19. He was discharged to a nursing home for ongoing supportive care of his malignancy. DISCUSSION The validated COVID-GRAM calculator predicted a greater than 99% risk that this patient would require intensive therapy unit admission or die. This patient overcame significant physiological challenges to survive COVID-19, highlighting the challenges of prognostication and suggesting that palliation of COVID-19 is not detrimental to survival.

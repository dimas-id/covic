We have studied the pathogenesis of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) pneumonitis in immunocompetent ICR mice and in mice treated with cyclophosphamide (CP). Intranasal infection of immunocompetent mice with MCMV resulted in transient and self-limited pulmonary lesions. When mice were given 200 mg/kg of CP one day before virus infection, transient splenic atrophy and subsequent splenic hypertrophy were induced, and the lesions in the lung were markedly augmented in their number and size although there was no significant enhancement of the virus growth. The augmentation coincided with the period of splenic hypertrophy. A marked increase in the number of pulmonary lesions was also induced in mice given 100 mg/kg of CP every 4 days following the initial dose of 200 mg/kg. In these mice, however, continuous splenic atrophy and augmented replication of MCMV in the lung were observed. When the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) in lung tissue homogenates was measured, the activity was found to significantly increase after intranasal infection with MCMV irrespective of CP administration and there was a good correlation between the elevation of XO activity and the degree of pathological changes in the lung. In addition, we found that the administration of allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of XO and superoxide dismutase, a superoxide radical scavenger, reduced the number of the pulmonary lesions. These results suggest that superoxide radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of MCMV-associated pneumonitis in ICR mice.

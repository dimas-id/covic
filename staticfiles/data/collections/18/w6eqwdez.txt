A 74-year-old woman who developed schwannoma of the sigmoid colon was referred to our hospital for colonography to determine the cause of her stool occult blood. Colonoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor, which measured 3 cm in diameter, in the sigmoid colon. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a low echoic, homogeneous and demarcated submucosal tumor that continued into the fourth layer of the colonic wall. Gastrointestinal stromal, myogenic or neurogenic tumor was suspected, and thus, laparoscopic sigmoidectomy was carried out. We used two ports during the operation, a SILS Port in the umbilical region and a 12-mm port in the right lower abdominal wall, and performed sigmoidectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. Histological findings revealed spindle-like tumor cells with multiform nuclei. The tumor was diagnosed by immunostaining as benign schwannoma of the sigmoid colon. The conventional surgical treatment for schwannoma of the digestive tract is partial resection, but if preoperative diagnosis is unknown, radical resection with lymphadenectomy is acceptable for submucosal tumors in the digestive tract. In this case, laparoscopic reduced port surgery using only one or two ports may be more feasible and beneficial with regard to cosmesis and reduced postoperative pain than conventional laparoscopic colectomy.

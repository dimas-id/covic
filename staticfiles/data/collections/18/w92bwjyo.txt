Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) runs a more benign course in children during the acute phase. Infants born to mothers with the disease did not acquire the infection through vertical transmission. The treatment strategy for children with SARS has not been standardised and is based on adult experience. Thus far, no deaths have been reported in the paediatric age group. Exercise impairment and residual radiological abnormalities were present six months after diagnosis. It is important to assess these patients on a regular basis to detect and provide appropriate management for any persistent or emerging long term sequelae in the physical, psychological, and social domains. This review describes the current understanding of SARS coronavirus infection in newborns and children.

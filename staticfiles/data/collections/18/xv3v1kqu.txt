BACKGROUND Obesity has been steadily increasing in the United States. The effect of body mass index (BMI) on surgical outcomes in pancreatic surgery is still controversial. Currently, there is no report related to obesity and robotic pancreatic surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of BMI on the surgical outcomes of both nonobese and obese patients undergoing robot-assisted distal pancreatectomy (RADP). METHODS A prospectively collected database for RADP was retrieved for analysis. Patients were categorized as obese (BMI â‰¥30 kg/m(2)) and nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). Demographics, perioperative data, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, diagnosis, conversion rate, morbidity, surgical mortality, pancreatic fistula rate, and length of stay were compared. RESULTS A total for 85 RADP were included, with 57 (67%) in the nonobese group and 28 (33%) in the obese group. No differences were found between nonobese and obese patients regarding demographic, preoperative risk, and perioperative parameters and mortality. There was a trend in the obese group associated with a higher rate of postoperative complications, but it was statistically insignificant. Clinically significant pancreatic fistula (grade B) occurred in 28.5% of obese patients and in 7% of nonobese patients, but without statistical significance (P = .064). CONCLUSIONS Obesity does not have a significant impact on the perioperative outcomes and surgical risks for patients undergoing RADP, but high BMI may be a predictor for pancreatic fistula after RADP.

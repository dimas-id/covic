Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a well-established treatment modality for several pediatric end-stage liver diseases owning excellent long-term results. Left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) through an open approach is a well-standardized procedure. This technique has been modified for a fully laparoscopic approach and gaining more and more interest worldwide. We report herein the first fully laparoscopic LLS for pediatric LDLT in the Middle East with the use of indocyanine green dye and near-infrared fluorescence imaging to identify the biliary ducts intraoperatively. The recipient was a 2-year-old girl affected by glycogen storage disease type IV. The mother, aged 21 years, was her donor. The surgical technique, key-points of this procedure, and outcome are hereby discussed.

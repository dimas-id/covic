We compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and COVID-19 and found that COVID-19 was more contagious, more concealed in transmission, with greater infectious intensity and more severe clinical manifestations. If the COVID-19 epidemic is not effectively controlled, it will have a serious impact on human health, and even social development. Recognizing the characteristics of three diseases, especially COVID-19, and improving the disease awareness of COVID-19 will help better implement the guidelines of "scientific prevention and treatment, precise implementation" and prevent and control COVID-19.

PURPOSE To report the initial clinical case of single-port transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) bilateral inguinal hernia repair. METHODS One patient with symptomatic bilateral inguinal hernias underwent a single-port TAPP hernia repair using the Triport Single Port System (ASC, TriPort Laparoscopic Access Device, Wicklow, Ireland). The device was placed through a single supraumbilical incision. Hernia repair was performed with a typical TAPP technique with implantation of an Ultrapro Mesh (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany). RESULTS The procedure was technically successful without placement of additional trocars. Operative time was 120 min. No blood loss and no intraoperative complications were observed. The patient was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day and follow-up at 2 weeks demonstrated the patient to be without complaints with uncomplicated wound healing. CONCLUSION Single-port TAPP bilateral inguinal hernia repair is technically feasible and safe.

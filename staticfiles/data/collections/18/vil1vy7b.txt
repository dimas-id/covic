We performed a retrospective study of Covid-19 in people with HIV (PWH). PWH with Covid-19 demonstrated severe lymphopenia and decreased CD4+ T cell counts. Levels of inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, D-dimer, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and TNF-alpha were commonly elevated. In all, 19/72 hospitalized individuals (26.4%) died and 53 (73.6%) recovered. PWH who died had higher levels of inflammatory markers and more severe lymphopenia than those who recovered. These findings suggest that PWH remain at risk for severe manifestations of Covid-19 despite ART and that those with increased markers of inflammation and immune dysregulation are at risk for worse outcomes.

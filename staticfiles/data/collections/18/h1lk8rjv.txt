OBJECTIVES Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, and is characterized by inflammation and myelin damage. The immune system initiates the autoimmune response, although the mechanisms of neuronal damage have not been elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, in conjunction with other inflammatory cells and cytokines in active MS lesions. METHODS EAE animal models was established by plantar injections of MBP (200 μg per rat). Purified CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood (EAE animals and control animals) via negative selection. To examine effects of presence of autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, we carried out ELISA, Western blot analysis and TUNEL. In addition, we examined the direct effects of various factors on neuronal cell death using MTT assay. RESULTS The data revealed that CD8+ T-cells were more toxic to neurons compared to CD4+ T-cells, in both the MBP and EAE conditions. Bax was greater increased when neurons were co-cultured with CD8+ T-cells in the MBP group. There is a significant increase in IL-17 secretion by CD4+ T-cells in both the MBP group and EAE group. Neuronal viability were affected by Perforin (1.5 μg/mL). CONCLUSION The present study extends previous research by demonstrating the role of CD8+ T-cells in MS and supports perforin secretion by CD8+ T-cells as a potential therapeutic factor. Furthermore, we determined that CD4+ T-cells can enhance CD8+ T-cell neuronal cytotoxicity via induction of intense inflammation.

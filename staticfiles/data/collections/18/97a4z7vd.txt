OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the concerns of General Surgery residents as they prepare to be in the frontlines of the response against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19_). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative study with voluntary dyadic and focus group interviews with a total of 30 General Surgery residents enrolled at 2 academic medical centers in Boston, Massachusetts was conducted between March 12 to 16, 2020. RESULTS: The most commonly reported personal concern related to the COVID-19 outbreak was the health of their family (30 of 30 [100%]), followed by the risk of their transmitting COVID-19 infection to their family members (24 of 30 [80%]); risk of their transmitting COVID-19 infection their patients (19 of 30 [63%]); anticipated overwork for taking care of a high number of patients (15 of 30 [50%]); and risk of their acquiring COVID-19 infection from their patients (8 of 30 [27%]) . The responses were comparable when stratified by sex, resident training level, and residency program. All residents self-expressed their readiness to take care of COVID-19 patients despite the risk of personal or familial harm . To improve their preparedness, they recommend increasing testing capacity, ensuring personal protective equipment availability, and transitioning to a shift schedule in order to minimize exposure risk and prevent burnout. CONCLUSIONS: General Surgery residents are fully dedicated to taking care of patients with COVID-19 infection despite the risk of personal or familial harm. Surgery departments should protect the physical and psychosocial wellbeing of General Surgery residents in order to increase their ability to provide care in the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.

With more than 3.8 million people infected Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a critical threat to human health. There is no proven vaccine or specific drug to date, which highlights the urgent need for rapid development of therapeutics for COVID-19. To identify potentially repurposable drugs, we employed a systematic approach to mine candidates from U.S. FDA approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by integrating the gene expression perturbation data by chemicals from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project with publically available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mild and severe COVID-19 patients. We identified 281 FDA approved drugs that have the potential to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 10 of which are currently undergoing clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy against COVID-19. In conclusion, we have identified a list of repurposable anti-SARS- CoV-2 drugs using a systems biology approach.

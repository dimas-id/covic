Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, as well as pancytopenias can be seen following solid organ transplant. Varying patterns of cytopenia can be seen based on the drugs used in the posttransplant period, infections encountered by the individual, as well as the individualâ€™s immune response and bone marrow function. The chapter discusses the main causes of anemia, leukopenia/neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. The differential diagnosis for anemia after solid organ transplant includes hemolysis, drug toxicities, iron deficiency, infection, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, graft-vs.-host disease, and hemophagocytic syndrome. Etiologies for leukopenia and neutropenia include drug toxicities and infection, and etiologies for thrombocytopenia include drug toxicities, infections, autoimmune events such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and underlying causes such as persistent portal hypertension and splenomegaly.

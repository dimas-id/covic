Vacuolar myelopathy belongs to the AIDS-associated diseases. It is characterized by vacuolation and infiltration of the long tracts of the spinal cord by macrophages. The clinical and morphological findings of 8 AIDS-patients with vacuolar myelopathy are reported here. The syndrome developed during the final stages of AIDS and was associated with HIV-encephalopathy in 5 cases. The vacuoles were mainly due to intramyelinic swelling and vacuolation. Vacuolated macrophages and axons contributed only to a minor degree. In one case only, HIV-antigens were detected immunohistochemically. The results are discussed in the light of modern pathogenetical concepts of HIV-related diseases.

Summary/Abstract We explore how the short-run effects of Covid-19 in reducing CO2 and local air pollutant emissions can easily be outweighed by the long-run effects of a slowing of clean energy innovation. Focusing on the United States, we show that in the short run, Covid-19 has reduced consumption for jet fuel and gasoline dramatically, by 50% and 30% respectively, while electricity demand has declined by less than 10%. CO2 emissions have declined by 15%, while local air pollutants have also declined, saving about 200 lives per month. However, there could be a deep impact on long-run innovation in clean energy, leading to an additional 2,500 MMT CO2 and 40 deaths per month on average to 2035. Even pushing back renewable electricity generation investments by one year would outweigh the emission reductions and avoided deaths from March-June 2020. The policy response will determine how Covid-19 ultimately influences the future path of emissions.

Abstract The appropriate focus in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been addressing access and delivery of care to the population impacted by the outbreak. All sectors of the U.S economy have been significantly impacted including physicians. Physician groups of all specialties and sizes have experienced the financial impact of the pandemic. Hospitals have received billions of dollars to support and enable them to handle emergencies and cover the cost of the disruption. However, many Vascular Surgeons are under great financial pressure because of postponement of all non-emergency procedures. The Federal Government has announced a myriad of programs in the form of grants and loans to reimburse physicians for some expenses and loss of revenue. It is more than likely that unless the public health emergency subsides significantly, many practices will suffer dire consequences without additional financial assistance. We attempt to provide a concise listing of such programs and resources available to assist Vascular Surgeons who are small businesses in accessing these opportunities.

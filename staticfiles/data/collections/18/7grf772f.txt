Abstract Background Respiratory tract infections are the most common cause of hospitalization in infants and young children and are typically caused by viral or, less commonly, bacterial pathogens. Existing non-molecular diagnostic methods have several drawbacks such as limited sensitivity, long turn-a-round time and limited number of pathogens that can be detected. Objectives Nucleic acid amplification methods can increase sensitivity and enable the initiation of appropriate interventions without delay. Broad-spectrum detection and identification circumvent the use of individual diagnostic DNA or RNA based assays. At present, several commercial assays are available for broad-spectrum detection. Study design We compared the performance of the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) with that of the Respifinder (Pathofinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) for 9 external quality assurance (EQA) panels (QCMD, Scotland) consisting of a total of 106 EQA samples. Results Both the RVP and the Respifinder assay have an excellent specificity. Sensitivity was 33% and 78% for the RVP and the Respifinder assay, respectively. For both assays, sensitivity was low for weak positive samples. Discussion The results of our study seem to indicate a better sensitivity for the Respifinder. Analysis of patient samples is necessary to evaluate the clinical performance.

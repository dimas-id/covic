New York City (NYC) has emerged as the global epicenter for the COVID-19 pandemic. The NYC Public Health System (NYC Health +Hospitals, NYC H + H) was key to the city's response because its vulnerable patient population was disproportionately affected by the disease. As cases rose in the city, NYC H+H carried out plans to greatly expand critical care capacity. Primary ICU spaces were identified and upgraded as needed, while new ICU spaces were created in emergency departments (EDs), procedural areas, and other inpatient units. Patients were transferred between hospitals in order to reduce strain. Critical care staffing was supplemented by temporary recruits, volunteers, and military deployments. Supplies to deliver critical care were monitored closely and obtained as needed to prevent interruptions. An ED action team was formed to ensure that the experience of frontline providers was informing network level decisions. The steps taken by NYC H+H greatly expanded its capacity to provide critical care during an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases in NYC. These steps, along with lessons learned, could inform preparations for other health systems during a primary or secondary surge of cases.

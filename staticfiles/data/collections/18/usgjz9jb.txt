The ongoing opioid crisis, now into its second decade, represents a global public health challenge. Moreover, the opioid crisis has manifested despite clinical access to three approved opioid use disorder medications: the full opioid agonist methadone, the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Although current opioid use disorder medications are underutilized, the ongoing opioid crisis has also identified the need for basic research to develop both safer and more effective opioid use disorder medications. Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that opioid-targeted vaccines or immunopharmacotherapies may be promising opioid use disorder therapeutics. One premise for this article is to critically examine whether vaccine effectiveness evaluated using preclinical antinociceptive endpoints is predictive of vaccine effectiveness on abuse-related endpoints such as drug self-administration, drug discrimination, and conditioned place preference. A second premise is to apply decades of knowledge in the preclinical evaluation of candidate small-molecule therapeutics for opioid use disorder to the preclinical evaluation of candidate opioid use disorder immunopharmacotherapies. We conclude with preclinical experimental design attributes to enhance preclinical-to-clinical translatability and potential future directions for immunopharmacotherapies to address the dynamic illicit opioid environment.

In recent years, acute outbreaks of epizootic diarrhea have occurred on many swine farms in China. Although the putative causative virus of the disease was not isolated, the genomic sequence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was consistently detected from feces of diseased pigs by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Here we report a complete genome sequence of PEDV which is apparently different from those of early PEDV circulated in Chinese swine herds.

BACKGROUND: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is an acute mucocutaneous eruption with blisters of the skin and haemorrhagic erosions of mucous membranes. This report describes air-leak syndrome and obstructive uropathy occurring simultaneously in a teenage patient affected by SJS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old Malay female with SJS suffered from bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, and obstructive uropathy as early complications of her disease. She required intubation, chest tube insertion, and bilateral ureteric stenting as part of her intensive care management. These extra-cutaneous complications of renal and pulmonary systems were likely secondary to widespread epithelial detachment. CONCLUSION: Despite paucity of cases in adult literature, post-renal causes for acute kidney injury must be considered in SJS, especially in the setting of gross haematuria. Bedside point-of-care ultrasonography may be a useful tool for excluding obstructive uropathy. Pneumothorax is a rare but documented complication of SJS in paediatric cases and, to a lesser extent, adult patients. Extra care should be exercised when caring for mechanically ventilated patients suffering from SJS.

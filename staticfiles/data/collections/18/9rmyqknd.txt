In a perspective derived from actor-network theory (ANT), ‘risk’ can be considered as a specific assemblage of heterogeneous entities as well as a proliferation of hybrids. The concept and ideas of ANT offer a meaningful approach to addressing the hybridity and heterogeneity of complex assemblages of risk. Furthermore, the theory provides a theoretical vocabulary to analyse settings of risk and disasters. Especially for ex post analysis of disasters, ANT is able to identify errors in process chains and management practice. In this regard, it deals with questions of stability/instability in management and organisations within the broader context of risk governance. The article discusses the following questions from an ANT perspective: What is ‘risk’ and how can it be managed? What are the general implications and benefits of an ANT approach to disaster risk management? In what ways does an ANT approach challenge some of the conventional wisdoms in the field of disaster risk management? The article shows the potential of ANT as an analytical tool in disaster risk management and as a tool for planning, design and decision-making.

Abstract Immunopotentiators derived from different natural sources are under investigation with varying success. This chapter gives an overview of developments from plants, fungi, marine organisms, and insects. Plant-derived immune stimulators consist of a diverse range of small molecules or large polysaccharides. Notable examples that have been assessed in both preclinical and clinical trials include saponins, tomatine, and inulin. Similarly, fungi produce a range of potential candidate molecules, with β-glucans showing the most promise. Other complex molecules that have established adjuvant activity include α-galactosylceramide (originally obtained from a marine sponge), chitosan (commonly produced from chitin from shrimps), and peptides (found in bee venom). Some organisms, for example, endophytic fungi and bees, produce immunostimulants using compounds obtained from plants. The main challenges facing this type of research and tools being developed to overcome them are examined.

Gastrointestinal stasis syndrome is a very common presentation of an ill rabbit to the veterinarian. The causes involved in this syndrome are often multifactorial, and an inappropriate diet puts the rabbit at a greater risk of developing this syndrome. Complications of this disorder can lead to gastrointestinal obstruction, a life-threatening condition that necessitates aggressive medical and in some case surgical therapy. Rabbits may also be presented with signs of diarrhea. However, abnormal cecotrophs must be differentiated from true intestinal diarrhea. The common causes, diagnosis and management of diarrhea including dysbiosis and enteritis are discussed. Other important causes of gastrointestinal disease are infectious disease and liver lobe torsion. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus has a new variant that has been identified in mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Subclinical infection of intestinal coccidiosis is a common cause of weight loss in adult rabbits. Liver lobe torsion is a challenging condition to diagnose in rabbits; this chapter discusses the presenting signs, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic options.

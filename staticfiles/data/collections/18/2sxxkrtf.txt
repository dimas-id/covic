In the face of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals on the frontline are in urgent need of frequent updates in the accomplishment of their practice. Hence, clinicians started to search for prompt, valid information on sources parallel to academic journals publications. Aim of this work is to investigate the extent of this phenomenon. We administered an anonymous online cross-sectional survey to 645 Italian clinicians. 369 questionnaires were returned. 19,5% (n=72) of respondents were younger than 30 years-old; 49,3% (n=182) worked in Infectious Diseases, Internal Medicine or Respiratory Medicine departments, 11.5% (n=42) in Intensive Care Unit and 7.4% (n=27) were general practitioner. 70% (n=261) of respondents reported that their use of social media to seek medical information increased during the pandemic. 39.3% (n = 145) consistently consulted Facebook groups and 53.1% (n = 196) Whatsapp chats. 47% (n = 174) of respondents reported that information shared on social media had a consistent impact on their daily practice. In the present study, we found no difference in social media usage between age groups or medical specialties. Given the urgent need for scientific update in face of the present health emergency, these findings may help understanding how clinicians access new evidences and implement them in their daily practice.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is expanding rapidly, which made it as one of top priorities for scientists to develop novel treatment strategies. Researchers are racing to develop treatments based on antibodies to block and/or neutralize the coronavirus in affected patients. Initially, the genetic and structural similarity of the virus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) created the potential for understanding disease pathogenesis. Researchers have published reports of specific monoclonal antibodies against to COVID-19 (B38, H4, 47D11) and hope that this method is effective. As well as studies on patients who are plasma therapy, the patient's condition shows improvement. The evidence for these studies is very promising and demonstrates the potential of monoclonal antibody therapy as a therapeutic approach and prevention of covid-19 infection.

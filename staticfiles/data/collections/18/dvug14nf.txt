The combination of standard laparoscopy and specimen extraction through a natural orifice has the potential to decrease wound related complications. We describe the technical approach to laparoscopic sigmoidectomy in which the specimen is extracted transanally through a proctoscope. Laparoscopic-assisted sigmoidectomy with transanal specimen removal avoids an abdominal wall extraction incision and may be considered an alternative approach to conventional minimally invasive sigmoidectomy in patients with disease of the sigmoid or left colon.

This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 and the global pandemic on the energy sector dynamics. Hourly electricity demand data was collected and analyzed for the province of Ontario. It is evident that health-related pandemics have a detrimental and direct influence on the concept of the smart city. This is manifested through various social, economic, environmental, technological and energy-related changes. The overall electricity demand of the province for the month of April of this year amidst pandemic conditions declined by 14%, totaling 1,267 GW. A unique trend of reciprocating energy demand exists throughout the week. The post-COVID-19 indicates higher energy demand in the earlier part of the week and a lower demand in the latter part of the week. Pre-pandemic, the days of highest electricity demand were in the latter part of the work week (Wed-Fri) in addition to the weekend. Post-pandemic, the highest electricity demand occurred in the earlier part of the week (Mon-Tue). Hourly electricity demand shows a clear curve flattening during the pandemic, especially during peak hours of 7 – 11 in the morning and 5 – 7 in the evening, resulting in significant demand reductions during these periods. Lastly, due to COVID-19, GHG emission reductions of 40,000 tonnes of CO(2)e were achieved along with savings of $131,844 for the month of April.

CASE A 56-year-old man with a remote history of a left below-the-knee amputation (BKA) presented to the emergency department with an ipsilateral intertrochanteric fracture (IT). This case produced an operative challenge because commonly used intraoperative traction methods could not be applied to a patient with a BKA. CONCLUSION We describe a rarely utilized surgical technique of applying traction to an amputated extremity through an inverted boot on a fracture table during open reduction and internal fixation of an IT.

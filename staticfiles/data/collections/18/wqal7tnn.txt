Our studies are mainly focused on developing strategies of immune regulation. In the case of infectious and neoplastic disease, our approach is to upregulate cell-mediated immunity to viral of tumor antigens using an intracellular bacterium as a vector for targeting these antigens to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II pathways of antigen processing, in addition to exploiting the adjuvant properties of the vector to stimulate innate immunity. In the area of autoimmunity, we are attempting to downregulate the immune response by specific immune intervention directed against autoreactive T cells. In these studies we use murine models for multiple sclerosis. Our approach is to use both rationally designed T cell receptor (TCR) peptide analogs and recombinant viral vectors that express TCR components to regulate the disease.

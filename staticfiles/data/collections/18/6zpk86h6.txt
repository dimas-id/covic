For most machine learning tasks big computing power is needed, but some tasks can be done with microcontrollers. In this paper well-known SoC ESP32 has been analyzed. It is usually used in IoT devices for data measurement, but some authors started to use simple machine learning algorithms with them. Generally, this paper will analyze the possibility of using ESP32 with a built-in camera for machine learning algorithms. Focus of research will be on durations of photographing and photograph processing, because that can be a bottleneck of a machine learning tasks. For this purpose, logistic regression has been implemented on ESP32 with camera. It has been used to differentiate two handwritten letters on the greyscale pictures (“o” and “x”). Logistic regression weights have been calculated on the cloud, but then they have been transferred to an ESP32. The output results have been analyzed. The duration of photographing and processing were analyzed as well as the impact of implemented PSRAM memory on performances. It can be concluded that ESP32 with camera can be used for some simple machine learning tasks and for camera picture taking and preparing for other more powerful processors. Arduino IDE still does not provide enough level of optimization for implemented PSRAM memory.

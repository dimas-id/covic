Until the mid-1980s, cholecystectomy was performed through a generous right upper abdominal incision. After the early reports from Europe and the United States on the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the minimally invasive revolution began. This revolution has continued to the current time, where surgeons are attempting to perform minimally invasive procedures with less or no visible scarring. Cholecystectomy is ideally suited for the single-site umbilical laparoscopic approach to obviate the need for epigastric and supraumbilical incisions. This article will describe the single-site umbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which has been performed at Children's Mercy Hospital since 2009. Also, the literature concerning this approach in adults and in children will be discussed. Finally, a prospective randomized trial comparing the single-site cholecystectomy with the traditional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy will also be described.

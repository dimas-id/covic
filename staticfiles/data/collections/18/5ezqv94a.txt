Abstract The development of information technology highly affects various business sectors including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Social media implementation, as one of the most widely used IT application, is expected to support SMEsâ€™ performances. Many types of research in social media have focused on the impact of its implementation on the performance of an organization at a macro level. Research that investigates the linkage between social media and how the company performs its business process is lacking in the literature to date. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a literature review on social media implementation particularly in SMEs. The result of this study is a conceptual model that follows the proposition of Task-Technology Fit in exploring the impact of social media on SMEs business process performances. As a technology, social media functionality must fit the tasks that SMEs must perform. The model proposed social media alignment with business process domain based on the Process Classification Framework (PCF). The performances are measured at a business process level using four indicators i.e. cost, time, quality and flexibility of the business process.

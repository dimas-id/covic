â¢Most of the COVID-19 cases in Nepal are in the Southern districts of Nepal bordering India and many cases have travel history to India.â¢Very few positive cases of COVID-19 are detected in Nepal which could either be due to early national lockdown or inefficiency of PCR methods.â¢Whole genomes of 93 clinical samples from COVID-19 patients were analysed to find the primer and probe binding sites.â¢Mutations in probe binding sites were found and this could significantly impact PCR efficiency resulting in false negative results.

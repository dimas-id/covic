In December 2019, the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified and named as SARS-CoV-2. Since then it has been spreading and severe form of the illness predominantly occurs in adults with advanced age or underlying comorbidities. The European AIDS Clinical Society states the lack of evidence for a higher COVID-19 infection rate among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and there is a few published literature on the course of COVID-19 co-infection in PLHIV. We described four HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients with different characteristics. The impression is that comorbidities is an important factor in mortality in HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infected cases.

Abstract Background and Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown has presented a unique challenge for sarcoma care The purpose of this study is to evaluate the early results and feasibility of surgeries for bone sarcomas during the COVID-19 lockdown Methods Our prospectively collected orthopaedic oncological database was reviewed to include two groups of patients- those who underwent surgery in the immediate 4 weeks before lockdown (non-lockdown group) and those operated in the first 4 weeks of lockdown (lockdown group) All patients were followed-up clinically and telephonically to collect the outcome data Results Out of the 91 patients who qualified for inclusion, fifty were classified into the non-lockdown group while 41 patients formed the lockdown group Both the groups were comparable with respect to baseline demographic parameters However, during the lockdown period 37 patients (90%) had undergone a major surgical intervention as against 24 patients (48%) in the non-lockdown group (P?&lt;? 001) There was no significant difference in type of anaesthesia, median estimated blood loss and procedure duration None of the patients/health care workers had evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection at 15 days follow-up Conclusion Our study results suggest that appendicular bone tumours can be safely operated with adequate precautions during the lockdown period

Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed as a less invasive surgical procedure, but it remains difficult because of its specific skills and left-right reversal of the instruments. Such a difference makes manipulating endoscopic instruments more challenging and increases the risk. In this study, we introduce the cross hand technique allowing the surgeon to manipulate instruments with intuitive movement.

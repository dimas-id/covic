INTRODUCTION The aim of the study is to investigate the outcomes of the da Vinci robot-assisted laparoscopic hernia repair of small-sized ventral hernias with circumferential suturing of the mesh compared to the traditional laparoscopic repair with trans-fascial suturing. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all robot-assisted umbilical, epigastric and incisional hernia repairs performed at our institution between 2013 and 2015 compared to laparoscopic umbilical or epigastric hernia repairs. Patient characteristics, operative details and postoperative complications were collected and analyzed using univariate analysis. Three primary minimally invasive fellowship trained surgeons performed all of the procedures included in the analysis. RESULTS 72 patients were identified during the study period. 39 patients underwent robot- assisted repair (21 umbilical, 14 epigastric, 4 incisional), and 33 patients laparoscopic repair (27 umbilical, 6 epigastric). Seven had recurrent hernias (robot: 4, laparoscopic: 3). There were no significant differences in preoperative characteristics between the two groups. Average operative time was 156 min for robot-assisted repair and 65 min for laparoscopic repair (p < 0.0001). The average defect size was significantly larger for the robot group [3.07 cm (1-9 cm)] than that for the laparoscopic group [2.02 cm (0.5-5 cm)] (p < 0.0001), although there was no significant difference in the average size of mesh used (13 vs. 13 cm). There was no difference in patients requiring postoperative admission or length of stay between the two groups. The mean duration of follow-up was 47 days. There was no difference in complication rate during this time, and no recurrences were reported. CONCLUSION There are no significant differences in terms of safety and early efficacy when comparing small-sized ventral hernias repaired using the robot-assisted technique versus the standard laparoscopic repair.

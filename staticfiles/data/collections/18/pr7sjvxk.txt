Cytokines and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are intertwined in the regulatory circuit controlling immunity. lncRNA expression levels are altered following cytokine stimulation in a cell-type-specific fashion. lncRNAs, in turn, regulate the inducible expression of cytokines following immune activation. These studies position lncRNAs as important regulators of gene expression within the complex pathways of the immune system. Our understanding of the functions of lncRNAs is just beginning. Current methodologies for functionally understanding how these transcripts mediate their effects are unable to keep up with the speed of genomic outputs cataloging thousands of these novel genes. In this review, we highlight the interplay between cytokines and lncRNAs and speculate on the future utility of these genes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

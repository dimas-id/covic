In total, 245 Cryptosporidium parvum specimens obtained from calves in 205 Irish herds between 2003 and 2005 were subtyped by sequencing the glycoprotein gene gp60 and performing multilocus analysis of seven markers. The transmission dynamics of C. parvum and the influence of temporal, spatial, parasitic, and host-related factors on the parasite (sub)populations were studied. The relationship of those factors to the risk of cryptosporidiosis was also investigated using results from 1,368 fecal specimens submitted to the veterinary laboratories for routine diagnosis during 2005. The prevalence was greatest in the northwest and midwest of the country and on farms that bought in calves. The panmixia (random mating) detected in the C. parvum population may relate to its high prevalence, the cattle density, and the frequent movement of cattle. However, local variations in these factors were reflected in the C. parvum subpopulations. This study demonstrated the importance of biosecurity in the control of bovine cryptosporidiosis (e.g., isolation and testing of calves before introduction into a herd). Furthermore, the zoonotic risk of C. parvum was confirmed, as most specimens possessed GP60 and MS1 subtypes previously described in humans.

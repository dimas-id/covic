In this paper an expanded mixed formulation is introduced to solve the two dimensional space fractional Darcy flow in porous media. By introducing an auxiliary vector, we derive a new mixed formulation and the well-possedness of the formulation can be established. Then the locally mass-conservative expanded mixed finite element method is applied for the solution. Numerical results are shown to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

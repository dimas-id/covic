Abstract This study compares the detection of enterovirus RNA by cDNA probes prepared from both the 5' and 3' end of the genome of coxsackíe A21 and B4 with the use of synthetic oligonucleotides prepared from short but highly conserved sequences in the 5' end non-coding region of the picornavirus genome. The cDNA probes detected enteroviruses with a variable level of sensitivity which presumably depended on the degree of genomic homology with the detecting probes. Generally probes from coxsackievirus A21 detected more enteroviruses than did similar probes from coxsackievirus B4. Probes from the 5' end of the genome of both viruses were more sensitive than 3' end probes. In contrast, synthetic oligonucleotides detected all enteroviruses efficiently suggesting that these probes could be useful as ‘universal’ probes to detect any enterovirus. This paper discusses the application of these probes in the diagnosis and differentiation of enteroviruses.

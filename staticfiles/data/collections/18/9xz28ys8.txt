Mathematical models have been recognized as powerful tools for providing new insights into the understanding of viral dynamics of human diseases at both the population and cellular levels. This article briefly reviews the role of mathematical models and‚ê£their historical precedents for creating new knowledge of the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, transmission, and control of some human viral infections. Future research in the modelling of infectious diseases will need to rely upon incorporation of the fundamental principles that govern viral dynamics in vivo as well as in the population.

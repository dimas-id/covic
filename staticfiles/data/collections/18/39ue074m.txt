BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with acute ischemic stroke are at high-risk for contracting COVID-19 infection. Additionally, healthcare professionals including neurovascular ultrasound providers are also at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Yet, preparedness to continue to guarantee hyperacute treatment is vital for patients outcome. In light of this situation, the European Society of Neurosonology and Cerebral Hemodynamic (ESNCH) appointed a task force to provide consensus recommendations for the performance of neurovascular ultrasound investigations in acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of protecting both patients and ultrasound providers. METHODS: The "ultrasound in acute stroke working group" of the ESNCH examined literature articles and reviews using the following key words: "corona virus" or "COVID-19" or "SARS-CoV-2 virus", and "acute stroke" or "cerebrovascular disease", and "ultrasound". Thereafter, a thorough discussion was conducted with the "education and guidelines working group" of the ESNCH. RESULTS: We propose rapid up-to-date recommendations for healthcare personnel involved in the pre-hospital and intra-hospital assessment of stroke patients, with a particular attention to neurovascular ultrasound performance. CONCLUSION: The ESNCH provides a guidance summary for the performance of neurovascular ultrasound investigations in acute ischemic stroke in the time of COVID-19.

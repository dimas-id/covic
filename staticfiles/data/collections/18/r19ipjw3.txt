Computer algebra systems (CAS) are often used programs in universities to support calculations and visualization in teaching mathematical subjects. In this paper we present some examples of dynamic visualizations which we prepared for students of Warsaw University of Life Sciences using Mathematica. Visualizations for simplex algorithm and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker algorithm are presented. We also describe a didactic experiment for students of the Production Engineering Faculty of Warsaw University of Life Sciences using dynamic visualization of the network flow problem.

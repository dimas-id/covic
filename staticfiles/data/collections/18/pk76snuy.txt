Though transplantation of cells, tissue or organ has been regarded as an ideal approach, scarcity of donor is a practical barrier in clinics. Current progresses in cell engineering has opened a new era, providing tools for host-regeneration by implanting manipulated cells in forms of cell therapy, which includes delivery of single cells or multicellular structural support of hybridized cells, as a representative individualized treatment method. This chapter mainly concerns on the cellbased implant made of cells and collagen, the main structural protein in extracellular matrix in mammalian tissue, as it has been regarded as a promising method for manufacturing a biologically mimicked artificial tissues.

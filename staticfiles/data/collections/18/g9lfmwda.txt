PURPOSE The purpose of the study was to evaluate feasibility of pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) in the treatment of Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) followed by thoracoscopic or open surgical decompression of the subclavian vein. METHODS Twenty-two out of 27 consecutive patients with PSS received PMT using the Trellis-8 peripheral infusion system (Covidien) between 2010 and 2014. Subsequent surgery was performed in 18 of those patients, 9 patients were treated with thoracoscopic, 7 patients with subclavicular, and 2 patients with transaxillary first rib resection, 4 patients were treated with PMT and anticoagulation alone. Technical success, complications, and patency were registered. RESULTS PMT was successful in 21 (95 %) patients; 1 patient with unsatisfactory lysis received further catheter-directed thrombolysis, which, however, did not improve the result. The mean endovascular procedure time was 105 ± 33 min (range 70-200 min), and the required median amount of thrombolytic agent was 500,000 international unit (IU; range 250,000-1,000,000 IU). Adjunctive balloon venoplasty and aspiration were used in 18 (82 %) and 7 (32 %) cases, respectively. One patient had an intimal tear of the subclavian vein that was discovered and repaired during surgery. There were no other complications related to the endovascular procedure. At follow-up, 18 of 21 patients (86 %) with follow-up imaging available had patent subclavian vein, and all except 1 of the 22 patients were asymptomatic. The mean follow-up time was 25 ± 17 months. CONCLUSIONS In experienced hands, PMT is effective for early thrombus removal in PSS. Surgical decompression must be considered after PMT.

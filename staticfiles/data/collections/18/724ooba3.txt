The beneficial effects of functionally useful plants (e.g. medicinal and food plants) arise from the multi-target activities of multiple ingredients of these plants. The knowledge of the collective molecular activities of these plants facilitates mechanistic studies and expanded applications. A number of databases provide information about the effects and targets of various plants and ingredients. More comprehensive information is needed for broader classes of plants and for the landscapes of individual plant's multiple targets, collective activities and regulated biological pathways, processes and diseases. We therefore developed a new database, Collective Molecular Activities of Useful Plants (CMAUP), to provide the collective landscapes of multiple targets (ChEMBL target classes) and activity levels (in 2D target-ingredient heatmap), and regulated gene ontologies (GO categories), biological pathways (KEGG categories) and diseases (ICD blocks) for 5645 plants (2567 medicinal, 170 food, 1567 edible, 3 agricultural and 119 garden plants) collected from or traditionally used in 153 countries and regions. These landscapes were derived from 47 645 plant ingredients active against 646 targets in 234 KEGG pathways associated with 2473 gene ontologies and 656 diseases. CMAUP (http://bidd2.nus.edu.sg/CMAUP/) is freely accessible and searchable by keywords, plant usage classes, species families, targets, KEGG pathways, gene ontologies, diseases (ICD code) and geographical locations.

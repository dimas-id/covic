BACKGROUND The management of tracheal tube cuff pressure in patients receiving mechanical ventilation is important for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Currently, cuff pressure is intermittently monitored with a pressure gauge and adjusted when necessary in a routine practice. However, this method results in wide variations in pressure, and adequate management is difficult due to the spontaneous release of air from the cuff, which reduces cuff pressure. In order to continuously maintain a uniform cuff pressure, we developed a new automated cuff pressure controller and compared its properties with existing devices. METHODS The effectiveness of the new device was assessed with a model trachea/lung and tracheal tube by measuring cuff pressure while on mechanical ventilation. An electrically powered automatic cuff controller or manual cuff pressure control was used for comparison purposes. The effectiveness of the new device was also examined in patients receiving mechanical ventilation by continuously measuring cuff pressure for a 24-h period. RESULTS Cuff pressure was uniformly maintained with the new device. Moreover, in the clinical setting, variation in pressure from the set pressure was minimal with both the new device and existing device, relative to the intermittent monitoring method. This suggests that, as with the existing device, uniform cuff pressure management is possible with the new device. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the ability of the new cuff pressure controller to manage cuff pressure without the need of a power source, highlighting its potential utility in clinical settings.

Rubella virus (RV) infection during the early stages of pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects, known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This retrospective study was conducted between 1996 and 2009 with surveillance specimens collected from patients suspected of congenital rubella infection (CRI) and CRS. The clinical samples (nine amminiotic fluid, eight urine, eight blood, one conception product, and one placenta) were sent for viral isolation and genotyping. Twenty‐seven sequences were analysed and four genotypes (1a, 1B, 1G, and 2B) were identified in São Paulo that were involved in congenital infection. To our knowledge, this study is the first report that describes genetic diversity of the circulating rubella strains involved in CRI. J Med. Virol. 85:2034–2041, 2013. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The clinical presentations for most infectious agents are often not specific enough to allow for a definitive diagnosis. Coughing and fever, for example, are symptoms that may be caused by many different bacterial or viral infections. Thus, for better treatment and disease control, a molecular differential diagnostic (MDD) assay that can identify, differentiate, and pinpoint the offending pathogen associated with a clinical syndrome (Fig. 27.1) is needed. MDDs are essential tools for effective infectious disease surveillance, biodefense, and personalized medicine.

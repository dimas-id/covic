Abstract During Ebola virus (EBOV) infection, secreted glycoprotein (sGP) is found in large quantities in the serum of both patients and infected animal models. It is thought to serve as a decoy for anti-EBOV antibodies. Using an in vitro model incorporating treatment of non-infected human THP-1 macrophages with recombinant EBOV sGP, this study sought to examine the impact of sGP upon key macrophage functions. Macrophage polarization and phagocytic capacity of activated macrophages were found to be unaltered by sGP treatment. However, treatment with sGP inhibited macrophage production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFÎ± and IL-6 while the yield of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, remained intact. Interestingly, the migratory ability of macrophages was also diminished by sGP, potentially due to a decrease in expression of CD11b, a vital macrophage integrin. Thus, EBOV sGP may operate to diminish functional contributions of non-infected macrophages to increase the potential viral dissemination.

BACKGROUND: Upper airway infections contribute significantly to paediatric morbidity and hospitalization especially of young children, are often treated polypragmatically, and are one of the main reasons for antibiotic prescriptions. The severity varies between mild, self-limiting and potentially life-threatening airway obstructions. DIAGNOSIS: The physician involved can normally make the right diagnosis based on the patientâ€²s history and physical findings; additional diagnostic procedures (blood tests, imaging) should be restricted to unclear cases. THERAPY: Antibiotic stewardship should be applied. Imminent airway obstruction will require early and competent paediatric intensive care interventions. Since viral and bacterial upper airway infections can present with similar features, it is useful to approach them under topographical aspects. PREVENTION: Following immunization recommendations can prevent an enormous amount of severe potentially life threatening airway infections.

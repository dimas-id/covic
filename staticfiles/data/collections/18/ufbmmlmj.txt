Quarantine and isolation are public health measures used for centuries to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Quarantine is separation of persons who have been exposed to an infection but asymptomatic, while isolation is separation of infected patients. Voluntary quarantine is preferred, but if necessary, it can be mandatory. These implementations can lead to restrictions on individual liberties, leading to ethical and legal problems. Isolation and quarantine enforcement are regulated by laws. Those who do not follow the quarantine rules could be punished. Isolation and quarantine practices in our country are described in General Hygiene Law. In this study the importance of quarantine, when and how it is applied, and its ethical and especially legal dimension are discussed.

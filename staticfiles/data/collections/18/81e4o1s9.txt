In this study, we compared the plasma concentrations of meloxicam in pediatric rat pups (ages: 7, 14, 21, and 28 d) with those of young adult rats. Adult rats received 1.34 mg/kg SC meloxicam to determine the target peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for comparison with the pediatric animals. Pediatric rats received 1.34 mg/kg SC meloxicam, and in all age groups, Cmax met or exceeded that in adults (11.5 ±2.7 μg/mL). Plasma concentrations were similar between male and female pups within age groups, and peak plasma concentration was achieved more rapidly in rat pups than adults. The analgesic efficacy of this dose was not evaluated in this study.

Mechanical thrombectomy using the stent retriever has been proven to be effective for select patients with acute ischemic stroke. We evaluated our early experience using the device after its approval in 2014 in Japan, with a special emphasis on the occlusion site. Fifty consecutive endovascular revascularization procedures for treating anterior acute large vessel occlusion were performed using the Trevo ProVue as the first-line device at our institute between April 2015 and March 2016. Focusing on the involvement of the M1-M2 bifurcation with deployment or retrieval of the stent retriever, we regarded the middle cerebral artery M1 mid-portion as the boundary and divided the cases into proximal (n = 26) and distal (n = 24) groups. We assessed the overall clinical outcome and compared the outcome between the two groups. Among 50 patients (median age, 80 years; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) score, 20), successful (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score (TICI) 2b or 3) or complete revascularization (TICI 3) was achieved in 41 patients (82%; 88% in the proximal group vs 75% in the distal group, P = 0.28) and in 27 patients (54%; 73% vs 33%, P = 0.01), respectively. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in three patients (6%; 4% vs 8%, P = 0.60). A good outcome (mRS score 0 to 2) was obtained in 25 patients at 90 days (50%; 54% vs 46%, P = 0.78). Mechanical thrombectomy using the Trevo ProVue was safe and effective in patients with acute cerebral artery occlusion, especially for proximal occlusions. The efficacy of the procedure for distal occlusions was somewhat inferior to those for proximal occlusions, which might be resolved by next generation devices.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has caused a large global pandemic and poses a serious threat to public health. More than four million cases of COVID‐19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), have been confirmed as of May 11, 2020. SARS‐CoV‐2 is a highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus that primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact. A growing body of clinical data suggests that a cytokine storm is associated with COVID‐19 severity and is also a crucial cause of death from COVID‐19. In the absence of antivirals and vaccines for COVID‐19, there is an urgent need to understand the cytokine storm in COVID‐19. Here, we have reviewed the current understanding of the features of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the pathological features, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatments of the cytokine storm induced by COVID‐19. Additionally, we suggest that the identification and treatment of the cytokine storm are important components for rescuing patients with severe COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright.

Arterial aneurysms are uncommon among patients with dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVFs), and there is limited information available to guide treatment decisions in such cases. We performed a systematic review of the literature, including a case of a DAVF associated with a flow-related intraorbital ophthalmic artery (OA) aneurysm that we have recently managed. The purpose of our study was to clarify epidemiology, natural history, and management of these lesions. A total of 43 published cases of DAVF associated aneurysms were found in 26 studies on the topic. Anterior cranial fossa was the most common location (40%), and ethmoidal branches were the most common arterial feeders (55%). In about 63% of cases, the aneurysm was located on artery unrelated to DAVF supply. Approximately 10% of intracranial DAVFs were associated with aneurysms located in the intraorbital OA. Overall, 70% of lesions were Borden type III, and 50% of patients presented with hemorrhage. In approximately 17% of cases, the source of bleeding was a feeding artery aneurysm. All of the reported intraorbital OA aneurysms associated with DAVFs remained stable during follow-up. DAVF associated aneurysms are fairly rare. Anterior cranial fossa location and direct cortical venous drainage are common among these lesions. The aneurysms are less likely to be located on feeding arteries, and hemorrhagic presentation related to flow-related aneurysm rupture is uncommon.

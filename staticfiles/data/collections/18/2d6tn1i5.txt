A 43-year-old man underwent a low anterior resection of the rectum due to upper rectal cancer. The pathological Stage was â £ with para-aortic lymph node metastasis. Postoperative chemotherapy with CapeOX was initiated, but para-aortic lymph node metastasis was discovered 4months after the surgery. Chemoradiation therapy with Cape and Bev, and 70 Gy/28 Fr led to the disappearance of the metastasized lesions. At 13months after the surgery, FDG accumulation was observed in the Virchow's lymph node, and chemotherapy with IRIS and Bev was initially administered. Subsequently, chemoradiation therapy with S-1 and Bev, and 66 Gy/33Fr was administered, followed by chemotherapy with S-1 and Bev, S-1. These therapies led to complete response(CR). However, 35 months after the surgery, the Virchow's lymph node had enlarged again, and chemoradiation therapy with S-1 and 60 Gy/30Fr was administered. Although no FDG accumulation was detected in the lymph node at 40 months after the surgery, metastasis was found in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Panitumumab therapy achieved CR, and no metastasis had been identified at 60 months after the final therapy. Chemoradiation therapy is a treatment option to improve the prognosis of patients with metastasis only in the Virchow's lymph node.

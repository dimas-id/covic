Liver enzymes, including aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase, are some of the most commonly ordered blood tests in a physician's practice. These enzymes have been valuable in screening for liver disease, as well as in diagnosing and monitoring patients with acute and chronic hepatobiliary disorders. Patients with predominantly aminotransferase elevations are thought to have acute or chronic hepatitis from a variety of causes. In patients with predominantly alkaline phosphatase elevations, imaging evaluation is undertaken upfront to exclude large bile duct disorders and infiltrative/mass lesions. A liver biopsy may be reserved for patients for whom these less invasive investigations are unfruitful.

BACKGROUND For complex right colon polyps, not removable using colonoscopy, right colon resection is considered the optimal treatment. Combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery, using both laparoscopy and CO2 colonoscopy, has been introduced as a new approach for these complex colon polyps with intent to avoid bowel resection. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the safety and outcomes of combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery used for treatment of complex right colon polyps. DESIGN This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery for treatment of benign right colon polyps from 2003 to 2008. SETTINGS This is a single-institution study. PATIENTS Twenty-three patients with complex right colon polyps were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures included the length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and polyp recurrence. RESULTS Of 23 patients, 20 (87%) patients had their polyp removed successfully by combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery and 3 (13%) needed laparoscopic resection, after laparoendoscopic evaluation. The median length of hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-5), and there were no postoperative complications. Median follow-up time was 12 months. Three patients had recurrent polyps, and the recurrence-free interval at 36 months was 55.7% (95% CI = 8.6%, 87.0%). All recurrences were benign polyps and were removed by colonoscopic snaring. CONCLUSIONS Combined endoscopic-laparoscopic surgery can be safely offered to selected patients with benign right colon polyps that can not be removed by colonoscopy. This combined approach may provide a viable alternative to right colon resection for complex benign colon lesions and warrants future investigation.

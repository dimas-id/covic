We compare the COVID-19 pandemic and 1918-19 influenza pandemic in United Kingdom. We found that the on-going COVID-19 wave of infection matched the major wave of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic surprisingly well, both reached similar magnitude (in term of estimated weekly new infections) and spent the same duration above 5 cases per 1000 inhabitants, for the past two months. We discussed the similar characteristics between these two pandemics.

In this paper, we investigate the distributed link removal strategy for networked meta-population epidemics. In particular, a deterministic networked susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is considered to describe the epidemic evolving process. In order to curb the spread of epidemics, we present the spectrum-based optimization problem involving the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of the matrix constructed by the network topology and transition rates. A modified distributed link removal strategy is developed such that it can be applied to the SIR model with heterogeneous transition rates on weighted digraphs. The proposed approach is implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic by using the reported infected and recovered data in each state of Germany. The numerical experiment shows that the infected percentage can be significantly reduced by using the distributed link removal strategy.

The author begins Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-63236-0_2 with the general locations of rainforests (Afrotropical, Neotropical, and Indo-Pacific region) and outlines the specific countries that host rainforests. The author then provides a historical and current context of tropical rainforest deforestation and degradation. Maps are provided showing the forest cover loss from 2000 to 2014 in these select regions. The author then presents a more detailed discussion about the role of cattle, soybeans, and palm oil, along with the role of timber, pulp and paper, forest fires, population and consumption, and infrastructure. The author then concludes with an explanation of why tropical rainforests are important, such as due to their provisioning services, regulating services, habitat or supporting services, and cultural services.

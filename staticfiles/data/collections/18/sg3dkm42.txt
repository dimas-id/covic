The COVID-19 pandemic will impact on how care for chronic conditions is delivered. We use epilepsy to exemplify how care for patients will be affected, and suggest ways in which healthcare systems can respond to deliver the most effective care. Where face-to-face outpatient appointments have been cancelled, telemedicine can facilitate remote clinical consultations for new and follow-up epilepsy clinic patients while reducing the risk of infection to both patients and healthcare staff. First-seizure patients will need investigation pathways rationalised, while those with chronic epilepsy will need to have reliable alternative avenues to access clinical advice. At the same time, neurologists should support emergency departments and acute medical units, advising on appropriate management of seizures and other acute neurological presentations. Ultimately, the revolution in our clinical practice is unlikely to cease after this pandemic, with reconfiguration of services likely to bring improvements in efficiency and convenience, and a reduced environmental impact.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, safety and effectiveness of percutaneous image-guided microwave ablation (MWA) in Bosniak category III or IV cystic renal lesions after 24 months follow-up duration. METHODS Between May 2008 and December 2012, computed tomography (CT)- or ultrasound (US)-guided MWA was performed in 6 patients with 7 cystic renal lesions (range 13.8-27 mm, mean 17.02 mm, SD 8.5 mm) Bosniak category III or IV. The number of treatment sessions, treatment results, lesion size changes and complications were evaluated. Technical success (TS), technical effectiveness (TE), local tumor progression rate (LTPR), cancer-specific survival rate (CSSR) and overall survival rate (OSR) were computed. MAIN FINDINGS TS was 100% (7/7) and TE was 100%; LTPR was 0%; CSSR and OSR were 100%. No major complications were observed. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience with MWA shows a potential role for US/CT-guided percutaneous MWA in treating Bosniak category III or IV cystic renal lesions, as a safe approach to treat selected patients not suitable for surgery.

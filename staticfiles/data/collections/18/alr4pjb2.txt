Cell-culture-adapted (ca) porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) contains three internal open reading frames (I ORF) within the nucleocapsid protein gene and lacks the downstream counterpart of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus ORF7 or feline infectious peritonitis virus ORF6a. To confirm whether such features also exist in wild-type (wt) PEDV, the 3' 1800 nucleotides of its genome were sequenced and were found to be identical to those of ca virus. The coding potential of I-1 ORF was ascertained by transient expression in Vero cells followed by immunofluorescence using antipeptide sera. The I-1 protein was synthesized as a 12 kDa non-phosphorylated PEDV-specific protein that was not present in detectable amounts in virions. However, a low copy number of I-1 in the virion would suggest it is a structural component. Nevertheless, identical nucleotide sequences and gene expression strategies of attenuated ca virus and its virulent parent, wt PEDV, demonstrate that the 3' 1800 nucleotides or the genes and gene products encoded therein may not contribute to virus attenuation.

The serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 of pneumonic plague patients were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 was the only elevated cytokine in the patients, and its level increased with a clear time course, indicating that IL-6 might be a prognostic marker for predicting the progression of plague.

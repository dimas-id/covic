Relation extraction methods based on domain adaptation have begun to be extensively applied in specific domains to alleviate the pressure of insufficient annotated corpus, which enables learning by utilizing the training data set of a related domain. However, the negative transfer may occur during the adaptive process due to differences in data distribution between domains. Besides, it is difficult to achieve a fine-grained alignment of relation category without fully mining the multi-mode data structure. Furthermore, as a common application scenario, partial domain adaptation (PDA) refers to domain adaptive behavior when the relation class set of a specific domain is a subset of the related domain. In this case, some outliers belonging to the related domain will reduce the performance of the model. To solve these problems, a novel model based on a multi-adversarial module for partial domain adaptation (MAPDA) is proposed in this study. We design a weight mechanism to mitigate the impact of noise samples and outlier categories, and embed several adversarial networks to realize various category alignments between domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance of relation extraction implemented in domain adaptation.

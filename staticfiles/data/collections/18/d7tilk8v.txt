Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a rare and potentially fatal condition characterized by excessive activation and uncontrolled proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to overwhelming systemic inflammation and cytokine release. MAS has been reported with viral infections, autoimmune disorders, malignancies, and medications. We describe a case of a patient with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) treated with adalimumab, who presented with MAS.

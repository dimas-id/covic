INTRODUCTION Many studies have reported increased intimal thickness around the catheter tip after catheterization. Caveolin-1 is a protein in the endothelial cell that acts as a shear sensor causing vascular remodeling. This study aimed to elucidate the suitability of different catheter locations and determine the role of caveolin-1 in canine models. MATERIALS AND METHODS Tunneled silicone 14.5-F catheters were inserted into the left jugular vein and right femoral vein in 8 dogs. The dogs were separated into 2 groups by catheter location and were followed up for 28 days. All dogs underwent extracorporeal circulation 3 times a week. After animal sacrifice, histological and immunohistochemical assays were performed to measure specific cell populations. RESULTS There were higher catheter dysfunction rates and lower blood flow rates in the right femoral vein group compared to the left jugular vein group. There was intimal hyperplasia around the catheter tip in both groups with no significant difference between the two groups. There were caveolin-1 expression in the intimal layer of venous wall around the catheter tip location sites in both groups. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that different catheter tip locations may influence catheter function and specific targeting of caveonlin-1 could be a strategy of possible future novel therapies for catheter-related vein stenosis.

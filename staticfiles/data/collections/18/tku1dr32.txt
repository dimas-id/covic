Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the first major zoonotic infectious disease of the twenty-first century. The disease, originally termed “atypical pneumonia,” was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5 months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of the SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections was most likely originated from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets being considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to have prevented further outbreaks in the region. Further epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV, and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data accumulated indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus–host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter will focus on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.

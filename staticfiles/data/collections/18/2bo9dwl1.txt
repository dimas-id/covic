Human bocavirus (HBoV) infection is reported worldwide and may cause severe respiratory tract infections. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of HBoV, and other respiratory viral pathogens, in a 2‐year retrospective study of children admitted to hospital, and to investigate whether viral loads of HBoV DNA were associated with severity of infection. Between April 2007 and March 2009, 891 respiratory samples from 760 children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infection were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses by real‐time PCR or direct immunofluorescence testing. HBoV DNA was detected by using internally controlled real‐time quantitative PCR assay and 25 samples selected at random were sequenced. The virus detected most frequently was rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, HBoV, and human metapneumovirus. HBoV DNA was detected in 18.4% of children admitted to hospital. HBoV was the only viral pathogen detected in 66/164 (40.2%) of HBoV DNA‐positive children and in 7.4% of all 891 samples. Ninety‐seven percent (64/66) of children with an HBoV single infection were diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infection. Median HBoV DNA viral load was significantly higher in children when HBoV was detected as a single pathogen. Higher HBoV DNA viral loads were associated with prematurity and age. HBoV seems to be an important and frequent pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children, and it is likely that the severity of illness is comparable to the severity of RSV illness. J. Med.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopy was initially considered to be a risky procedure for rectal cancer patients, especially patients with an increased body weight. The literature is scarce regarding the effects of obesity on laparoscopic rectal surgery. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effect of an increased body mass index (BMI) on outcome of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic rectal resection were allocated to one of three groups according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI < 25), overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30) and obese (BMI ≥ 30). These three groups were compared with each other in terms of patient demographics, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications and histopathological data. RESULTS There were 100 patients operated on for rectal cancer. The median BMI of the patients was 27 (range 18.5-40) kg/m(2), and 43, 43 and 14 patients were classified as normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively. The conversion rate was 4.7% in the overweight group and 0% in the other groups. The proportion of complications and oncological outcomes between the groups showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Apparently, increased BMI is not a contraindication for laparoscopic rectal surgery.

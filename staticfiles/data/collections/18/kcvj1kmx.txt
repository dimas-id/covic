This pandemic phenomenon has generated a large number of publications (19 May in Pubmed 2267), all of them aimed a better knowledge of its microbiological and serological characteristics, clinical expressions, and complications, trying to find those situations that could be more serious indicators. The search for these characteristics does not escape the oral sphere. Our group had the opportunity to find the cases presented and the only thing we tried to do was to shed some light on the fact that oral lesions may be part of the syndromic complex that causes COVID-19. We were extremely carefully with our words when we reported lesions associated with COVID-19 disease, and not due to it.

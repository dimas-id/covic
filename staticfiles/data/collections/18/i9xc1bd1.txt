Although the number of deaths from stroke has declined substantially since the 1960s, in 2004, stroke remained the third leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease and cancer. Approximately 54% of U.S. stroke deaths in 2004 occurred outside of a hospital. Intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator has clinical benefits for patients with acute ischemic stroke; however, treatment should begin within 3 hours of symptom onset for these benefits to be realized. For hemorrhagic stroke, immediate surgery (e.g., aneurysm repair) is crucial to prevent rebleeding that results in serious impairment or death in 40% to 60% of cases. A revised objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase to 83% the proportion of persons who are aware of the warning symptoms of stroke and the need to telephone 9-1-1 immediately if someone appears to be having a stroke (objective no. 12-8). To assess public awareness of stroke warning symptoms and the importance of seeking emergency care, CDC analyzed data from an optional module of the 2005 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey that was used in 13 states and the District of Columbia (DC). The results indicated that the percentages of respondents who recognized all five correct symptoms, identified an incorrect symptom, and recognized the need to telephone 9-1-1 was low; the percentage who met all three measures was 16.4%. In addition, disparities were observed by race/ethnicity, sex, and education level. Public health agencies, clinicians, and educators should continue to stress the importance of learning to recognize stroke symptoms and the need to telephone 9-1-1 when someone appears to be having a stroke.

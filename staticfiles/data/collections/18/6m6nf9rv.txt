Assessment and quantification of feature uncertainty in modeling gait pattern is crucial in clinical decision making. Automatic diagnostic systems for Cerebral Palsy gait often ignored the uncertainty factor while recognizing the gait pattern. In addition, they also suffer from limited clinical interpretability. This study establishes a low-cost data acquisition set up and proposes a state-space model where the temporal evolution of gait pattern was recognized by analyzing the feature uncertainty using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. An attempt was also made to quantify the degree of abnormality by proposing gait deviation indexes. Results indicate that our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art with an overall [Formula: see text] of detection accuracy (sensitivity [Formula: see text], and specificity [Formula: see text]). In a gait cycle of a Cerebral Palsy patient, first double limb support and left single limb support were observed to be affected mainly. Incorporation of feature uncertainty in quantifying the degree of abnormality is demonstrated to be promising. Larger value of feature uncertainty was observed for the patients having higher degree of abnormality. Sub-phase wise assessment of gait pattern improves the interpretability of the results which is crucial in clinical decision making.

We describe the synthesis of the dip (di-picolyl-carboxylate) bifunctional chelator system, capable of fast coordination of Cu(2+), (64)Cu(2+) and Co(2+), as well as the [M(CO)(3)](+)-core (M = (99m)Tc, Re); it displays a variety of binding modes--tridentate when protected, tetradentate when deprotected. Syntheses of both the benzyl-nitro derivative and the benzyl-amino derivatives are described. The latter was coupled to biotin to show the viability of the system for functionalization with biomolecules. Besides coordination chemistry with stable isotopes, we also present labelling data with (64)Cu and (99m)Tc, as well as in vitro stability studies.

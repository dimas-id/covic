BACKGROUND: Rabies is a severe epidemic in Guangxi province, China, with hundreds of deaths occurring each year. In the past six decades, rabies has emerged three times in Guangxi, and the province has reported the largest number of rabies cases in China. The domestic dog is the principal vector for rabies, and 95% of human cases are associated with transmission from dogs. RESULTS: To understand the genetic relationship between street rabies virus (RABV) from Guangxi, genetic diversity analysis was performed using RABV isolates collected between 1999 and 2012. The N gene of 42 RABV isolates, and the P and M genes, as well as fragments of the 3′ terminus (L(1–680)) and the polymerase activity module of the L gene (L(pam)) of 36 RABV isolates were sequenced. In addition, whole genome sequencing was performed for 5 RABV isolates. There was evidence of topological discrepancy in the phylogenetic trees based on different genes of the RABV isolates. Amino acid variation of the deduced N protein exhibited different patterns to those obtained from the P and M proteins reported here, and the previously reported G protein (Tang H. et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis, 8(10): e3114, 2014), and L(1–680) and L(pam). These RABV isolates were divided into three main branches against fixed strains. CONCLUSION: RABV is prevalent in Guangxi province and strains collected over the last two decades belong mainly to three groups (I, II, III). These RABV isolates reveal genetic diversity. Individual RABV genes from Guangxi exhibit different evolutionary characteristics. The results will have benefits for continuing comprehensive rabies surveillance, prevention and control in China.

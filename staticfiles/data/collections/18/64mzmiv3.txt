The focus of this paper is to design and develop a Peer-to-Peer Presentation System (P2P-PS) that supports E-learning through live media streaming coupled with a P2P shared whiteboard. The participants use the “ask doubt” feature to raise and resolve doubts during a session of ongoing presentation. The proposed P2P-PS system preserves causality between ask doubt and its resolution while disseminating them to all the participants. A buffered approach is employed to enhance the performance of P2P shared whiteboard, which may be used either in tandem with live media streaming or in standalone mode. The proposed system further extends P2P interactions on stored contents (files) built on top of a P2P file sharing and searching module with additional features. The added features allow the creation of mash-up presentations with annotations, posts, comments on audio, video, and PDF files as well as a discussion forum. We have implemented the P2P file sharing and searching system on the de Bruijn graph-based overlay for low latency. Extensive experiments were carried out on Emulab to validate the P2P-PS system using 200 physical nodes.

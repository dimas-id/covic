We report here the clinical and immunological findings in two patients with molluscum contagiosum poxvirus infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). These cases support earlier evidence that the molluscum contagiosum virus may act as an opportunistic pathogen. There is now evidence that members of all five families of double stranded DNA‚Äêcontaining human viruses have been associated with unusual clinical manifestations in AIDS patients, and the significance of DNA virus infections in patients with AIDS is discussed.

A scheme was worked out for the obtaining of purified Corona viruses from fecal extracts, which include: centrifugation in an discontinued gradient of sucrose 20--45 per cent, gel filtration through a Sephadex 4B column, and centrifugation in a linear gradient of sucrose 10--50 per cent. By means of such purification the virions remain morphologically intact in sucrose density of 1.11--1.14 gr/cm3, containing no ballast proteins. As many as five polypeptides are demonstrated in polyacrylamide electrophoresis.

Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs, both transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal (TEP), are associated with peritoneal defects or tears. Nonclosure of the tears can lead to bowel obstruction. I present a case of an early (48 h) bowel obstruction related to a peritoneal defect post TAPP inguinal hernia repair. The literature on peritoneal closure and bowel obstruction related to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is reviewed as well as options for repairing defects.

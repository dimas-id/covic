INTRODUCTION Among the surgical procedures for treatment of morbid obesity, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has known widespread diffusion in the last years, although it is not free from significant morbidity rates. Aim of this work is to evaluate the incidence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection on the postoperative outcome of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2013, 184 patients (65 males, 119 females), mean age 35.8 ± 5.7 years, affected with morbid obesity, mean BMI 46.6 ± 6.7, underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. All the specimens at the end of the operation were analysed by the same pathologist. Histological grading was based on the Sidney classification. RESULTS Seventy-two of the patients (39.1%) were HP positive, while 112 (60.9%) were negative. No significant differences were observed between the HP+ and HP- group in terms of age, sex, weight, BMI, incidence of comorbidities and duration of follow-up. All the operations were completed via laparoscopic approach. No mortality was observed. Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (2.7%): three leaks (1.6%), all in the HP- group and two bleedings (1.1%), one in the HP+ and one in the HP- group. In two cases a reintervention was necessary. No significant differences were observed in the morbidity rates between the two groups. Overall mean excess weight loss at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months was respectively 47.4 ± 11.3%, 61.1 ± 12.4% and 68.4 ± 13.5%, with no significant differences between the HP+ and HP- groups. CONCLUSIONS HP infection seems not to influence postoperative outcome of patients operated of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intracranial aneurysm treatment with flow diverters has shown satisfying results in terms of aneurysm occlusion, and while some cases of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage have been described, no systematic analysis of the risk factors affecting its occurrence has been conducted in a large series of patients. This retrospective analysis of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage after flow-diverter treatment is a multicenter, retrospective study using a large series of treated patients to analyze factors affecting the occurrence of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients treated with flow diverters and presenting with delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage were included from December 2007 to December 2014 in 7 participating centers in France. Patient and aneurysm characteristics were recorded as were characteristics of bleeding (size, lateralization, and time to bleed), treatment, and clinical outcome after 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS Delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurred in 11 patients between 1 and 21 days after the procedure. In 10 of these patients, hemorrhages were ipsilateral to the treated aneurysms. Five of the 11 underwent surgery, and 9 of the 11 had good clinical outcomes at 6 months (mRS â‰¤2). CONCLUSIONS The pathogenesis of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurring after flow-diverter treatment remains unclear. The multidisciplinary management of delayed intraparenchymal hemorrhage yields a relatively low morbidity-mortality rate compared with the initial clinical presentation.

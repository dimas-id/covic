BACKGROUND: Redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and its optimal timing remains controversial. Hence, here we reviewed the early and midterm results of simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery in patients at high risk. METHODS: A total of 32 consecutive patients underwent a redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery using minimally invasive, beating-heart technique through a right lateral thoracotomy in our center between June 2016 and April 2020. The mean age of patients was 57.4 ± 8.3 years, and 18 patients (56.3%) were women. The mean preoperative EuroSCORE was 7.8 ± 1.4 (range: 6–11). Follow-up was 87.1% complete, with a mean duration of 26.3 ± 12.3 months. RESULTS: Both in-hospital and 30-day mortalities were 3.1%. Tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis was performed in 30 patients (93.8%), and the remaining two patients (6.2%) underwent tricuspid repair (annuloplasty and leaflet reconstruction). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 81.5 ± 29.0 min. The overall in-hospital duration and intensive care unit (ICU) times were 13.6 ± 7.6 days and 4.1 ± 2.8 days, respectively. Postoperative complications included prolonged ventilation in six patients (18.8%), acute kidney injury in three patients (9.4%), and neurologic event, wound infection, or permanent third-degree atrioventricular block, in one patient (3.1%) each. A total of 96.9% patients were discharged uneventfully. Four patients were lost to follow-up; there were no midterm deaths in patients who were followed up. CONCLUSIONS: Simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo tricuspid valve surgery is both feasible and safe, and the early and midterm results are excellent.

Esophageal cancer is an uncommon but highly lethal disease. Surgical resection is the gold standard of treatment for early-stage disease. Traditional surgical approach entailed significant convalescence, hospital stay, and morbidity and mortality. Transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) involves blind dissection of the esophagus with minimal mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Integration of robotic surgery is an alternate platform for minimally invasive approach while maintaining safety and following oncologic principles. We review our technique for minimally invasive THE using robotic technology, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of robotic technology surgery. We present a retrospective review of a single surgeon's data of patients treated with robotic-assisted THE, with a chart review to evaluate pathology, adequacy of surgical resection, nodal harvest, and perioperative course. Robotic THE (rTHE) shows promise as a valid option for esophageal resection, including premalignant and advanced stages of cancer. Adequate transhiatal mediastinal nodal resection can be performed with the robot.

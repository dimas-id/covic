Parasitic diseases generally develop chronically, and most patients experience non-specific symptoms and show unobvious physical signs. Except medical history and physical examination, the diagnosis is mainly based on the laboratory tests. The commonly applied laboratory tests for the diagnosis of parasitic diseases include etiological examination, immunological assay and molecular biological examination.

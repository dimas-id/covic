BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Despite evidence that primary stroke center (PSC) certification is associated with improvements in care and outcome, only a minority of hospitals have achieved this certification. We sought to determine hospital-based factors associated with achievement of PSC certification. METHODS We used the 2011 American Hospital Association survey and the 2010 national census for population and household data to identify potential hospital and demographic factors influencing certification as a PSC by the Joint Commission, Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, and DNV Healthcare. RESULTS Of the 3696 hospitals to complete the survey, 3069 fulfilling study criteria included 908 PSC (31%) and 2161 non-PSC. Independent hospital characteristics associated with PSC certification were Joint Commission accreditation (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4-5.0), increasing size (per quartile in number of beds; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.1-3.1) and inpatient neurological services (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.4-4.6), number of households per zip code (per 1000 households; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2), increasing Hispanic population (by 10% increase; OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2), and income per household (per $10 000; OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3). Designation as a sole community provider (OR, 0.22; 0.10-0.47) or governmental hospital control (0.61; 0.44-0.84) was associated with noncertification. CONCLUSIONS Less than 1 in 3 hospitals has achieved certification as an PSC. Potential areas of improvement include increasing certification of governmental-controlled hospitals.

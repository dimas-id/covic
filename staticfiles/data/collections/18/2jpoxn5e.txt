The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is overwhelming healthcare resources and infrastructure worldwide. Earlier reports have demonstrated complicated postoperative courses and high fatality rates in patients undergoing emergent cardiothoracic surgery who were diagnosed postoperatively with COVID-19. These reports raise the possibility that active COVID-19 might precipitate a catastrophic pathophysiological response to infection in the postoperative period and lead to unfavorable surgical outcomes. Hence, it is imperative to screen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection before surgery and to carefully monitor them in the postoperative period to identify any signs of active COVID-19. In this report, we present the successful outcome of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operation in a patient with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with an acute coronary syndrome and requiring urgent surgical intervention. We employed a thorough strategy to identify subclinical COVID-19 disease, and after confirming the absence of active disease, proceeded with the CABG operation. The patient outcome was successful with the absence of any overt COVID-19 manifestations in the postoperative period.

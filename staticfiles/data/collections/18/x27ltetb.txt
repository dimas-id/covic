A 78-year-old woman was admitted to another hospital with vomiting. Chest X-ray showed an abnormal shadow in the lower right lung field, and CT indicated a Morgagni hernia containing the stomach and transverse colon. The patient was transferred to our hospital and underwent laparoscopic surgery. After the hernia contents were repositioned into the abdominal cavity, we repaired the hernia orifice with a prosthetic mesh to achieve a tension-free repair. There were no complications after the surgery, and there has been no recurrence. The patient has remained free of clinical symptoms since 10 months after the surgery. Laparoscopic repair with a prosthetic mesh for Morgagni hernia is a simple and safety procedure for elderly patients.

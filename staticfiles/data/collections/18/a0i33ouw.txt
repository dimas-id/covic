For various end-stage lung diseases, lung transplantation remains one of the only viable treatment options. While the demand for lung transplantation has steadily risen over the last few decades, the availability of donor grafts is limited, which have resulted in progressively longer waiting lists. In the early years of lung transplantation, only the ‘ideal’ donor grafts are considered for transplantation. Due to the donor shortages, there is ongoing discussion about the safe use of ‘suboptimal’ grafts to expand the donor pool. In this review, we will discuss the considerations around donor selection, donor-recipient matching, graft preparation and graft optimisation.

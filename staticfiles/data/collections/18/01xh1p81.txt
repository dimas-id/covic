Performing emergency endotracheal intubation necessarily means doing so under less than ideal conditions. Rates of first-time success will be lower than endotracheal intubation performed under controlled conditions in the operating room. Some factors associated with improved success are predictable and can be modified to improve outcome. Factors to be discussed include the initial decision to perform endotracheal intubation in out-of-hospital settings, qualifications and training of providers performing intubation, the technique selected for advanced airway management, and the use of sedatives and neuromuscular blocking agents.

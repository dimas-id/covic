BACKGROUND quadriceps tendon subcutaneous rupture is an uncommon injury affecting predominantly middle-aged men as a result of direct or indirect trauma; aim of this work is to evaluate clinical outcome and tendon morphology in patients treated surgically with transpatellar drilling suture. METHODS 20 patients (20 male) with an average age of 54 (42-59) were evaluated with a mean follow-up of 36 months. Measurements of range of motion (ROM) and of tight circumference were collected. Lysholm and Rougraff Score were also performed. All the patients underwent a US evaluation the morphologic changes of the repaired tendon. RESULTS mean active ROM was 1°-117°; average difference in the circumference of the quadriceps was 2.6% 10 C and 3.3% 15 C. The mean Lysholm Score calculated was 88/100; the mean Rougraff Score 17/25. At ultrasonographic evaluation all tendons were continuous; heterotopic ossification was present in 18 quadriceps tendons. Thickness was augmented in 18 quadriceps tendons and in 5 patellar tendons. Vascularization was always conserved. Lateral subluxation of patella was reported in 1 case. CONCLUSIONS patellar drilling holes repair is a non-demanding procedure, inexpensive and technically uncomplicated. US evaluation confirms tendon healing; tendon remodeling does not affect patient's clinical outcome and quality of life. LEVEL OF INCIDENCE IV.

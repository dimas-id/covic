The high Mr glycoprotein (gp300) of equine herpesvirus type 1 was found to have an Mr, estimated by SDS-PAGE, of over 400,000 and was confirmed as being a surface glycoprotein by 125I-labelling. In contrast to [3H]glucosamine, gp300 showed very low levels of [3H]glucosamine, gp300 showed very low levels of [3H]mannose incorporation. The Mr of gp300 showed no detectable change upon treatment of purified virus with N-glycanase, and showed only a small change in virus-infected cells treated with tunicamycin. In addition, gp300 failed to bind the lectin concanavalin A. Taken together, these results indicate a lack of N-linked carbohydrate on gp300. The major carbohydrate species were found to be composed primarily of O-linked chains, as indicated by the sensitivity of the protein to monensin, to exoglycanase enzymes specific for sugars present in O-linked chains and to mild alkaline borohydride treatment, which revealed three species of carbohydrate of Mr of greater than 10,000, 2400 and 1100, respectively. Neuraminidase treatment and binding of Helix pomatia lectin indicated the presence of alpha-N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid as terminal sugars. Immunological cross-reactivity of gp300 with a high Mr protein of equine herpesvirus type 4 was shown and it also exhibited a marked Mr variation in the vaccine strain Rhinomune.

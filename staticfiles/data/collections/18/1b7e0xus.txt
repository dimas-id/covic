We analyzed the nucleocapsid and surface proteins from several Coronaviridae viruses using an alignment-free computer program. Three isolates of novel, human coronavirus (SARS0CoV-2) (2019) that are responsible for the current pandemic and older SARS strains of human and animal coronaviruses were examined. The nucleocapsid and glycoprotein sequences are identical for the three novel 2019 human isolates and they are closely related to these sequences in six bat and human SARS coronaviruses. This strongly supports the bat origin of the pandemic, novel coronavirus. One surface glycoprotein fragment of 111 amino acids is the largest, conserved, common permutation in the examined bat SARS-like and human SARS viruses, including the Covid-19 virus. BLAST analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat SARS strains. This fragment likely is involved in infectivity and is of interest for vaccine development. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein sequence homologies of 58.9% and 82.5%, respectively, between the novel SARS0CoV-2 strains and the human SARS (2018) virus suggest that existing anti-SARS vaccines may provide some protection against the novel coronavirus.

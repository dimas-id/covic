In the past 5 years, with the introduction of new techniques and dedicated materials, endovascular recanalization of distal tibial and pedal vessels has become a valid alternative to inframalleolar bypass for limb salvage in patients with severe arterial occlusive disease, particularly diabetics. Revascularization of the foot is now often performed by using percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; over a 4-year period, the authors performed more than 2500 antegrade interventional procedures in patients with critical limb ischemia, diabetes, and infrainguinal arterial disease. Intraprocedural angiography of the foot is crucial for successful planning and guidance of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in tibial and pedal arteries, and its effective use requires both anatomic knowledge and technical skill. To select the best revascularization strategy and obtain optimal clinical results, interventional radiologists, cardiologists, and vascular surgeons performing below-the-knee endovascular procedures also must be familiar with the functional aspects of circulation in the foot.

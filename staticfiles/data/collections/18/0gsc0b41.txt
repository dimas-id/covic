The technology available for the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms is rapidly evolving. Both current and future devices are described. This includes, among others, UNO for parent vessel occlusion, the Medina device for saccular filling, the Comaneci device for remodeling, pCONus for assisted coil occlusion, and WEB and pCANvas for intrasaccular flow disruption. Perspectives of further development such as surface coating for increased radioopacity and decreased thrombogenicity are explained.

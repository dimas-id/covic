Abstract This chapter focuses on the synthesis, functionalization, and applications of metallic, semiconductor, magnetic, and multifunctional nanoparticles. Synthesis methods such as chemical reduction, coprecipitation, seeding, microemulsion, hydrothermal synthesis, and sonoelectrodeposition are outlined. Functionalized nanoparticles are suitable for numerous applications. Several applications of nanoparticles in life sciences and the enviromment are discussed. Finally, some future trends are pointed out.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with abnormal inflammatory response and airflow limitation. Acute exacerbation involves increased inflammatory burden leading to worsening respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea and sputum production. Some COPD patients have frequent exacerbations (two or more exacerbations per year). A substantial proportion of COPD patients may remain stable without exacerbation. Bacterial and viral infections are the most common causative factors that breach airway stability and lead to exacerbation. The increasing prevalence of exacerbation is associated with deteriorating lung function, hospitalization, and risk of death. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms of airway inflammation in COPD and discuss how bacterial or viral infection, temperature, air pollution, eosinophilic inflammation, and concomitant chronic diseases increase airway inflammation and the risk of exacerbation.

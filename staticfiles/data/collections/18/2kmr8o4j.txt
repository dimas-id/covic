BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The WEB Occlusion Score has been proposed to assess angiographic outcomes for intracranial aneurysms treated with the Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device. Using a large series of experimental aneurysms treated with the WEB, we had the following objectives: 1) to compare angiographic outcomes as measured by the WEB Occlusion Scale with histologic results, and 2) to assess interobserver and intraobserver agreement of the WEB Occlusion Scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS Intracranial aneurysms were created in 80 rabbits and treated with WEB devices. Animals were sacrificed at last follow-up for histologic evaluation. DSA was performed just after the deployment of the device and at follow-up. Four investigators independently and retrospectively graded the DSA twice according to the WEB Occlusion Scale. One histopathologist blinded to the angiographic results graded the occlusion according to a 4-point scale patterned on the WEB Occlusion Scale. Intra- and interobserver agreement were evaluated for DSA. Follow-up angiographic grading and histologic reference were compared to determine the WEB Occlusion Scale accuracy for complete (with or without recess filling) versus incomplete occlusion and adequate (complete occlusion or neck remnant) versus inadequate occlusion. RESULTS Inter- and intraobserver weighted Îº for the angiographic WEB Occlusion Scale were, respectively, 0.76 and 0.76, indicating substantial agreement. The sensitivity and specificity of the WEB Occlusion Scale for complete occlusion at follow-up compared with the histologic reference standard were, respectively, 75% and 83.3%, with an overall accuracy of 80%. Similarly, for adequate occlusion at follow-up, sensitivity was 97.7%, specificity was 64.9%, and overall accuracy was 82.5%. CONCLUSIONS The WEB Occlusion Scale appears to be consistent, reliable, and accurate compared with a histologic reference standard.

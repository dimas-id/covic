The understanding of epidemics on networks has greatly benefited from the recent application of message-passing approaches, which allow us to derive exact results for irreversible spreading (i.e., diseases with permanent acquired immunity) in locally treelike topologies. This success has suggested the application of the same approach to recurrent-state epidemics, for which an individual can contract the epidemic and recover repeatedly. The underlying assumption is that backtracking paths (i.e., an individual is reinfected by a neighbor he or she previously infected) do not play a relevant role. In this paper we show that this is not the case for recurrent-state epidemics since the neglect of backtracking paths leads to a formula for the epidemic threshold that is qualitatively incorrect in the large size limit. Moreover, we define a modified recurrent-state dynamics which explicitly forbids direct backtracking events and show that this modification completely upsets the phenomenology.

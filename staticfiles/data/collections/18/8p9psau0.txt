In a short span of a few weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world like no other event in modern history. Healthcare institutions and providers have been at the forefront of containing the ravages of this disease, and are experiencing unprecedented challenges. Medical decision making has become all the more complex because of the moral weight of difficult decisions that need to be made. This paper discusses three areas where ethical decision making is extremely important: dealing with those patients with COVID-19 who no longer have access to their doctors; following ethical criteria for assigning risky duties to healthcare professionals; and in making life and death decisions while allocating scarce resources. This paper describes a national level guidance document for the COVID-19 pandemic that is designed to facilitate ethical decision-making.

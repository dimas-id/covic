BACKGROUND Recent studies have reported trocar site hernia (TSH) rates after bariatric surgery ranging from 0 to 45.2% based on imaging assessment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the TSH rate after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) comprising routine 12 mm epigastric trocar site closure (TSC). MATERIAL Prospective observational study with retrospective control cohort of a group of patients undergoing primary SG with routine 12 mm epigastric TSC. The "before" group (control group) was a previously published group of patients without 12 mm epigastric TSC and the "after" group (closure group) concerned patients with routine 12 mm epigastric TSC. Primary endpoint was the TSH rate after routine epigastric TSC. Secondary endpoints were comparison of the TSH rate, TSC feasibility and causes of failure, TSC-related morbidity, evaluation of TSC time and its course, and identification of risk factors for TSH. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients were analyzed during the study period. Feasibility of epigastric TSC was 97.3% without related morbidity. Mean epigastric TSC time was 44.2 s (18-150). Epigastric TSC time was always less than 60 s after 10-15 procedures. At 1 year, 10 patients presented TSH (8.1%): epigastric in 6.5% (n = 8) cases and after open laparoscopy in 1.6% (n = 2) cases. Comparison of the two groups revealed a lower TSH rate in the closure group (8.1% vs. 17.0%; p = 0.02), due to a lower epigastric TSH rate (6.5% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.02). Routine epigastric TSC was a protective factor for TSH (p = 0.03; relative risk of 0.43). CONCLUSION Routine epigastric TSC during SG is rapid and provides effective prevention of TSH.

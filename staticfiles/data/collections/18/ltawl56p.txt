A herd of sixty-two veal calves was studied to determine whether there was a relationship between neonatal diarrhoea and infections with rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Salmonella and K99-positive E. coli. Examination of the animals was negative for salmonellosis. Clinical findings and serological testing did not suggest that K99-positive E. coli was a factor in aetiology. Bovine coronavirus was isolated from the faeces of a small number of calves, only a few of which were affected with diarrhoea. A few faecal samples were found to harbour bovine coronavirus as well as rotavirus. Rotavirus was isolated from the faeces of a large number of calves; excretion of the virus was only associated with diarrhoea in some cases. A definite conclusion could therefore not be drawn from the findings, although they suggested a possible role of rotavirus in the aetiology of neonatal diarrhoea of veal calves.

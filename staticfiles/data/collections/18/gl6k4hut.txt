We are not all in this together. My 32-year history with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States-initially as an HIV/AIDS policy analyst and now as an HIV-prevention researcher-has provided the dubitable opportunity to witness how adroitly deadly viruses spotlight fissures of structural inequality. In the late 1980s, "changing face" was the term often used to describe the epidemic's transition from one that affected predominantly White and class-privileged gay and bisexual men to one that exacted a disproportionate toll on people at the most marginalized demographic intersections: Black and Latinx gay and bisexual men, cisgender and transgender women, injection drug users, and poor people.

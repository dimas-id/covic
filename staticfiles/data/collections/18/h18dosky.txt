Abstract The electrocatalytic performance of tungsten-based compounds was significantly enhanced via the crystal facets engineering, defect tuning, and combination with conductive 2D materials. Stating from Na2WO4·2H2O and CoCl2·6H2O we synthesized two types of nano-CoWO4 with different morphologies. The products were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, HRTEM, XPS and EDS in details. The electrochemical performance of CoWO4 nanorods was obviously superior to CoWO4 nanodots due to the enhanced electrochemical active areas. Furthermore, CoWO4 and nitrogen-doped graphene oxides (NGO) composites were obtained under the similar synthetic conditions. As expected, the CoWO4/NGO composites showed significant improvement on electrochemical properties.

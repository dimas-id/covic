In this paper, an age-structured epidemic model for coupling within-host and between-host dynamics in environmentally-driven infectious diseases is investigated. The model is described by a mixed system of ordinary and partial differential equations which is constituted by the within-host virus infectious fast time ordinary system and the between-host disease transmission slow time age-structured system. The isolated fast system has been investigated in previous literatures, and the main results are introduced. For the isolated slow system, the basic reproduction number R(b0), the positivity and ultimate boundedness of solutions are obtained, the existence of equilibria, the local stability of equilibria, and the global stability of disease-free equilibrium are established. We see that when R(b0) â‰¤ 1 the system only has the disease-free equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable, and when R(b0) > 1 the system has a unique endemic equilibrium which is local asymptotically stable. With regard to the coupled slow system, the basic reproduction number R(b), the positivity and boundedness of solutions and the existence of equilibria are firstly obtained. Particularly, the coupled slow system can exist two positive equilibria when R(b) < 1 and a unique endemic equilibrium when R(b) > 1. When R(b) < 1 the disease-free equilibrium is local asymptotically stable, and when R(b) > 1 and an additional condition is satisfied the unique endemic equilibrium is local asymptotically stable. When there exist two positive equilibria, under an additional condition the local asymptotic stability of a positive equilibrium and the instability of other positive equilibrium also are established. The numerical examples show that the additional condition may be removed. The research shows that the coupled slow age-structured system has more complex dynamical behavior than the corresponding isolated slow system.

Rosé veal is understood as meat from male purebred dairy calves. The UK veal market is limited, and calves are often killed at birth due to lack of purpose. A questionnaire, completed by 1002 respondents, investigated the UK public knowledge, perceptions and opinions of rosé veal, and whether raising awareness would sustain the rosé veal market. Most respondents (66%) did not eat rosé veal, mainly due to limited availability or exposure (31%) and animal welfare concerns (17%). A third of respondents knew the differences between rosé and white veal. After defining this, 61% of respondents would eat rosé veal, compared to 23% of respondents who ate it beforehand. Most respondents (91%) were willing to pay more for rosé veal burgers than the proposed average price for beef burgers. Increasing availability is key to encourage the sustainability of rosé veal production in the UK. These findings are useful for dairy farmers to strategically promote the use of purebred dairy bull calves.

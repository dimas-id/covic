A healthy patient presented to Klinikum Altmühlfranken Weißenburg Hospital, Germany, with two morning attacks of painful muscle spasm in the left upper and lower limbs, without altered consciousness. Full examinations, radiological imaging, electroencephalography, lumbar puncture, and autoimmune profile were either normal or not consistent with patient's complaint. Subsequent epileptic episodes were observed on admission day and the following days; thus, the patient was diagnosed with focal epilepsy. The patient started to develop a fever and severe cough on day 4, and SARS-coronavirus-2 was confirmed through a nasopharyngeal swap. She received anticonvulsants and symptomatic treatments and completely recovered. This report emphasizes the potential nervous system involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 pathogenesis.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has driven a global research effort to identify medical countermeasures at an unprecedented pace. In this issue of Cell, Cao et al. identify thousands of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from convalescent donors. The authors improve our understanding of immunity against the coronavirus spike glycoprotein and detail novel pathways to rapidly identify and characterize protective monoclonal antibodies.

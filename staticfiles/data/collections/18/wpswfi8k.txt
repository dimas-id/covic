Polyketides (PKs) are secondary metabolites with valuable properties, including antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, and immunosuppressive activity. The biosynthesis of PKs is accomplished by multifunctional megaenzymes, the polyketide synthases (PKSs). The molecular architecture of those remarkable assembly lines provides opportunities for their engineering and generation of PK derivatives with potentially improved pharmacokinetics and/or expanded spectrum of bioactivity.

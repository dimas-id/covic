The last three months have been the most memorable and the most tense period in the lives of the most of us. After Taking Wuhan (China) by storm, the coronavirus crossed all of the frontiers and reached to 202 countries, including the East Asian countries, Middle East, the Americas and then the European countries. The Netherlands was effected less, with about 1000 deaths and more than 12000 confirmed patients, than its neighbors â€“ Italy and Spain, but had its share. This manuscript presents an outline of the public perceptions, and the guidelines to manage these patients at different stages of the disease, including ventilation and intubation protocols, based upon our experience of over two months. It does not claim to be complete and exhaustive, and the readers are directed to consult their National guidelines (if any).

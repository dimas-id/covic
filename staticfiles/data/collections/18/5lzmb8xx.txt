The important roles of the spike protein and other structural proteins in murine coronavirus (MHV) pathogenesis have been demonstrated; however, the role of the replicase gene remains unexplored. We assessed the influence of the replicase genes of the highly neurovirulent MHV-JHM strain and the hepatotropic and mildly neurovirulent A59 strain in acute infection of the mouse. Analysis of chimeric A59/JHM recombinant viruses indicates that the replicase genes are interchangeable and that it is the 3' end of the genome, encoding the structural proteins, rather than the replicase gene, that determines the pathogenic properties of these chimeras.

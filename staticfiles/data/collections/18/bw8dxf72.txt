Travelers are known to convey infectious diseases across international borders. After its experience with SARS, Taiwan established a comprehensive mechanism at its border to prevent the entry of infectious diseases. However, people with chronic infectious diseases, carriers with no symptoms, and those likely to be infected are not easy to identify during border screenings. Therefore, Taiwan must implement internal disease-containment measures in addition to stopping infectious disease at its borders. With increasing numbers of patients coming to Taiwan for medical examinations, medical aesthetic treatments, and medical treatments and care, the risk of acute, chronic, and contagious diseases originating from non-residents must be considered and addressed. This article was developed to discuss the role and importance of nurses in preventing transnational infectious diseases from the perspective of international medical care. In addition to showing rich nursing experience, sensitivity, and conducting the management and communication of international cases, it is also necessary to make good use of information tools for remote screening care. Taking the period of the COVID-19 outbreak as an example, several procedures have been conducted. First, online detailed history of infectious diseases and nursing evaluations are conducted before admission. Second, preparation and movement notifications are given before admission. Third, online health education and follow-up care as well as cross-unit communication and coordination are implemented. International medical nurses directly affect the quality and effectiveness of international medical treatment. As Taiwan builds up its brand as an international medical caring destination, nursing professionals should help further this trend and announce to the world: Taiwan can help! Nursing can help!

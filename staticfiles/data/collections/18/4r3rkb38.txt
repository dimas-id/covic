With the advent of substantial intercontinental air travel, it is possible for diseases to move from one location to a completely separate location very rapidly. This was an essential aspect of modeling SARS during the epidemic of 2002â€“2003, and has become a very important part of the study of the spread of epidemics. Mathematically, it has led to the study of metapopulation models or models with patchy environments and movement between patches.

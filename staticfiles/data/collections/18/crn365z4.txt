BACKGROUND Innovations in surgical strategies and technologies have facilitated laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD). However, data regarding the short-term and long-term results of LPD are sparse, and this procedure is the primary focus of the current study. METHODS Between October 2010 and October 2013, a total of 31 consecutive patients received LPD, including hand-assisted laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy, and laparoscopic pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Data regarding short-term surgical outcomes and long-term oncological results were collected prospectively. RESULTS The median operative time was 515.0 min (interquartile range 465.0-585.0 min). The median intraoperative estimated blood loss was 260.0 mL (interquartile range 150.0-430.0 mL). Conversion to open pancreaticoduodenectomy was required in three patients (9.7%) due to intraoperative pneumoperitoneum intolerance (n = 1, 3.2%) and tumor adherence to the superior mesenteric vein (n = 2, 6.5%). No significant differences between the surgical approaches were observed in regard to intraoperative and postoperative data. Postoperative severe complications (Clavien â‰¥ III) were detected in three (9.7%) patients, including one grade C pancreatic fistula, one grade B postoperative bleeding event, and one afferent loop obstruction. There were no deaths within 30 days following LPD. The final pathological results revealed duodenal adenocarcinoma in 14 (45.2%) patients, ampullary adenocarcinoma in four (12.9%) patients, distal common bile duct cancer in six (19.4%) patients, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in five (16.1%) patients, gastrointestinal stroma tumor in one (3.2%) patient, and chronic pancreatitis in one (3.2%) patient. All patients suffering from tumors underwent R0 resection (n = 30, 100.0%), with the optimal number of collected lymph nodes (median: 13, interquartile range 11-19). At the most recent follow-up, 20 patients were still alive, and the 1-, and 3-year overall survival for patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma were 100.0 and 71.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS According to this study, LPD is feasible and technically safe for highly selected patients and can offer acceptable oncological outcomes and long-term survival.

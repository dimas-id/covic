We describe rapid, label-free detection of Influenza A viruses using the first radial mode of oscillations of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric discs with a 2 mm radius and 100 Âµm thickness fabricated from a piezoelectric membrane. The discs are modified with a synthetic sialylglycopolymer receptor layer, and the coated discs are inserted in a flowing virus suspension. Label-free detection of the virus is achieved by monitoring the disc radial mode resonance frequency shift. Piezo transducers with sialylglycopolymer sensor layers exhibited a long lifetime, a high sensitivity and the possibility of regeneration. We demonstrate positive, label-free detection of Influenza A viruses at concentrations below 10(5) virus particles per millilitre. We show that label-free, selective, sensitive detection of influenza viruses by home appliances is possible in principle.

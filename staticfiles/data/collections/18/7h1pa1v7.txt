Dog bite injuries are common and the head and neck is most frequently involved in pediatric patients. In severe cases, the combination of crushing, tearing, and puncturing can result in scalp avulsion. Currently, microsurgical replantation of the avulsed scalp remains the gold standard but may not always be possible. The authors present their treatment algorithm with 2 patient examples. In Patient 1, the scalp was deemed unsuitable for replantation due to extensive soft tissue injury; in Patient 2, the scalp was not available on presentation. Both patients underwent debridement and early wound coverage followed by multistage secondary revision through serial tissue expansion and excision. At 3-years follow-up, both patients have achieved satisfactory aesthetic outcomes following the initial loss of 70% and 40% of hair-bearing scalp. There were no infective complications or wound dehiscence and the areas of scar alopecia are much improved with preservation of the hairline. Pediatric scalp avulsion injuries resulting from dog bites are uncommon and involve a unique injury mechanism. Coupled with the diminutive size of vessels in this patient population, replantation may be precluded altogether. A delayed and staged approach to reconstruction can restore a hair-bearing scalp for satisfactory outcomes.

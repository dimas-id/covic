This paper provides the context of COVID-19 outbreak with special reference to hospital-based neurorehabilitation services in the UK and transferrable lessons for similar services globally. While the COVID-19 pandemic has created numerous challenges at all levels and forced us to confront our own vulnerabilities as individuals, teams, services, communities and on the global stage, it has also simultaneously offered us opportunities for transformation. Converting catastrophe into opportunity requires creativity, diligence, innovation, strategy and vision. This reflection serves to identify the challenges we encountered, the solutions we applied and the opportunities that we have taken. In the wake of an information avalanche, service and clinical practice challenge, service capacity challenge and above all, a unique and timely reminder of our own humanity and the inter-connectedness and fragility of human societies, we have endeavoured to identify and describe some crucial leadership facets, which are supporting our journey through this global health crisis.

To define the origin and evolution of recent avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Japan, a genetic analysis was performed. By phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene including the sequence of the hypervariable regions, IBV isolates in Japan were classified into five genetic groups, which included two already-known groups (Mass and Gray). Among them, three major genetic groups were associated with the recent outbreaks of IB in Japan. One group is indigenous to Japan and could not be placed within the known existing groups in other countries. The remaining two groups, which have emerged recently, are related to isolates in China and Taiwan.

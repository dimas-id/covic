Objective: Based on the systematic pharmacological database of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the analysis platform TCMSP, the computer virtual screening technique was used to screen the small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase from Chinese materia medica (CMM), and speculate the potential anti-COVID-19 novel coronavirus pneumonia TCMs and its compounds. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase protein was targeted in this study. Autodock Vina software and Python script were used to realize high-throughput molecular docking. Combined with “ADME-Lipinski” rules, the re-screening was carried out to optimize the active ingredients and speculate the key TCMs and compound prescriptions. Based on the perspective of network pharmacology, a component-target-pathway network was constructed to infer the mechanism of action of core drug pairs. Results: Taking the reference ligand as positive control, 66 natural micromolecule compounds with good pharmacokinetic properties were obtained. Twelve single TCMs, two Chinese medicine pairs of Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Mori Cortex and Lonicerae Japonicae Flos-Forsythiae Fructus, and 12 TCM prescriptions including Sangju Drink and modified Sangju Drink and Yinqiao Powder were selected as candidate schemes to fight against novel coronavirus pneumonia. Conclusion: This study is based on high-throughput molecular docking technology to virtually screen small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase of CMM and Chinese medicines, innovatively analyze the potential molecular mechanism in combination with network pharmacology, and provide scientific guidance and theoretical basis for TCM to resist novel coronavirus pneumonia.

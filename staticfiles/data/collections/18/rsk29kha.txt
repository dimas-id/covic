The value of direct examination of Giemsa and Gram stains of cytospin preparations of protected specimen brush samples was compared to that of quantitative culture. Sixty-one samples from patients suspected to have nosocomial pneumonia were analysed. Twenty-five samples were positive by quantitative culture, 21 of which contained microorganisms seen by direct examination. The presence of leucocytes was not specific for a positive culture, but in their absence, a positive culture was unlikely. The presence of intracellular organisms always correlated with a positive culture, but was not very sensitive.

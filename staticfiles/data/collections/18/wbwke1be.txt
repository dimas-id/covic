The RNA polymerase gene of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) encodes a polyprotein of greater than 750 kDa. The amino-terminal cleavage product of the MHV polymerase polyprotein, p28, has been shown to be cleaved from the polyprotein by the virus-encoded protease PCP-1. We aim to identify the MHV-JHM proteolytic products downstream of p28 and to determine which viral proteinase domains are responsible for generating each of them. To this end, we have generated antisera directed at specific MHV-JHM ORF1a regions and have used these antisera to identify six viral proteins, representing a large portion of ORF1a, from MHV-JHM-infected cells. These proteins include p28, p72, p65, p250, p210, and p27.

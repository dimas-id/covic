We present an asymptomatic 70-year-old man referred for an F-FDG PET/CT for initial staging of a Hodgkin lymphoma. F-FDG PET/CT showed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy (stage II). Incidentally, the CT demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities with low-grade F-FDG activity. CT findings were suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonitis. The COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examination result was negative. Given the high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, the patient was isolated and repeat RT-PCR was positive at 72 hours. RT-PCR may be falsely negative in early COVID-19 disease, even with positive CT findings.

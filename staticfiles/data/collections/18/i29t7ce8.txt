The outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been a big problem of swine industry in China in recent years. In this study, we investigated molecular diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and protein characterization of Fujian field samples with other PEDV reference strains. Sequence analysis of the S1 and sM genes showed that each sample had unique characteristics, and the sample P55 may be differentiated from the others by the unique deletions and insertions of sM gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1 or sM gene, which have high levels of variations, indicated that each sample was related to the specific reference strain, and this finding was consistent with the protein characterization prediction analysis. The study is useful to better understand the prevalence of PEDV and its prevention and control in Fujian.

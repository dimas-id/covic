TRIM25 is a novel RNA-binding protein and a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response. Almost nothing is known about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. Here, we reveal that RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25â€™s endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. Finally, we show that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase function. These results reveal new insights into the molecular roles and characteristics of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases and demonstrate that RNA could be an essential factor for their biological functions.

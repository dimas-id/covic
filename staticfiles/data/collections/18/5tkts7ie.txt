Posttraumatic pseudoaneurysms of the lower limb are increasingly recognized due to the development of cross-sectional imaging. Two cases of anterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm after blunt trauma are presented. The diagnostic technique of choice is Doppler ultrasound (US). In some cases, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is needed to identify the feeding vessel. The treatment of choice is not yet determined. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is widely used as first-line treatment, but some cases are refractory to this treatment. Further investigation and optimization of therapeutic technique to definitely exclude the pseudoaneurysm from the circulation may result in faster and more cost-effective treatment than US-guided thrombin injection.

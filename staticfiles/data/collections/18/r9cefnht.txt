During the influenza pandemic in 2009 individuals had the choice of either receiving a vaccination or running the risk of becoming infected with the pandemic influenza virus A (H1N1). For many individuals knowledge of a likely infection and possibly serious health consequences stood in contrast to a vague fear of the vaccination itself. What has a stronger influence on the decision to be vaccinated: the cognitive estimation of risk or the feeling of risk? Based on data collected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic we tested the relative influence of the cognitive and affective aspects of risk on estimation of the individual willingness to be vaccinated. In doing so we also focused on fear. The results indicate that the feeling of risk had a significant effect on the willingness to be vaccinated. In contrast, the classic, cognitive estimation of a risk was no longer a significant predictor when the feeling of risk was also used to predict the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk to become infected with influenza A (H1N1) substantially increased the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk regarding the vaccination, on the other hand, decreased the willingness to be vaccinated. Fear of the vaccination significantly decreased the willingness to be vaccinated even when fear of the spreading disease was also very high. The implications of the results for crisis communications will also be discussed.

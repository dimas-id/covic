Community-based supports and services (CBSS) have been developing rapidly in China as a new way of satisfying the needs of elderly people. However, it is not clear how pervasive these services are or whether the availability of CBSS impacts quality of life. This study examines trends in CBSS and the impact of the perceived CBSS availability on self-reported quality of life among the elderly in China. We found a significant increase in perceived CBSS availability from 2005 to 2011, but the perceived availability of CBSS varies by the type of CBSS. Multivariate analyses show that home medical visits (β = .181, p = .03), psychological support (β = .332, p = .02), social and recreation activities (β = .231, p = .02), and legal consulting services (β = .271, p = .02) were each significantly associated with a good quality of life. Results from this study provide insight that can inform CBSS strategies and the development of new services for the elderly in China.

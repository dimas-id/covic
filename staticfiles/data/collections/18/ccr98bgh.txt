Objectives The Neuroform Atlas stent (AS) is the smallest intracranial stent with an open-cell design. This study reports the first clinical experience with AS. Methods All intracranial aneurysms treated by stent-assisted coiling using a single AS in a single institution were retrospectively evaluated. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, angles between the parent artery and stented branch, technical success, and clinical and angiographic follow-up were analyzed. Results Fifty-five consecutive aneurysms treated with AS-assisted coiling were included. Of these, 69.1% were located distal to the circle of Willis. Technical success rate was 100%. The mean diameters of proximal and distal parent arteries were 2.62 mm (range 1.5-4.4) and 1.8 mm (range 0.8-3.5), respectively. Except for a minor stroke in a patient who completely discontinued antiplatelet therapy on postoperative day 4, there were no clinical events with permanent sequelae, and 94.1% of patients had Raymond-Roy score of 1 or 2 aneurysmal occlusion at a mean follow-up duration of 7.9 months. Although the angle between the parent artery and the stented branch increased significantly ( p < 0.001) with time, the angular change at follow-up was only 16.45 Â± 11.03 degrees and was inversely correlated both with preoperative angle and the diameter of the distal parent artery ( r = -0.465 and r = -0.433, respectively, p = 0.004 for both). Conclusion AS-assisted coiling was associated with a favorable early clinical outcome and angiographic results in this series. This stent can be used for distally located aneurysms and results in minimal alteration of the arterial anatomy.

UNLABELLED Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human gammaherpesvirus with latent and lytic reactivation cycles. The mechanism by which KSHV evades the innate immune system to establish latency has not yet been precisely elucidated. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the first line of defense against viral infections. Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) is a key adaptor that interacts with all TLRs except TLR3 to produce inflammatory factors and type I interferons (IFNs), which are central components of innate immunity against microbial infection. Here, we found that KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA), which is an immediate-early master switch protein of viral cycles, downregulates MyD88 expression at the protein level by degrading MyD88 through the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. We identified the interaction between RTA and MyD88 in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated that RTA functions as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate MyD88. MyD88 also was repressed at the early stage of de novo infection as well as in lytic reactivation. We also found that RTA inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered activation of the TLR4 pathway by reducing IFN production and NF-ÎºB activity. Finally, we showed that MyD88 promoted the production of IFNs and inhibited KSHV LANA-1 gene transcription. Taken together, our results suggest that KSHV RTA facilitates the virus to evade innate immunity through the degradation of MyD88, which might be critical for viral latency control. IMPORTANCE MyD88 is an adaptor for all TLRs other than TLR3, and it mediates inflammatory factors and IFN production. Our study demonstrated that the KSHV RTA protein functions as an E3 ligase to degrade MyD88 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and block the transmission of TLRs signals. Moreover, we found that KSHV inhibited MyD88 expression during the early stage of de novo infection as well as in lytic reactivation. These results provide a potential mechanism for the virus to evade innate immunity.

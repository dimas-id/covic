This Is My Brave (TIMB) is a contact-based mental illness stigma reduction program set in theaters. A randomized controlled trial of TIMB, compared the effect of TIMB videos to a comparison and control condition video. Pre- and post-surveys (153 adults) assessed mental illness stigma, beliefs about recovery and empowerment, and willingness to seek treatment. Univariate ANCOVAs revealed participants in the TIMB video condition experienced a greater reduction in perceived difference from people with mental illnesses than the comparison and control groups. Participants in the comparison and TIMB video conditions experienced greater reductions in social distance than the control group. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants in the TIMB video condition did not endorse improved beliefs about recovery and empowerment as compared to the comparison and control groups. These findings provide evidence for TIMB as an effective program for stigma reduction, particularly reducing perceived difference from people with mental illnesses and decreasing desired social distance.

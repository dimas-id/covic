The virus that causes sialodacryoadenitis in rats has been isolated in mice and in primary cultures of rat-kidney cells and has been characterized as a heat-labile RNA virus that is sensitive to lipid solvents and is relatively stable at pH 3.0. This virus is antigenically related to the virus of hepatitis in mice and to coronavirus of rats. The range of hosts of this agent appears to be narrow. On the basis of available biologic characteristics, it has been placed in the coronavirus group.

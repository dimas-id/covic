Abstract Serum-virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum and colostrum of sows vaccinated during pregnancy with commercially available vaccines against eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV), and antibodies were detected in serum from nearly all pigs from vaccinated sows flllowing colostrum uptake. Serum-virus neutralizing antibody (SVN) test titers were measured in colostrum and pigs at the next farrowing, and additional vaccination of sows prior to the third farrowing led to elevated SVN titers in serum, colostrum and all pigs. Six pigs from vaccinated sows challenged at 8 to 9 days of age with 1 × 106 TCID50 EEEV did not develop the high temperatures or signs of central nervous system disease that 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows developed. Virus was isolated from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from all pigs from non-vaccinated sows with blood virus titers as high as 9.3 × 104 TCID50, while only low levels of virus were detected in blood and oropharyngeal swabs from pigs from vaccinated sows. Virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows. Vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical EEEV related disease after experimental challenge with EEEV. In addition, vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs.

RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon of double-stranded (ds)RNA-mediated mRNA degradation that leads to the posttranscriptional silencing of the corresponding gene. First reports on RNAi emerged in 1998, and since then, it has become one of the most fascinating fields of molecular biology. RNAi has provided important insights about the diversity of RNA molecules and their implication in many biological processes such as the regulation of developmental genes in eukaryotic organisms. Furthermore, RNAi has rapidly developed into a powerful instrument with a great potential for functional genomics and therapeutic applications by silencing normal and disease-related gene functions. To date, the use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. Despite the many unanswered questions on how this technology can be efficiently applied to humans, the development of novel approaches, such as vaccines or novel delivery agents, is certainly one of the major goals in RNAi research.

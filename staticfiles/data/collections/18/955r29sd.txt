Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Despite advances in antibiotic treatments, mortality among patients with CAP is still high. For this reason, interest has been focused on nonantibiotic therapeutic measures directed to the host response rather than the microorganism. The development of an efficacious adjunctive treatment has important implications for reducing mortality in CAP. Some clinical studies performed in the last decade have shown a clinically beneficial effect of corticosteroids, possibly by diminishing local and systemic inflammatory host response. Recent meta-analyses showed faster resolution of symptoms, shorter time to clinically stability, reduction of mechanical ventilation needed, and reduction of mortality in the most severe population, although some methodological limitations must be taken into account. In addition, some studies using statins also suggested improved outcomes due to its anti-inflammatory effect in CAP, although this requires further research. Other adjunctive therapies such as immunoglobulins and stem cells are being explored, but are not yet in the stage of clinical trials. In summary, the use of corticosteroids and other adjuvant treatments are promising in CAP, but more studies are needed to determine their impact on mortality.

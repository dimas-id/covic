The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly reached pandemic levels. Sufficient testing for SARS-CoV-2 remains essential for tracking and containing the rapid spread of the virus. However, due to increased global demand, kits and proprietary reagents for RNA extraction are limited, which markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 testing capabilities in many countries. Here, we explore the use of conventional acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (AGPC)-based RNA purification as an alternative to commercial automated systems for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. 87 clinical oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens were extracted by AGPC and compared to the commercial platforms, the Maxwell(R) RSC 48 instrument for automated RNA extraction and the fully integrated diagnostic system, the Cobas(R)6800 apparatus. Our results show that RNA extracted using the AGPC method is fully comparable to modern automated systems regarding analytical sensitivity, specificity and accuracy with respect to detection of SARS-CoV-2 as evaluated by RT-qPCR. Moreover, we find that the AGPC method is easily scalable and implemented in conventional laboratories. Taken together, these data identify conventional AGPC-based RNA extraction as a low cost and suitable alternative to automated systems for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, when automated systems, kits and reagents are not readily available.

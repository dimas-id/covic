Obesity is an increasing problem worldwide. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is gaining popularity. Although it has unique complications such as leakage, bleeding, and stenosis, it is a reliable procedure. A total of 1200 consecutive patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and omentopexy between March 2013 and December 2018 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Body mass index, age, sex, and postoperative complications were recorded in all patients. Of 1200 patients, 864 (72%) were female and 336 (28%) were male. The median age was 38 years (13 to 69 y). Preoperative median body mass index was found as 40.87 kg/m (30 to 88 kg/m). Operative complications included strictures which occurred in 16 (1.33%) patients, bleeding in 7 (0.58%), stapler line leaks in 3 (0.25%), wound infection in 1 (0.08%), fat necrosis in 1 (0.08%), splenic arterial injury in 1 (0.08%), and intra-abdominal abscess in 1 (0.08%) patient. There was no mortality. Sleeve gastrectomy and omentopexy is a safe procedure with low complication rates.

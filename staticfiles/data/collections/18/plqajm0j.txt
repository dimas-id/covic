OBJECTIVE To summarize and analyze the clinical manifestation of the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2004, and therefore providing clues of differential diagnosis for physicians to diagnose SARS cases in a timely manner and find out its transmission. METHODS The clinical data of an out-hospital-imported SARS case and its clinical features were analyzed. RESULTS (1) The delay in diagnosis of this SARS case was largely associated with unclear epidemiologic history; (2) The SARS patient showed characteristics of typical pneumonia in the early stage. The numbers of peripheral white blood cells and lymphocytes were in the normal range without any specific changes typical of SARS. CONCLUSION It is very important for physicians to be alert to the epidemiological data for an early diagnosis of SARS, and therefore early isolation and initiation of appropriate treatment.

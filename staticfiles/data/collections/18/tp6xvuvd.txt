BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), first intended as the first step of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS), is gaining popularity as a per-se procedure because of its effectiveness on weight loss and comorbidity resolution. The extraction of the gastrectomy specimen could be challenging and time-consuming. Different techniques have been described for specimen withdrawal. In this article we report the technique adopted in more than 250 LSGs performed in our department. METHODS In the first 90 LSGs performed in our department from October 2002, the specimen was extracted in a retrieval bag using an endoloop. In the following 160 cases the technique has been simplified: the grasped specimen is withdrawn through the 15-mm trocar site without any additional device. RESULTS We registered only two cases of wound infection (1.2%) with the simplified technique, both occurring in the initial cases. There were no cases of trocar site hernia formation. CONCLUSION The technique described does not require any special devices and seems to be simpler, saves time, and is cost effective if compared with other techniques previously reported.

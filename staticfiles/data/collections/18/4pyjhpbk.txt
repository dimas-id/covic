Kawasaki disease (KD) is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed world and is increasingly being reported from developing countries. KD has a predilection for the coronary arteries. Etiology of this disorder is remains an enigma. Diagnosis of KD is essentially clinical with the help of set of clinical criteria. Incomplete KD is said to occur when these criteria are not fulfilled. However, incomplete KD should not be considered as a milder form of the disease. 2D-echocardiography remains the imaging modality of choice for evaluation and monitoring of cardiac complications but often needs to be supplemented by CT coronary angiography. Intravenous immunoglobulin along with aspirin is the gold standard therapy of treatment for KD. However, there is no consensus on treatment of resistant forms of KD. Patients with KD should be on long-term follow-up especially if they have developed coronary artery abnormalities during the acute stage.

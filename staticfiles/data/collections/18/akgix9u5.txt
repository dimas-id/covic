Detection of neuro-muscular fatigue in strength training is difficult, due to missing criterion measures and the complexity of fatigue. Thus, a variety of methods are used to determine fatigue. The aim of this study was to use a principal component analysis (PCA) on a multifactorial data-set based on kinematic measurements to determine fatigue. Twenty participants (strength training experienced, 60% male) executed 3 sets of 3 exercises with 50 (12 repetitions), 75 (12 repetitions) and 100%-12 RM (RM). Data were collected with a 3D accelerometer and analysed by a newly developed algorithm to evaluate parameters for each repetition. A PCA with six variables was carried out on the results. A fatigue factor was computed based on the loadings on the first component. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis was calculated to test for differences between the intensity levels. All six input variables had high loadings on the first component. The ANOVA showed a significant difference between intensities (p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed a difference between 100% and the lower intensities (p < 0.05) and no difference between 50 and 75%-12RM. Based on these results, it is possible to distinguish between fatigued and non-fatigued sets of strength training.

Various treatment methods for tracheal defects have been attempted, such as artificial implants, allografts, autogenous grafts, and tissue engineering; however, no perfect method has been established. We attempted to create an effective artificial trachea via a tissue engineering method using 3D bio-printing. A multi-layered scaffold was fabricated using a 3D printer. Polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydrogel were used with nasal epithelial and auricular cartilage cells in the printing process. An artificial trachea was transplanted into 15 rabbits and a PCL scaffold without the addition of cells was transplanted into 6 rabbits (controls). All animals were followed up with radiography, CT, and endoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months. In the control group, 3 out of 6 rabbits died from respiratory symptoms. Surviving rabbits in control group had narrowed tracheas due to the formation of granulation tissue and absence of epithelium regeneration. In the experimental group, 13 of 15 animals survived, and the histologic examination confirmed the regeneration of epithelial cells. Neonatal cartilage was also confirmed at 6 and 12 months. Our artificial trachea was effective in the regeneration of respiratory epithelium, but not in cartilage regeneration. Additional studies are needed to promote cartilage regeneration and improve implant stability.

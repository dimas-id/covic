In the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the mechanical ventilation is essential. Given its limited availability due to high cost, increased by a global demand, sharing a single mechanical ventilator with 2 or more patients with has been advocated. We have designed an experimental model for ventilating 2 test lungs with a single equipment, in order to measure these possible asymmetries during ventilation in parallel circuits with different compliances. This report attempts a first approach to the risks in ventilating 2 patients with single equipment, since there are differences in volumes which are not monitored by the ventilator, with the consequent risks of distension or alveolar collapse if used in real patients with different thoracopulmonary mechanics.

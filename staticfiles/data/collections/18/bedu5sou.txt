We previously identified a third porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) S variant with a large deletion of 582 nucleotides in the 5' terminal region of the S gene, in addition to the North American type and the S INDELs type. To investigate the pathogenicity of this variant, TTR-2/JPN/2014, we performed experimental infection using colostrum-deprived piglets and compared the results with those from the North American type PEDV, OKN-1/JPN/2013. Fifteen newborn piglets were divided into two groups of 7-8 piglets each and inoculated orally with one of PEDV isolates maintained at the eighth passage in Vero cell culture. Although all PEDV-inoculated piglets showed acute watery diarrhoea, lethality clearly differed between both PEDV-inoculated groups. Moreover, there were differences in virus distribution and lesions on the intestines between the two PEDV-inoculated groups. Therefore, our data suggest that the OKN-1/JPN/2013 PEDV isolate is virulent, whereas the TTR-2/JPN/2014 PEDV isolate is avirulent.

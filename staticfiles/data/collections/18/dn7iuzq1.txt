The newly emerged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is an infectious disease that has spread rapidly throughout the world. The most common signs and symptoms are fever, dry cough and shortness of breath which can progress to severe viral pneumonia and multi‐organ failure in susceptive patients (Chen et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020). Droplet transmission and person‐person transmission appear to be the main route of transmission of COVID‐19, however asymptomatic patients are also carriers of the virus (Rothe et al. 2020).

The umbilicoplasty is a key component of abdominoplasty and closure of autologous abdominal wall donor sites in breast reconstruction (TRAM/DIEP). The aesthetically-pleasing umbilicus tends to be small and vertically-oriented in nature, with superior hooding and shadow, inferior retraction and slope, and positioning at the topmost level of the iliac crest. In this Featured Operative Technique, the authors describe their technique for performing an inverted-V chevron umbilicoplasty, which is their method of choice for restoring the umbilicus to an aesthetic and youthful appearance with minimal scarring.

Electron microscopy (EM) should be used in the front line for detection of agents in emergencies and bioterrorism, on accounts of its speed and accuracy. However, the number of EM diagnostic laboratories has decreased considerably and an increasing number of people encounter difficulties with EM results. Therefore, the research on viral structure and morphologyant in EM diagnostic practice. EM has several technological advantages, and should be a fundamental tool in clinical diagnosis of viruses, particularly when agents are unknown or unsuspected. In this article, we review the historical contribution of EM to virology, and its use in virus differentiation, localization of specific virus antigens, virus-cell interaction, and viral morphogenesis. It is essential that EM investigations are based on clinical and comprehensive pathogenesis data from light or confocal microscopy. Furthermore, avoidance of artifacts or false results is necessary to exploit fully the advantages while minimizing its limitations.

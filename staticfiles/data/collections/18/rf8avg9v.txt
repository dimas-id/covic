A 28-day feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of Yu-Ping-Feng polysaccharides (YPS) containing Astragalus polysaccharides (APS), Atractylodes macrocephala polysaccharides (AMP) and Saposhnikoviae polysaccharides (SPS) on the immune response, intestinal microbiota, disease resistance and growth performance of Litopenaeus vannamei. Seven hundred and twenty shrimp (3.04 Â± 0.33 g) were fed the following diets: Control, YPS1 (0.13% APS + 0.0325% AMP + 0.0325% SPS), YPS2 (0.13% APS + 0.0325% AMP + 0.065% SPS) and YPS3 (0.13% APS + 0.0325% AMP+0.0975% SPS). After 14 and 28 days of feeding, the immune responses of hemocytes and intestine were measured. Intestinal microbiota and growth performance were measured after 28 days of feeding, after that, a 7-day challenge test against Vibrio harveyi was conducted. A significant (P < 0.05) increase of the total haemocyte count (THC), phagocytic activity, antibacterial activity and phenoloxidase (PO) activity was observed in shrimp fed YPS diets compared to the control. Also, dietary YPS supplementation particularly YPS3 group significantly increased the expressions of immune-related genes in the hemocytes and intestine. Regarding the intestinal microbiota, the microbial diversity and richness decreased and functional genes associated with short-chain fatty acids metabolism increased in YPS groups. After Vibrio harveyi challenge, the cumulative mortality in YPS groups was significantly lower than that of the control. Besides, dietary YPS had no significant effect on growth performance of shrimp (P > 0.05). The present results suggested that YPS could be considered as potential prebiotics for aquaculture farmed shrimp.

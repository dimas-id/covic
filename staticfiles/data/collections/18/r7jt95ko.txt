Abstract Infectious HIV-1 requires gp160 cleavage by furin at the REKR511â†“ motif (site1) into the gp120/gp41 complex, whereas the KAKR503 (site2) sequence remains uncleaved. We synthesized 41mer and 51mer peptides, comprising site1 and site2, to study their conformation and in vitro furin processing. We found that, while the previously reported 19mer and 13mer analogues represent excellent in vitro furin substrates, the present extended sequences require heparin for optimal processing. Our data support the hypothesis of a direct binding of heparin with site1 and site2, allowing selective exposure/accessibility of the REKR sequence, which is only then optimally cleaved by furin.

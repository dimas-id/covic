Abstract A series of 1â€²-substituted analogs of 4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine C-nucleoside were prepared and evaluated for the potential as antiviral agents. These compounds showed a broad range of inhibitory activity against various RNA viruses. In particular, the whole cell potency against HCV when R=CN was attributed to inhibition of HCV NS5B polymerase and intracellular concentration of the corresponding nucleoside triphosphate.

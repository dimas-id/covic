OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between corticosteroid therapy and kinetic changes in chest X-ray in five patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS With the identical underlying therapy (levofloxacin or ceftriaxone and macrolide), intravenous methylprednisolone was given at 80 mg twice a day in five patients, and its effect on the development of chest radiogram was observed. RESULTS Chest X-rays radiogram showed significant changes until peak stage (4-12 days) with the same doses of methylprednisolone, but it was dissolved consistently afterwards. CONCLUSION It is appeared that corticosteroid therapy has no marked effect on the development of chest radiogram in patients with SARS. It might indicate there is self-limited in course of SARS.

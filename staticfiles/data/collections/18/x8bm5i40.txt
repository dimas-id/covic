International travel by children is becoming increasingly common over the last few decades. As a result, clinicians may be asked to assist in the evaluation and treatment of an ill child after international travel. Along with recording the typical thorough history of present illness and medical history, the physician who cares for a child in this situation will have to take a thorough travel history and consider not only local conditions, but also possible pathogens that the child may have encountered during the journey. A detailed travel history should be routinely performed to investigate specific exposures. Reference materials are available that can guide the clinician in determining which infectious agents are endemic to various areas of the world. With the exception of obtaining a basic laboratory screen, further evaluation of the young patient should be dictated by the most likely cause of the illness. Repeated testing and examinations and close follow-up may be necessary to arrive at the proper diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

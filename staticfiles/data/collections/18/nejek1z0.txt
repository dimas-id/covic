Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is classified into three subtypes (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c) and is the main cause of enteritis and myocarditis in young domestic and wild animals. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of CPV-2 in the feces of asymptomatic free-living coatis from Garden Forest Reserve, Palmital city, SP, Brazil. Fecal samples from 21 coatis (both sexes, different ages, and different aspects of feces) were collected in August 2014 and March 2015. The nucleic acid extracted was submitted to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to amplify a fragment of the VP2 gene of CPV-2. Eight (38%) fecal samples were positive in the PCR assay and were confirmed by sequencing. The 7 nucleotide (nt) sequences analyzed showed 100% nt identity with the prototype strain of CPV-2b (CPV-39 strain). The analysis of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence revealed the presence of the GAT codon (aa D-Asp) at position 426 of the VP2 viral protein (subtype 2b). This study describes for the first time the identification of CPV-2b in asymptomatic free-living coatis (Nasua nasua) and suggests that coatis are susceptible to Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 infection and are important as a reservoir and an asymptomatic carrier to other wild and domestic animal species.

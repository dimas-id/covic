BACKGROUND Pegfilgrastim, a long-acting granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF), has been used as prophylaxis for severe hematotoxicity induced by chemotherapy. We report a case of aortitis induced by pegfilgrastim administration during modified FOLFIRINOX(mFOLFIRINOX)chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman underwent a distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic tail cancer. Liver metastases appeared 2 years after the surgery. mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy was started with prophylactic administration of pegfilgrastim. Eight days after the first administration and 6 days after administration of the 8th course, the patient developed a fever. The blood test results indicated severe inflammation. Computed tomography revealed a thickened aorta indicating aortitis. The symptoms rapidly improved with antibiotic therapy. We diagnosed aortitis induced by pegfilgrastim administration. CONCLUSION Aortitis should be considered when a patient has unidentified inflammatory findings after receiving pegfilgrastim.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, in part due to the highly infectious nature of the disease. Because SARS-CoV-2 is new, much is unknown regarding mechanisms of transmission, and such information is urgently needed. Here, based on previous findings from related human betacoronaviruses, it is suggested that one possible route of transmission may be via infectious sweat. It is suggested that research be conducted in order to determine whether sweat in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals harbors virus in quantities that can infect others. Findings could be used for formulations of mitigation strategies and empirically based public health messaging.

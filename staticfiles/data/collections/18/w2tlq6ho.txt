Mutation, reassortment, and recombination are the major sources of genetic variation of plant viruses (García-Arenal et al., 2001; Worobey & Holmes, 1999). During mixed infections, viruses can exchange genetic material through recombination or reassortment of segments (when the parental genomes are fragmented) if present in the same cell context of the host plant. Hybrid progeny viruses might then arise, some of them with novel pathogenic characteristics and well adapted in the population that can cause new emerging diseases. Genetic exchange provides organisms with a tool to combine sequences from different origins which might help them to quickly evolve (Crameri et al., 1998). In many DNA and RNA viruses, genetic exchange is achieved through recombination (Froissart et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2005). As increasing numbers of viral sequences become available, recombinant viruses are recognized to be frequent in nature and clear evidence is found for recombination to play a key role in virus evolution (Awadalla, 2003; Chenault & Melcher, 1994; Moonan et al., 2000; Padidam et al., 1999; Revers et al., 1996; García-Arenal et al., 2001; Moreno et al., 2004). Understanding the role of recombination in generating and eliminating variation in viral sequences is thus essential to understand virus evolution and adaptation to changing environments Knowledge about the existence and frequency of recombination in a virus population might help understanding the extent at which genes are exchanged and new virus variants arise. This information is essential, for example, to predict durability of genetic resistance because new recombinant variants might be formed with increased fitness in host-resistant genotypes. Determination of the extent and rate at which genetic rearrangement through recombination does occur in natural populations is also crucial if we use genome and genetic-mapping information to locate genes responsible of important phenotypes such as genes associated with virulence, transmission, or breakdown of resistance. Therefore, better estimates of the rate of recombination will facilitate the development of more robust strategies for virus control (Awadalla, 2003).

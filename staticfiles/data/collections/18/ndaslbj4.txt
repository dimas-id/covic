OBJECTIVES On, March 1, 2020, the Kurdistan Region Government (KRG) announced four confirmed cases of COVID-19. We aimed to explore response of the public towards the prevention principles against coronavirus infection. METHODS The investigators invited individuals from different geographic areas of Duhok governorate of Iraqi Kurdistan in March 2020. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 25.74 (16-95 years). The mean score and prevalence of fear towards coronavirus infection was 4.40 of 10 and 81.9%, respectively. A small percentage of participants did not minimize their exposures by reducing close contact with respiratory droplets (14.5%) and visited public areas during the epidemic (28.7%). The study revealed that 30.8% of the participants did not use facemask or tissues when they sneeze in public areas. Most of the participants washed their hands when there is a possible transfer of coronavirus pathogen (94.6%) and cleaned or disinfected the suspected areas to pathogens at home (84.6%). Some participants did not visit a medical clinic if they get the suspected symptoms of coronavirus infection (11.2%) due to lower education. Participants agreed with the health policies of KRG against coronavirus outbreak (90.8%). CONCLUSIONS Some of the public do not adhere to preventive measures against coronavirus infection.

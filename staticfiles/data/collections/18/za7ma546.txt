BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery has become increasingly utilized for colorectal surgery, with the most frequently reported single-incision laparoscopic operation being right hemicolectomy. While current data suggest that single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy is feasible, safe, and roughly equivalent to standard laparoscopic right colectomy, the technique has to date only been described in highly selected patients. Single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy has not yet been assessed in a standard patient population. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted to evaluate all single-incision right hemicolectomies performed by a single surgeon between May 2010 and April 2011. Demographic data, operative parameters, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy was performed in a series of 30 consecutive patients with indications for right colectomy. One patient required conversion to an open procedure for extensive adhesions, while no patients required additional port placement. Mean operative time was 107 min. All patients had negative margins and had an average of 20 lymph nodes harvested. Mean length of stay was 6 days. There were no intraoperative complications and no mortality in the study. The perioperative complication rate was 37%, with 71% of complications being grade 1. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is feasible, safe, efficient, and oncologically sound for most patients who are seen in a typical colorectal practice. These data are useful as single-incision laparoscopic colectomy becomes more broadly implemented.

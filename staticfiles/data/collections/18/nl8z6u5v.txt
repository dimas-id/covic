Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness caused by the novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has lead to high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, has been causing major public health concerns since first detected in late 2019. Following identification of novel pathogens, questions in relation to dissemination of the pathogen and transmission routes begin to emerge. This rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in both faecal and wastewater samples across the globe, highlighting the potential for faecal-oral transmission of the virus. As a result, concerns regarding the transmission of the virus in the environment and the risk associated with contracting the virus in recreational waters, particularly where inadequately treated wastewater is discharged, have been emerging in recent weeks. This paper highlights the need for further research to be carried out to investigate the presence, infectivity and viability of this newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater effluent and receiving recreational waters.

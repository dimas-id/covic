Objective To determine the frequency of detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) among infants evaluated for late-onset sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods This study was a prospective cohort study. Results During the 13-month study, 84 infants underwent 116 sepsis evaluations, and CMV DNA was detected in saliva in three (4%) infants (median: gestational age 28 weeks, birth weight 950 g), representing 5% (n=6) of all sepsis evaluations. One infant had CMV DNA detected in saliva in all four sepsis evaluations. Two infants had acquired CMV infection, while the timing of CMV acquisition could not be determined in one infant. Two of the three infants had concomitant Gram-negative bacteremia and urinary tract infections (UTIs), two developed severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and none died. Conclusion Detection of CMV DNA in saliva occurred in 4% of infants and 5% of sepsis evaluations. Persistence of CMV DNA shedding in saliva made attribution of clinical illness difficult to ascertain.

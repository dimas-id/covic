At present, the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is rampant all over the country, and controlling the spread of its epidemic has become a top priority. It is very difficult to control the epidemic spreading because there is no specific drug to fight against it. Therefore, it is urgent task for us to develop a specific drug as soon as possible, and attracting worldwide attention. The studies on anti-2019-nCoV drugs were generally carried out in three modes, as vaccine, chemical drugs and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Because the developing on vaccines and chemicals takes too long, it is hard to solve the urgent problem. Moreover, the RNA of coronavirus has been recombined so quickly that the vaccines and drugs studied with great efforts not only may miss the epidemic time, but also cannot be used in the next generation of new coronavirus treatment, as a result that the work of epidemic prevention is formidable. However, the prescriptions from traditional Chinese medicine theory can cure the epidemic disease, but how to develop it into a specific drug with clear chemical composition and clear pharmacologic mechanism, is also an urgent problem to be solved. In this paper, the new coronavirus and its drug development are reviewed, while the advantages and disadvantages are analyzed, and the drug dilemma research phenomenon is clarified by using the supramolecular “qi chromatography” theory. It is suggested that the strategy of anti-coronavirus drug developing should be put forward based on the impact of “qi chromatography” of biological supramolecular “imprinting template”, in order to develop new drugs against 2019-nCoV to control the spread of the epidemic as quick as we can, and establish a new research and development model of anti-coronavirus drug on integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, turning passive into active.

A simulation tool that supports developers to build scenarios automatically in multiple simulation platforms is proposed. As an essential part of this simulator, this study proposed an activity schedule generator to mimic the daily life of elderly people living alone. This generator outperforms existing methods of activity schedule planning in three aspects: 1) it is adaptive to the layout of a simulated smart house; 2) there is no unspecified time in the timeline of generated schedules; and 3) it generates stable, but not tedious schedules for a number of days. A real-time location data generator is proposed to convert generated schedules to simulated real-time location data of the resident, and a proposed interface converts these simulated location data to simulated records of virtual passive infrared (PIR) sensors, which can be used to optimize placement of PIR sensors in a smart house.

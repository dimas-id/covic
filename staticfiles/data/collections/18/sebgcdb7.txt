Since the beginning of the COVID‐19 pandemic, different types of cutaneous manifestations have been reported. In Spain, there were reports in the first weeks of April 2020 of an increase in purpuric acral lesions similar to perniosis on the hands and especially the feet of children and young adults. These patients do not normally present with clinical manifestations linked to COVID‐19, and their PCR and serological tests are usually negative for specific IgM and IgG.

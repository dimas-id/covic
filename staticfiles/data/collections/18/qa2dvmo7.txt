BACKGROUND: Exposure to asbestos causes non-malignant and malignant diseases including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The modern history of such diseases goes back more than a century. MAIN TEXT: While much is known about the ability of asbestos to cause disease, the carcinogenic mechanism is not yet understood. Continuing legitimate scientific questions include such issues as potential differential toxicity and carcinogenicity of different fiber types. Illegitimate issues include the supposed “safe” use of asbestos, and the chrysotile hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Asbestos disease issues are highly politicized and vested economic interests perpetuate false issues regarding the hazards of asbestos.

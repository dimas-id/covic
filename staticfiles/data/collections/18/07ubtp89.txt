Branch-and-bound (BnB) and memetic algorithms represent two very different approaches for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, these approaches are compatible. In this correspondence, a hybrid model that combines these two techniques is considered. To be precise, it is based on the interleaved execution of both approaches. Since the requirements of time and memory in BnB techniques are generally conflicting, a truncated exact search, namely, beam search, has opted to be carried out. Therefore, the resulting hybrid algorithm has a heuristic nature. The multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem and the shortest common supersequence problem have been chosen as benchmarks. As will be shown, the hybrid algorithm can produce better results in both problems at the same computational cost, especially for large problem instances.

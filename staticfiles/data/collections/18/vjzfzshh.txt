Viral mutation rates vary widely in nature, yet the mechanistic and evolutionary determinants of this variability remain unclear. Small DNA viruses mutate orders of magnitude faster than their hosts despite using host-encoded polymerases for replication, which suggests these viruses may avoid post-replicative repair. Supporting this, the genome of bacteriophage Ï•X174 is completely devoid of GATC sequence motifs, which are required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. Here, we show that restoration of the randomly expected number of GATC sites leads to an eightfold reduction in the rate of spontaneous mutation of the phage, without severely impairing its replicative capacity over the short term. However, the efficacy of mismatch repair in the presence of GATC sites is limited by inefficient methylation of the viral DNA. Therefore, both GATC avoidance and DNA under-methylation elevate the mutation rate of the phage relative to that of the host. We also found that the effects of GATC sites on the phage mutation rate vary extensively depending on their specific location within the phage genome. Finally, the mutation rate reduction afforded by GATC sites is fully reverted under stress conditions, which up-regulate repair pathways and expression of error-prone host polymerases such as heat and treatment with the base analog 5-fluorouracil, suggesting that access to repair renders the phage sensitive to stress-induced mutagenesis.

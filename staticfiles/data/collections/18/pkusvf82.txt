Objective: to undertake a review and critical appraisal of all published/preprint reports that offer an estimation of incubation periods for novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Design: a rapid and systematic review/critical appraisal Data sources: COVID-19 Open Research Dataset supplied by Georgetown's Centre for Security and Emerging Technology as well as PubMed and Embase via Arxiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Results: screening was undertaken 44,000 articles with a final selection of 25 studies referring to 18 different experimental projects related to the estimation of the incubation period of COVID-19. Findings: The majority of extant published estimates offer empirical evidence showing that the incubation period for the virus is a mean of 7.8 days, with a median of 5.01 days, which falls into the ranges proposed by the WHO (0 to 14 days) and the ECDC (2 to 12 days). Nevertheless, a number of authors proposed that quarantine time should be a minimum of 14 days and that for estimates of mortality risks a median time delay of 13 days between illness and mortality should be under consideration. It is unclear as to whether any correlation exists between the age of patients and the length of time they incubate the virus. Finally, it is generally agreed that robust precautions must be put in place for the prevention and/or mitigation of asymptomatic transmission to high-risk patients caused by those incubating the virus.

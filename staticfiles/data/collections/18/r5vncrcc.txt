Replication of murine coronaviruses in eight mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines of several genetic backgrounds was examined. Both mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) type 2 and MHV, strain A59 replicated well with no or minimal cytopathic effect in all the ES cell lines tested. The results suggest the possibility that MHV-infected ES cells may disseminate MHV in mouse colonies due to embryo manipulation.

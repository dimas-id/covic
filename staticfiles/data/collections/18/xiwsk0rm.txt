Abstract This chapter discusses ways to identify, categorize, and assess risks in supply chains. It pays particular attention to the often hidden risks that can lurk deep within global supply chains. Using case studies, the chapter shows how companies assess and prioritize supplier risks, and it explains the underlying factors that give rise to deep-chain risks. The sweep of examples in the chapter shows that companies can model the likelihood and impacts of a wide range of risks to their facilities, suppliers, and logistics infrastructure.

Two sorts of circular traffic systems are defined and their minimal length of recurrent transition sequences is computed. The result is used for finding cycloids that have an isomorphic reachability graph. Cycloids are particular Petri nets for modelling processes of actions or events, belonging to the fundaments of Petri’s general systems theory. They have very different interpretations, ranging from Einstein’s relativity theory to elementary information processing gates. The cycloid representation of circular traffic systems allows to identify basic synchronisation mechanisms and leads to a structure theory of such systems.

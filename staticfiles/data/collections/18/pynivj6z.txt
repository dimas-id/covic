PurposeAnterior approach white line advancement presents a novel surgical option for correction of blepharoptosis. The technique draws on several advantages of other approaches. The aim of this study was to present outcomes using this technique at a minimum follow-up of 18 months.Patients and methodsParticipants having undergone anterior approach white line advancement ptosis correction at a single institution were retrospectively recruited at a minimum of 18 months' follow-up. A total of 18 independent eyelid measurements were recorded at final review. Outcomes included long-term rate of surgical success, upper eyelid margin-reflex distance (MRD1) at both early and late post-operative follow-up, inter-eyelid asymmetry, complications, re-operation rate, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life improvement using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Pre- and post-operative MRD1, as well as inter-eyelid asymmetry, were compared using a two-tailed t-test.ResultsIn total, 82 eyelids of 47 participants were included with a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (range 1.5-3.7). Surgical success was achieved in 91.5%, with a final mean MRD1 of 3.5 mm (95% confidence 3.2-3.7). An increase of 2.4 mm (2.1-2.8) in eyelid height was observed between baseline and long-term follow-up (P<0.0001). No significant change was observed between early and late post-operative follow-up. Pre-operative asymmetry was reduced from 1.0 mm (0.7-1.3) to 0.4 mm (0.3-0.5; P<0.0001). Patient satisfaction was 95.7% with a mean GBI score of +21.8 (13.2-30.3).ConclusionsAnterior approach white line advancement presents an excellent option for patients undergoing ptosis correction with favourable long-term results. Comparisons are made with other techniques with respect to anatomical, functional, and surgical factors.

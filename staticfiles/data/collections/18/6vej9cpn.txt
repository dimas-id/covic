Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor which can be activated by cytokines, growth factor receptors, and nonreceptor-like tyrosine kinase. An activated STAT3 translocates into the nucleus and combines with DNA to regulate the expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that STAT3 plays important roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. STAT3 exhibits a proviral function in several viral infections, including those of HBV, HCV, HSV-1, varicella zoster virus, human CMV and measles virus. However, in some circumstances, STAT3 has an antiviral function in other viral infections, such as enterovirus 71, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. This review summarizes the roles of STAT3 in viral infection and pathogenesis, and briefly discusses the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We explored changes in the patient population and practice of endovascular therapy during the course of the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III Trial. METHODS Changes in baseline characteristics, use of baseline CT angiography, treatment times and specifics, and outcomes were compared between the first 4 protocols and the fifth and final protocol. RESULTS Compared with subjects treated in the first 4 protocol versions (n=610), subjects treated in fifth and final protocol (n=46) were older (75 versus 68 years, P<0.0002) and less likely to have a pretreatment Rankin of 0 (76% versus 89%, P=0.01), were more likely to have a pretreatment CT angiography (65% versus 45%, P=0.009), had quicker median times in the endovascular arm from onset to start of intra-arterial therapy (209 versus 250 minutes, P=0.002) and to reperfusion (269 versus 344 minutes, P<0.0001), had a higher mean dose of total tissue-type plasminogen activator in the endovascular arm (74.0 versus 63.7 mg, P<0.0001), and were less likely to receive intra-arterial tissue-type plasminogen activator as part of the endovascular procedure (16% versus 44%, P=0.015). There were no significant differences in functional and safety outcomes between subjects treated in the 2 treatments arms in either the first 4 protocols or fifth protocol although the small sample size in the fifth protocol provided limited power. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular technology and diagnostic approaches to acute stroke patients changed substantially during the IMS III Trial. Efforts to decrease the time to delivery of endovascular therapy were successful.

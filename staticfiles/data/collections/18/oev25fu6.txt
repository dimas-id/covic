Background and Aims: Simulation is one of the important learning tools when it comes to skill acquisition and as a supplemental tool for training in high stake situations like COVID-19. The aim of this study is to meet the global requirements of knowledge on ventilatory management, prepare and to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching module for non-anesthesiology trainees on COVID-19 patients. Methods: Quasi experimental cross sectional pilot study was conducted with a sample of twenty-six trainees. A teaching module was prepared and validated which consisted of lectures, audio-video sessions, demonstrations with hands-on training, debriefing, analytical-phase and reflection. Pre and Post evaluations from student t-test and direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) were used for knowledge and skill assessment respectively and feedback obtained from Likert's score. Results: Pre- and Post-tests had a mean score of 7.42 ± 2.12 and 14.92 ± 2.9 respectively (P value 0.00001). DOPS included 16 point score, in which 23 trainees (88.4%) met the expectations and above expectations as per training objectives. A five-point Likert's score feedback revealed satisfactory and highly satisfactory scores of 100% (ABG), 96.1% (mechanical ventilation), and 84.6% (ventilation in COVID-19 patients). Overall satisfaction for the workshop among respondents was 100 per cent. Confidences of handling scores were 84.5% (interpreting ABG), 65.3% (maneuvering mechanical ventilation), and 96.15% (intubation in COVID-19 patients). Conclusion: A planned teaching module in ventilation management helps to train non-anaesthesiologists more effectively as a part of COVID-19 preparedness. Simulation with debriefing based training to the medical fraternity is the best alternative in the present pandemic and it will also ensure the safety of health care professionals.

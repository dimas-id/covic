Ion transport in the jejunal mucosa of 14- to 16-day-old piglets with severe diarrhea 40hr after infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus was studied. In infected pigs Na(+) transport failed to. respond normally to glucose when studied either in Ussing short-circuited chambers or in suspensions of enterocytes isolated selectively from jejunal villi. Theophylline, 10 mm, added to the chambers produced the same brisk electrical responses and increments in net Cl(âˆ’) secretion in tissue from both infected and control groups. A defect in glucose-stimulated Na(+) absorption in the acute stage of a viral enteritis has been identified which probably contributes to the impaired lumen-to-extracellular fluid flux of Na(+) found previously in the jejunum of intact TGE-infected pigs. The mechanisms causing diarrhea in this invasive viral enteritis differ from those causing toxigenic diarrhea.

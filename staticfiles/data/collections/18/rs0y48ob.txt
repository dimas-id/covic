In late 2019, cases of atypical pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were first reported in Wuhan, China. The disease was officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared a pandemic disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). The clinical symptoms may include fever, cough, fatigue, headache, and diarrhea. The radiographic features comprise various presentations, including ground-glass opacities, tiny nodules, and consolidation. However, some atypical pathogens related to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may share similar presentations. They may be difficult to distinguish according to the clinical presentation and radiographic findings. Recently, there have been several reports reminding physicians to heed the possibility of co-infection with other pathogens in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We report a COVID-19 patient co-infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae who recovered well after combination therapy. We propose that all COVID-19 patients should undergo a meticulous screening routine to ensure that they receive adequate treatments.

Nucleic acid amplification techniques such as PCR have facilitated rapid and accurate diagnosis in central laboratories over the past years. PCR-based amplifications require high-precision instruments to perform thermal cycling reactions. Such equipment is bulky, expensive and complex to operate. Progressive advances in isothermal amplification chemistries, microfluidics and detectors miniaturisation are paving the way for the introduction and use of compact ‘sample in-results out’ diagnostic devices. However, this paradigm shift towards decentralised testing poses diverse technological, economic and organizational challenges both in industrialized and developing countries. This review describes the landscape of molecular isothermal diagnostic techniques for infectious diseases, their characteristics, current state of development, and available products, with a focus on new directions towards point-of-care applications.

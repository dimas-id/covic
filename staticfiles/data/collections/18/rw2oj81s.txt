Oscillometry has been used in adjunct with spirometry in many studies and in clinical practice. Recent events with the spread of a viral respiratory pandemic has caused many clinics to stop using standard spirometry for the fear of aerosol transmission of virus. With recent experiences of our and other groups using oscillometry demonstrating its sensitivity, precision, and ease of use without any forced maneuvers, we suggest that it could be an alternative to spirometry while minimizing exhalation aerosol generation.

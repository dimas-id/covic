In a retrospective study of 39 COVID-19 patients and 32 control participants in China, we collected clinical data and examined the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Serum levels of fractalkine, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) elevated in mild patients, dramatically in severe cases, while decreased in the convalescence phase. In conclusion, the increased expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules is related to COVID-19 and disease severity and may contribute to coagulation dysfunction.

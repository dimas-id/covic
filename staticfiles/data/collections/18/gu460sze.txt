The genus Pneumocystis comprises potential pathogens that reside normally in the lungs of a wide range of mammals. Although they generally behave as transient or permanent commensals, they can occasionally cause life-threatening pneumonia (Pneumocystis pneumonia; PCP) in immunosuppressed individuals. Several decades ago, the presence of Pneumocystis morphotypes (trophic forms and cysts) was described in the lungs of normal cats and cats with experimentally induced symptomatic PCP (after immunosuppression by corticosteroids); yet to date spontaneous or drug-induced PCP has not been described in the clinical feline literature, despite immunosuppression of cats by long-standing retrovirus infections or after kidney transplantation. In this study, we describe the presence of Pneumocystis DNA in the lungs of normal cats (that died of various unrelated causes; n = 84) using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting the mitochondrial small and large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (mtSSU rRNA and mtLSU rRNA). The presence of Pneumocystis DNA was confirmed by sequencing in 24/84 (29%) cats, with evidence of two different sequence types (or lineages). Phylogenetically, lineage1 (L1; 19 cats) and lineage 2 (L2; 5 cats) formed separate clades, clustering with Pneumocystis from domestic pigs (L1) and carnivores (L2), respectively. Results of the present study support the notion that cats can be colonized or subclinically infected by Pneumocystis, without histological evidence of damage to the pulmonary parenchyma referable to pneumocystosis. Pneumocystis seems most likely an innocuous pathogen of catsâ€™ lungs, but its possible role in the exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disorders or viral/bacterial coinfections should be considered further in a clinical setting.

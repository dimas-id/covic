PURPOSE The present study was designed to investigate whether there is a difference in the anastomotic leakage rate (AL) between the single stapling (CSA) and double stapling (DSA) anastomosis techniques. METHODS One hundred consecutive rectal cancer patients who underwent rectal resection with primary anastomosis were enrolled in this study. RESULTS The overall rate of clinical anastomotic leakage in both groups was 7 % (7/100); 6 % (3/50) in the CSA group and 8 % (4/50) in the DSA group. The anastomotic technique did not have any significant influence on the rate of AL. All AL were seen in low anastomoses (7 cm and below). The rate of AL in patients with a diverting stoma (13 %, 3/23) was not significantly different from that of the patients without (5.2 %, 4/77) (p = 0.195). The mean length of the operation was significantly shorter in the DSA group compared to the CSA group, at 127 and 141 min, respectively (p = 0.005). There were significantly higher rates of AL in patients receiving preoperative long course radiotherapy (15.4 %, 6/39) compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy (1.63 %, 1/61) (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS The CSA and DSA techniques are equally safe for the creation of a rectal anastomosis, without any significant difference in the AL rate. However, we recommend using the DSA technique because it has other definite advantages. In cases of neoadjuvant treatment and a low anastomosis, proximal diversion is recommended.

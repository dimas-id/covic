Lung ultrasound examination has been demonstrated to be an accurate imaging method to detect pulmonary and pleural conditions. During pregnancy, there is a need for rapid assessment of the maternal lung in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019. We report our experience on lung ultrasound examination in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in a pregnant woman. Typical ultrasound features of this pulmonary pathology, including diffuse hyperechoic vertical artifacts with thickened pleural line and "white lung" with patchy distribution, were observed. We suggest point-of-care lung ultrasound examination as a diagnostic imaging tool in pregnant women with suspected coronavirus disease 2019.

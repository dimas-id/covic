PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the heat generation of surgical clips within the target area of MWA and the influences on the ablation volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS In bovine liver tissue, 42 ex vivo microwave ablations (60 W; 180 s) were performed. During ablation, the temperature was measured continuously at 4 points of interest (POI), in a distance of 7.5 and 15 mm on each side of the microwave antenna, with a titanium surgical placed at one 7.5-mm POI. Ablation volumes containing large vessels (n = 10) were excluded. For every POI, the mean temperature of 32 ablations was calculated. The mean temperatures were compared between the 4 POI and statistically analyzed using the Student's t test. RESULTS The mean maximum temperatures at the side of the clip were 88.76 °C/ 195 s and 52.97 °C/ 195 s and at the side without clip 78.75 °C/ 195 s and 43.16 °C/ 195 s, respectively, at POI 7.5 mm and POI 15 mm. The maximum difference of mean temperatures for POI 7.5 mm was 12.91 °C at 84 s (p = 0.022) and for POI 15 mm 9.77 °C at 195 s (p = 0.009). No significant changes in size and shape of the ablation zone could be determined. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated significantly higher temperatures adjacent to surgical clips. Also, the temperatures distal to the titanium clip were higher compared to the control location without clip. These findings suggest an increased risk of thermal damage to surrounding tissues during MWA, especially in case of immediate contact to surgical clips.

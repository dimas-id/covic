INTRODUCTION Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) is widely used for the excision of both benign and malignant rectal tumours. It is relatively expensive and can be a challenging technique. A recent development in laparoscopic surgery is the single-port technique (single-incision laparoscopic surgery, SILS). The SILS port is a flexible multichannel port for transumbilical laparoscopic surgery. Even though not developed for transanal use the port could be ideal because of its shape and texture. METHODS 12 patients underwent transanal resection using an SILS port and normal laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS 10 out of 12 patients were treated successfully with the SILS port. Two polyps were resected using an open transanal technique because the distance between the SILS port and the polyp was too small. The average operative time was 55 min (range 40-80 min). All patients could be discharged on the first postoperative day. There were no major complications. CONCLUSION Our current data show that transanal surgery using a single port is a relatively easy procedure with operative times comparable to TEM. More surgeons will therefore be able to perform transanal endoscopic surgery.

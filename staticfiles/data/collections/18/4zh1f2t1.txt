Abstract Insiders—who are within a security parameter of a system—can intentionally or unintentionally harm the system due to their granted access authorization and intimate knowledge of the system. Especially, Cyber-Manufacturing systems employing Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to control manufacturing processes via various computer networks can be easily compromised and critically damaged by insiders. This paper presents a system architecture of an applied blockchain in Cyber-Manufacturing System, where the input data for PLC is stored and retrieved through the blockchain. The paper demonstrates how the blockchain technology can help preventing the data from unintended manipulation or data injection by insiders.

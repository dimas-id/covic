A study is presented on the use of real-time information about symptomatic infectious individuals to adjust restrictions of human contacts at two basic levels, the stricter being on the symptomatic infectious group. Explicit analytical formulas as well as numerical results are presented to rapidly elucidate what-if questions on averting resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic after the first wave wanes. Implementation of related ideas would rely on a mix of several factors, including personal initiative and sophisticated technology for monitoring and testing. For robust decision making on the subject, detailed multidisciplinary studies remain indispensable.

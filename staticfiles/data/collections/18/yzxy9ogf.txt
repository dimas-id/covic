RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene silencing has become one of the most successful strategies in not only identifying gene function but also in improving agronomical traits of crops by silencing genes of different pathogens/pests and also plant genes for improvement of desired trait. The conserved nature of RNAi pathway across different organisms increases its applicability in various basic and applied fields. Here we attempt to summarize the knowledge generated on the fundamental mechanisms of RNAi over the years, with emphasis on insects and plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). This chapter also reviews the rich history of RNAi research, gene regulation by small RNAs across different organisms, and application potential of RNAi for generating transgenic plants resistant to major pests(.) But, there are some limitations too which restrict wider applications of this technology to its full potential. Further refinement of this technology in terms of resolving these shortcomings constitutes one of the thrust areas in present RNAi research. Nevertheless, its application especially in breeding agricultural crops resistant against biotic stresses will certainly offer the possible solutions for some of the breeding objectives which are otherwise unattainable.

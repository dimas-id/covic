Dynamic regulation of gene expression in response to various molecules is crucial for both basic science and practical applications. RNA is considered an attractive material for creating dynamic genetic controllers because of its specific binding to ligands, structural flexibility, programmability, and small size. Here, we review recent advances in strategies for developing RNA-based dynamic controllers and applications. First, we describe studies that re-engineered natural riboswitches to generate new dynamic controllers. Next, we summarize RNA-based regulatory mechanisms that have been exploited to build novel artificial dynamic controllers. We also discuss computational methods and high-throughput selection approaches for de novo design of dynamic RNA controllers. Finally, we explain applications of dynamic RNA controllers for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

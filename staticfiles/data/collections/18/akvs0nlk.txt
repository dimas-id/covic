In this article we consider the three-dimensional numerical simulation of Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems involving large solid deformations. The one-field Fictitious Domain Method (FDM) is introduced in the framework of an operator splitting scheme. Three-dimensional numerical examples are presented in order to validate the proposed approach: demonstrating energy stability and mesh convergence; and extending two dimensional benchmarks from the FSI literature. New three dimensional benchmarks are also proposed.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has demonstrated beneficial effects after myocardial infarction (MI). Microencapsulation of IGF-1 could potentially improve results. We aimed to test the effect of an intracoronary (IC) infusion of microencapsulated IGF-1 in a swine acute MI model. For that purpose IC injection of a 10 ml solution of 5 × 106 IGF-1 loaded microspheres (MSPs) (n = 8, IGF-1 MSPs), 5 × 106 unloaded MSPs (n = 9; MSPs) or saline (n = 7; CON) was performed 48 hours post-MI. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), indexed ventricular volumes and infarct size (IS) were determined by cardiac magnetic resonance at pre-injection and 10 weeks. Animals were euthanized at 10 weeks, and myocardial fibrosis and vascular density were analysed. End-study LVEF was significantly greater in IGF-1 MSPs compared to MSPs and CON, while ventricular volumes exhibited no significant differences between groups. IS decreased over time in all groups. Collagen volume fraction on the infarct area was significantly reduced in IGF-1 MSPs compared to CON and MSPs. Vascular density analysis of infarct and border zones showed no significant differences between groups. In conclusion, the IC injection of 5 × 106 IGF-1 loaded MSPs in a porcine acute MI model successfully improves cardiac function and limits myocardial fibrosis, which could be clinically relevant.

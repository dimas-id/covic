In newly-weaned 3â€“4 week old piglets (n=29) diarrhoea (100%) and vomiting (65%) were induced by inoculation with transmissible gastroenteritis virus and enterotoxigenic E. coli strains (0(149):K(91):K(88ac); LT, STa and STb enterotoxin positive). This combined infection resulted in pronounced mortality within 7 days. During this period the piglets had decreases in body weight, arterial pressure and leucocyte count and increases in heart rate and in total plasma protein concentration. The plasma pH and lactic acid concentration decreased, whereas the values for pO(2), pCO(2) and frequency of respiration did not change significantly. No significant changes in the serum concentrations of potassium, chloride or calcium were observed, whereas sodium concentration revealed a transient increase. In shocked and dying piglets an increase in haematocrit was observed, whereas base excess and bicarbonate concentration decreased. Flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, administered intramuscularly on 3 successive days following the combined infection at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/12 h was without beneficial effect on diarrhoea or mortality.

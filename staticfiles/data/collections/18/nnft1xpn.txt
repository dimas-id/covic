We report here a rare complication in the form of kinking of flow diverter in a case of giant wide-necked supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm 48 hours after the procedure. This 28-year female presented with giant wide-necked right supraclinoid ICA aneurysm which was managed by flow diversion. On 2nd post-op day, patient developed weakness of left side with altered sensorium - angiography and CT showed kinking of flow diverter at the neck of the aneurysm with poor distal flow. Eventually, the patient developed right middle cerebral artery infarct for which decompressive hemicraniectomy was done. The likely cause of development of kink is because the aneurysm was wide-necked, the hemodynamic forces have resulted in inward buckling of the flow diverter at the aneurysm neck. This case shows that kinking of flow diverter can still happen 48 hours post-procedure.

The world is suffering a respiratory pandemic disease caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), commonly known as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as experimental treatments for COVID-19 leading to a shortage of both medications. A literature review conducted in April 2020 shows a lack of high-quality data available, resulting in ambiguous guideline recommendations. Decisions to use either drug should be made with careful consideration of risks versus benefits along with proper monitoring. Because of its higher potency and better safety profile, hydroxychloroquine may be the more reasonable treatment option if treatment is initiated.

Severely afflicted patients with the COVID-19 may become in need of mechanical ventilation. The cause of acute respiratory failure is a massive hyperinflammation in the lungs, and treatment with glucocorticoids is not recommended by the WHO. A rare haematological disease, the virus-associated haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis syndrome (HLS), is associated with high mortality and a similar hyperinflammation syndrome. Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor treatment is highly efficacious in HLS. In this review, we discuss the rationales and perspectives for using JAK1/2 inhibitors in severely afflicted patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

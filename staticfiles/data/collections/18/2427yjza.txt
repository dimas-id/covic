We read with great interest the article “COVID‐19: what if the brain had a role in causing the deaths?” by Tassorelli and co‐workers, in which the authors generate and summarize hypotheses how SARS‐CoV‐2 may enter the peripheral and central nervous system and cause life‐threatening complications [1]. With this letter we would like to contribute to this discussion by highlighting how different complications of COVID‐19 may result in damage to central and peripheral parts of the swallowing network leading to dysphagia in critically ill COVID‐survivors.

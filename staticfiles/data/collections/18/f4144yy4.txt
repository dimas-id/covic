BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and to determine the association of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The electronic database of Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of eligible studies that reported the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was performed. The incidences of AKI were compared between severe versus non-severe patients and survivors versus non-survivors. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies involving 4963 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The proportions of patients with elevation of sCr and BUN levels were 9.6% (95% CI 5.7-13.5%) and 13.7% (95% CI 5.5-21.9%), respectively. Of all patients, 57.2% (95% CI 40.6-73.8%) had proteinuria, 38.8% (95% CI 26.3-51.3%) had proteinuria +, and 10.6% (95% CI 7.9-13.3%) had proteinuria ++ or +++. The overall incidence of AKI in all COVID-19 patients was 4.5% (95% CI 3.0-6.0%), while the incidence of AKI was 1.3% (95% CI 0.2-2.4%), 2.8% (95% CI 1.4-4.2%), and 36.4% (95% CI 14.6-58.3%) in mild or moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases, respectively. Meanwhile, the incidence of AKI was 52.9%(95% CI 34.5-71.4%), 0.7% (95% CI - 0.3-1.8%) in non-survivors and survivors, respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was required in 5.6% (95% CI 2.6-8.6%) severe patients, 0.1% (95% CI - 0.1-0.2%) non-severe patients and 15.6% (95% CI 10.8-20.5%) non-survivors and 0.4% (95% CI - 0.2-1.0%) survivors, respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was high and AKI is closely associated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is important to increase awareness of kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.

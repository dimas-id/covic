During the period of COVID-19, the medical waste disposal capacity is seriously inadequate. The main technical process of the municipal solid waste incineration system is the same as that of the medical waste incineration system. Under the conditions of optimizing the technological process, improving the supporting facilities, and controlling the co-processing ratio, the municipal solid waste incinerator (grate furnace) co-processing medical waste is feasible. Some suggested guidelines for emergency treatment of medical waste from COVID-19 have been provided by China.

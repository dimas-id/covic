Protein composition is restricted by the genetic code to a relatively small number of natural amino acids. Similarly, the known three-dimensional structures adopt a limited number of protein folds. However, proteins exert a large variety of functions and show a remarkable ability for regulation and immediate response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli. To some degree, the wide variability of protein function can be attributed to the post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications have been observed in all kingdoms of life and give to proteins a significant degree of chemical and consequently functional and structural diversity. Their importance is partly reflected in the large number of genes dedicated to their regulation. So far, hundreds of post-translational modifications have been observed while it is believed that many more are to be discovered along with the technological advances in sequencing, proteomics, mass spectrometry and structural biology. Indeed, the number of studies which report novel post translational modifications is getting larger supporting the notion that their space is still largely unexplored. In this review we explore the impact of post-translational modifications on protein structure and function with emphasis on catalytic activity regulation. We present examples of proteins and protein families whose catalytic activity is substantially affected by the presence of post translational modifications and we describe the molecular basis which underlies the regulation of the protein function through these modifications. When available, we also summarize the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms which introduce these modifications to protein sites.

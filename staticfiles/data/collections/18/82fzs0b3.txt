The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is a betacoronavirus closely related to the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The recent COVID-19 outbreak created an urgent need for treatment. To expedite the development of such treatment, pharmaceutical companies and government agencies are currently testing several existing drugs for their effect on the virus. Gene-Eden-VIR and Novirin are natural, broad-spectrum, antiviral treatments proven to be safe and effective in several clinical studies. In this article, we present evidence indicating that the 5 Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin ingredients have anti-betacoronavirus, and specifically, anti-SARS-CoV effects. We consider this evidence as a first indication of the anti-coronavirus effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin. Next, we are planning to conduct a clinical study with users of the treatments to test the effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on individuals at risk and those infected with the virus.

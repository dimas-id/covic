The COVID-19 pandemic has affected most countries of the world. As corona viruses are highly prevalent in the cold season, the question remains whether or not the pandemic will improve with increasing temperatures in the Northern hemisphere. We use data from a primary care registry of almost 15,000 patients over 20 years to retrieve information on viral respiratory infection outbreaks. Our analysis suggests that the severity of the pandemic will be softened by the seasonal change to summer.

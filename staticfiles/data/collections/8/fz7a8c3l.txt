This paper addresses map-based information systems in the public health sector as an important application area in cartography. First, the characteristics of map-based information systems are defined followed by a discussion of the advantages of delivering health data over the Internet compared to traditional printed publications. To illustrate the general overview, three examples of map-based information systems on infectious diseases from Lower Saxony are presented. Finally some conclusions are drawn and it is argued that a big potential for map-based information systems in the health sector can be anticipated.

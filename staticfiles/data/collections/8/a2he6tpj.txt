PURPOSE: To provide recommendations and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital preparations for an influenza pandemic or mass disaster with a specific focus on protection of patients and staff. METHODS: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including protection of patients and staff. RESULTS: Key recommendations include: (1) prepare infection control and occupational health policies for clinical risks relating to potential disease transmission; (2) decrease clinical risks and provide adequate facilities through advanced planning to maximise capacity by increasing essential equipment, drugs, supplies and encouraging staff availability; (3) create robust systems to maintain staff confidence and safety by minimising non-clinical risks and maintaining or escalating essential services; (4) prepare formal reassurance plans for legal protection; (5) provide assistance to staff working outside their normal domains. CONCLUSIONS: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for protection of patients and staff are necessary to optimise outcomes during a pandemic.

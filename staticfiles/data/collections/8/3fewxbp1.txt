We report a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case with rheumatoid arthritis taking iguratimod. The patient who continued iguratimod therapy without dose reduction was treated with ciclesonide had an uneventful clinical course, but prolonged detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was observed after resolution of symptoms. The effects of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and ciclesonide on clinical course and viral shedding remain unknown and warrant further investigation.

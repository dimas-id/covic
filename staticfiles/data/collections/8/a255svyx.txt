The article presents a new method of modeling the spread of fire using Cellular Automata based on 3D mesh. The models based on different heat transport mechanisms were used in the study, including conductivity, convection and thermal radiation. General mechanisms of fire spread are exemplified by a fire inside a building. The tests of the created simulator for fire in rooms were conducted, and the reference point was the known simulator based on CFD, namely FDS Fire Dynamics Simulator.

Certain coatings may improve the biocompatibility of hernia meshes. The coating with self-assembled monolayers, such as glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS) can also improve the materials characteristics of implants. This approach was not yet explored in hernia meshes. It was the aim of this work to clarify if and how hernia meshes with their three-dimensional structure can be coated with GOPS and with which technique this coating can be best characterized. Commercially available meshes made from polypropylene (PP), polyester (PE), and expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) have been coated with GOPS. The coatings were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and cell proliferation test (mouse fibroblasts). Cell viability and cytotoxicity were tested by MTT test. With the GOPS surface modification, the adherence of mouse fibroblasts on polyester meshes and the proliferation on ePTFE meshes were increased compared to noncoated meshes. Both XPS and CLSM are limited in their applicability and validity due to the three-dimensional mesh structure while CLSM was overall more suitable. In the MTT test, no negative effects of the GOPS coating on the cells were detected after 24 h. The present results show that GOPS coating of hernia meshes is feasible and effective. GOPS coating can be achieved in a fast and cost-efficient way. Further investigations are necessary with respect to coating quality and adverse effects before such a coating may be used in the clinical routine. In conclusion, GOPS is a promising material that warrants further research as coating of medical implants. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PURPOSE Laparoscopy-assisted pylorus-preserving gastrectomy has been increasingly reported as a treatment for early gastric cancer located in the middle third of the stomach because of its low invasiveness and preservation of pyloric function. Advantages of a totally laparoscopic approach to distal gastrectomy, including small wound size, minimal invasiveness, and safe anastomosis, have been recently reported. Here, we introduce a new procedure for intracorporeal gastro-gastrostomy combined with totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (TLPPG). METHODS The stomach is transected after sufficient lymphadenectomy with preservation of infrapyloric vessels and vagal nerves. The proximal stomach is first transected near the Demel line, and the distal side is transected 4 to 5 cm from the pyloric ring. To create end-to-end gastro-gastrostomy, the posterior wall of the anastomosis is stapled with a linear stapler and the anterior wall is made by manual suturing intracorporeally. We retrospectively assessed the postoperative surgical outcomes via medical records. The primary endpoint in the present study is safety. RESULTS Sixteen patients underwent TLPPG with intracorporeal reconstruction. All procedures were successfully performed without any intraoperative complications. The mean operative time was 275 min, with mean blood loss of 21 g. With the exception of one patient who had gastric stasis, 15 patients were discharged uneventfully between postoperative days 8 and 11. CONCLUSIONS Our novel hybrid technique for totally intracorporeal end-to-end anastomosis was performed safely without mini-laparotomy. This technique requires prospective validation.

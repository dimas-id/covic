This commentary highlights novel immunomodulation and vaccine-based research against multiple sclerosis (MS) and reveals the amazing story that triggered this cutting-edge MS research in Greece and worldwide. It further reveals the interest and solid support of some of the worldâ€™s leading scientists, including sixteen Nobel Laureates who requested from European leadership to take action in supporting Greece and its universities in the biggest ever financial crisis the country has encountered in the last decades. This support endorsed vaccine-based research on MS, initiated in Greece and Australia, leading to a worldwide network aiming to treat or manage disease outcomes. Initiatives by bright and determined researchers can result in frontiers science. We shed light on a unique story behind great research on MS which is a step forward in our efforts to develop effective treatments for MS.

OBJECTIVE There is little available data on airway humidity during high-frequency ventilation (HFV). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the temperature drop in an endotracheal tube (ETT) during HFV. METHODS We examined the airway temperature in a neonatal HFV system using BabylogÂ® 8000 plus. We measured the temperature change of inspired gases in the ETT under various oscillatory frequencies and oscillatory volumes with a fixed base flow. The temperatures in the ETT during HFV were compared with the temperatures during conventional intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). RESULTS As the oscillatory frequency was increased and the oscillatory volume (VThf) decreased, the difference in temperature between the Y piece and the inlet of an artificial lung in the ETT (ETT outside of body) increased. However, as the oscillatory frequency increased, there was no difference in the ETT temperature under constant oscillatory volume. In contrast, as the oscillatory volume was decreased, the difference in temperature in the ETT was greater under constant oscillatory frequency. Moreover, the temperature drop in the ETT with HFV was lower than that in the IPPV temperature with a similar respiratory volume. CONCLUSIONS The temperature change in the ETT was not dependent on the oscillatory frequency when the oscillatory volume was fixed; however, the temperature was dependent on the oscillatory volume when the oscillatory frequency was fixed.

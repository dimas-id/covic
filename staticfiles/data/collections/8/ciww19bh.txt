While extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an effective method of oxygenation for patients with respiratory failure, further refinement of its incorporation into airway guidelines is needed. We present a case of severe glottic stenosis from advanced thyroid carcinoma in which gas exchange was facilitated by veno-arterial ECMO prior to achieving a definitive airway. We also conducted a systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases, using the keywords "airway/ tracheal obstruction", "anesthesia", "extracorporeal", and "cardiopulmonary bypass" to identify reports where ECMO was initiated as the a priori method of oxygenation during difficult airway management.Thirty-six papers were retrieved discussing the use of ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for the management of critical airway obstruction. Forty-five patients underwent pre-induction of anesthesia institution of CPB or ECMO for airway obstruction. The patients presenting with critical airway obstruction had a range of airway pathologies with tracheal tumours (31%), tracheal stenosis (20%), and head and neck cancers (20%) being the most common. All cases reported a favourable patient outcome with all patients surviving to hospital discharge without significant complications.While most practitioners are familiar with the fundamental airway techniques of bag-mask ventilation, supraglottic airway use, tracheal intubation, and front-of-neck airway access for oxygenation, these techniques have limitations in managing patients with pre-existing severe airway obstruction. The use of ECMO should be considered in patients with severe (or near-complete) airway obstruction secondary to anterior neck or tracheal disease. This approach can provide essential tissue oxygenation while attempts to secure a definitive airway are carried out in a controlled environment.

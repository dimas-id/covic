OBJECTIVE Determining healthcare workers' level of compliance with infection control practices in a Lima hospital during the influenza A(H1N1) epidemic. METHODS A cross-sectional observational study was made of 165 healthcare workers who provided inpatient care in risk areas like emergency services, emergency, intensive care and hospitalisation. The sample size was calculated using EpiInfo software (version 2000) and was based on simple systematic sampling. An ad hoc format validated by experts' judgement was used. RESULTS 23.6 % (39/165) of the respondents washed their hands before and after contact with patients, 72.7 % (96/132) wore gloves for healthcare when so indicated, 61.0 % (64/105) washed their hands after removing gloves, while 58.0 % (76/131) of those who had contact with contaminated material did so after such contact. Only 14.5 % (24/165) of workers engaged in good practice. CONCLUSIONS The percentage of healthcare workers' engaging in infection control practice in the study hospital during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) epidemic was low.

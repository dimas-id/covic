Influenza C virus and a group of coronaviruses, a typical representative of which is bovine coronavirus, use the same strategy for binding to cells. Surface components containing 9-O-acetylated sialic acid are recognized as cellular receptors by these viruses. In addition to the receptor determinant both virus groups have a receptor-destroying enzyme in common, which has been identified as a sialate 9-O-acetylesterase. Differences are, however, found in the distribution of these activities on the viral surface proteins. The influenza C glycoprotein HEF is a multifunctional protein, which is responsible for receptor-binding, receptor-inactivation and fusion. In the case of coronaviruses these activities are functions of two different glycoproteins, S and HE.

This paper proposes a binary pigeon-inspired optimization (BPIO) algorithm, for the quadrotor swarm formation control problem. The expected position is provided by the BPIO. Quadrotor moves to the position with control strategy, and the strategy is based on the proportional integral derivative (PID) control method. The BPIO algorithm which is based on pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm can effectively solve the combination problem in the binary solution space. The BPIO keeps the fast convergence of the PIO, and can explore the space effectively at the same time. The parameters to be optimized are encoded with binary bits. A special fitness function is designed to avoid the happening of crash. The simulation experiment shows how the BPIO works. The results of simulation verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the BPIO to solve the swarm formation problem.

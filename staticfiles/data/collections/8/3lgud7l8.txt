Lower respiratory tract infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Human bocavirus (HBoV) is confirmed to have an association with pediatric lower respiratory tract infection. Seasonal and meteorological factors may play a key role in the epidemiology of HBoV. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the frequency, season, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized children with HBoV infection. In addition, an evaluation of the effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HBoV in a subtropical area in China will be conducted. Children were <14 years in age and hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 in the Respiratory Disease Department at the Children's Hospital affiliated to Soochow University. Multi‐pathogens were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. The association between HBoV activity and regional meteorological conditions was analyzed. The average incidence of HBoV infection was 6.6% (502/7,626). Of the 502 HBoV positive children, the median age was 13 months (range 1–156 months). The HBoV infection rate was highest among the 7–12 months groups (12.9%, 163/1,267). Seasonal distribution of HBoV was noted during June to November, especially during the summer season (June to August). HBoV activity was associated with temperature and humidity although the lag effect between temperature and HBoV activity observed. HBoV is one of the most common viral pathogens in children with lower respiratory tract infection. HBoV infection occurs throughout the year with a peak during the summer. Temperature and humidity may affect the incidence of HBoV. J. Med. Virol. 86:2154–2162, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The ongoing pandemic has stimulated study of the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS), and how it can be manipulated to treat COVID-19. Studies are examining whether drugs that act on the RAAS system might be useful to treat COVID-19. COVID-19 and the RAAS are closely linked both in infection and in possible post-infection inflammatory cascades. We detail the Physiology and Pharmacology of the RAAS including the effects of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide. It is appropriate that the theoretical benefits of modulation of the RAAS should be considered based on available knowledge of the complexity of the system. In this short review we have tried to explain the actions of the angiotensin family of peptides and produce a relatively simple model and diagrammatic summary of the RAAS and the possible sites of intervention.

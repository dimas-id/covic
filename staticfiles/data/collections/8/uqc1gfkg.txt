Stomal prolapse is one of the common complications in transverse colostomy and can be managed conservatively in most cases; however, laparotomy and reconstruction of the stoma may sometimes be required, especially in case of irreducible colostomy prolapse. We have reported a simple local repair with reconstruction of the loop colostomy. We herein report a new more simple technique to avoid laparotomy and allow excision of the irreducible colostomy prolapse and complete closure of the distal limb of loop colostomy when no decompression is required in the distal limb of the stoma. In this procedure, the number of stapler and the time with blood loss for the operation can be saved.

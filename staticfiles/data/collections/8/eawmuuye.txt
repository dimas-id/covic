Abstract A data base for a large diagnostic virology laboratory is described. The system uses a network of personal computers. It allows the entry, long-term storage, and subsequent retrieval of specimen and patient records (comprising personal identifiers and specimen and result information), and hard-copy results reporting. Sited entirely within the laboratory, the network is not connected to a modem. Within the laboratory there is restricted access to human immunodeficiency virus test results to guarantee patient confidentiality. Retention of a hard-copy of specimen request cards ensures the availability of the original clinical information. The data base is copied on a second file server to facilitate searches, and daily streaming onto magnetic tape provides system protection in the event of hard disc failure. Matching of old and new patient records is done by surname, date of birth, and sex, and therefore duplicate records accumulate when patient names are misspelt on specimen request forms. The system requires further development to speed searches of the data base and to achieve automatic generation of laboratory worksheets. Future goals are the replacement of hard-copy records of clinical information and hard-copy reporting with on-line access to hospital data bases and on-line requesting by and reporting to the clinician.

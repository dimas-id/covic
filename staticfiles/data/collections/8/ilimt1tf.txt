In many contexts, medical students collaborate with health care workers to deliver patient management and care in emergencies like the COVID‐19 pandemic. In others, medical students are experiencing an unintended pause in their education due to global university closure over COVID‐19 concerns. In either situation, students find themselves coping with mental and emotional issues, including stress, anxiety, and fear, that may require significant psychological and physical effort. Therefore, it is important that medical schools not only care about students' mental health but also implement strategies to support their understanding of crisis management, self‐mental care, and other principal measures in order to strengthen their coping skills and mental preparedness.

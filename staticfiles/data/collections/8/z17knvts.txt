Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until a vaccine will be available worldwide. Drug repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few number of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors of the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs are proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selected compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19 clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compound has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filtering steps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugs is experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trials without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they are already used as drugs for other diseases.

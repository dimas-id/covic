A novel 5‐membered iminocyclitol derivative was found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the glycoprotein‐processing α‐glucosidase with a K(i) value of 53 nm. This compound was further derivatized to antiviral agents against Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN‐2), human SARS coronavirus, and human β‐hexosaminidase (K(i) =2.6 nm), a new target for the development of osteoarthritis therapeutics.

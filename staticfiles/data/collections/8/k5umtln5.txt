This study aims to investigate the role of politeness in online-tutoring practices by analyzing a large-scale human-human tutorial dialogue dataset. To this end, we employed linguistic theories of politeness to identify the politeness strategies contained in utterances made by tutors and students, and these strategies were further combined to quantify the politeness levels of tutors and students in a tutorial session. The results revealed that tutors had a similar level of politeness at the beginning of all dialogues, while students were more polite at the end if they successfully solved problems.

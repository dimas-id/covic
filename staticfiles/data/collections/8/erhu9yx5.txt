OBJECTIVES To determine whether rhinovirus (RV) species is associated with more severe clinical illness in adults. METHODS Seventy-two RV-positive viral respiratory samples from adult patients were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically after reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the region spanning the VP4 gene and 5' terminus of the VP2 gene. The clinical features and severity of illness associated with the different RV species were compared. RESULTS Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct clusters as RV-A (54%), B (11%), or C (35%) species. In an unadjusted model, patients with RV-B infection were significantly more likely to have the composite outcome variable of death or intensive care unit admission (P=.03), but this effect diminished when controlling for patient sex. A logistic model of the relationship between RV species and adverse outcomes produced nonsignificant odds ratios when controlling for patient sex. CONCLUSIONS Infection with RV-A or RV-B was associated with greater severity of illness in our adult population; however, the association disappeared after controlling for confounders.

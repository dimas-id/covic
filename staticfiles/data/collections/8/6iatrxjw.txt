BACKGROUND Respiratory agents may be detected in the oropharynx of healthy individuals. The extent of this condition and the reasons behind it are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with the presence of respiratory agents in the oropharynx of adolescents healthy enough to attend school activities. METHODS On a single day in December, samples from the posterior wall of the oropharynx of adolescents aged 10-15 y were obtained using cotton-tipped swabs. The samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of 13 respiratory viruses and 2 bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae). RESULTS Out of the 232 adolescents sampled, 67 (29%) had any respiratory symptom. A positive PCR result was found in 50 individuals (22%). Human rhinovirus was the most commonly found agent. Respiratory agents were significantly more frequent in the younger age group (10-13 y) than in the older age group (14-15 y): 26% (38/148) vs 14% (12/84), respectively; p = 0.04. Cough was the only symptom that was more common among individuals with a positive PCR test than among those with a negative PCR test: 8/50 (16%) vs 11/182 (6%); p = 0.02. Family size and class size were not associated with the likelihood of a positive PCR test. CONCLUSIONS The presence of respiratory agents in the oropharynx is a frequent finding among adolescents healthy enough to attend school activities. The high prevalence was found to be associated with young age, but not with the size of the family or class.

PURPOSE To evaluate the advantages of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer in obese patients. METHODS We collected clinical data from consecutive patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer between 2008 and 2015 to compare the surgical outcomes of a laparoscopic surgery group (LG) with those of an open surgery group (OG) stratified by obesity. Obesity was defined as a body mass index â‰¥25. RESULTS A total of 268 patients were analyzed, with 157 in the LG (44 obese and 113 non-obese) and 111 in the OG (25 obese and 86 non-obese). The rates of complications between the LG and the OG were 18.5 vs. 11.6 % (p = 0.18) for the non-obese patients and 18.2 vs. 20.0 % (p = 1.0) for the obese patients, respectively, without a significant difference. Operative time was longer in the LG than in the OG, but the difference between the non-obese and obese patients was not significant, being 266 vs. 189 min (p < 0.0001) and 260 vs. 254 min (p = 0.96), respectively. Blood loss was much lower in the LG for both obese and non-obese patients, being 10 vs. 435 mL (p < 0.0001) and 10 vs. 275 mL (p < 0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSION There were no significant differences between LG and OG in operative time or complications for obese patients with rectal cancer, and blood loss was much lower in the LG. Thus, laparoscopic surgery is a safe and minimally invasive approach for obese patients with rectal cancer.

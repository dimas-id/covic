Two endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are available for use in operative suites for intubation: the Parker Flex-Tip (PFT, Parker Medical) and the standard Mallinckrodt (Covidien). To the authors' knowledge, no study has compared these 2 ETTs with each other when the anesthesia provider uses the GlideScope video laryngoscope (Verathon) for intubation. The purpose of the study was to determine if there are differences related to ease of intubation reported by anesthesia providers who use the PFT tube compared with the standard tube while using the GlideScope. The study was a randomized block intervention design. The sample consisted of 58 observed intubations in an operating room setting. Data analysis was completed with a 2-factor analysis of covariance using 2 covariates. The PFT tube in suboptimal conditions demonstrated a significantly greater ease of intubation, as measured by decreased time for ETT insertion and greater ease of ETT insertion score. The number of redirections at the glottis to intubate the trachea once the glottis was visualized was not statistically different. Based on the findings from this study, anesthesia providers may want to consider the use of the PFT tube when using the GlideScope to promote ease of intubation.

We report a case of an entrapped lung after the pectus bar repair of a pectus deformity. The entrapped lung was found incidentally during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pneumothorax. Based on VATS exploration, multiple bullae seemed to be the cause of the pneumothorax, but the entrapped lung was suspected to have been a cause of the air leakage.

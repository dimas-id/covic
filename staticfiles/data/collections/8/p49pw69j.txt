INTRODUCTION Single incision laparoscopic surgery is being used as an access route for an increasing breadth of surgical cases. However, its use to evaluate and manage postoperative hemorrhage after laparoscopic surgery has not been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION A patient with recurrent cervical dysplasia who had undergone 2 previous cold knife conizations underwent a single incision total laparoscopic hysterectomy with right salpingectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy. On postoperative day 1, she developed signs of intraabdominal hemorrhage. She underwent transcatheter arterial embolization of the left uterine artery and received 3U of packed red blood cells. However, on postoperative day 2, she developed signs of persistent bleeding. DISCUSSION We discuss our management of this case with single incision laparoscopy.

BACKGROUND The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to a major concern and caused a pandemic globally. The goal of this study was to clarify the clinical characteristics of recovery and death in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective single-center study, clinical data were collected from 74 severe or critical COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Fourth Hospital between Jan. 25th and Feb. 26th, 2020. All patients were divided into a recovery group or a death group according to clinical outcomes, and the differences between the groups were compared. RESULTS Of the 74 patients enrolled in the study, 48 (64.9%) were severe cases and 26 (35.1%) were critical cases. Sixty (81.1%) patients were recovered and 14 (18.9%) died. Compared with recovery patients, patients in the death group were older, and had higher incidences of hypertension, coronary disease and dyspnea at admission. Laboratory tests for lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, myoglobin, brain natriuretic peptide and D-dimer indicated higher levels in the death group. The PaO2:FiO2 ratio and minimum SpO2 were lower in the death group, and a higher proportion of these patients received noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 or death. Patients with a low blood gas index and poor coagulation function at admission had a high mortality rate. For such patients, comprehensive treatment should be performed as soon as possible to improve the prognosis and reduce mortality.

The Covid-19 outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 30 January 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to affect more countries worldwide. During this period, our nuclear medicine at Singapore General Hospital segregated our staff and patients either by time, space, or both, to minimise contact and prevent the spread of the virus. We also made necessary changes to clinical practices and enforced strict infection control measures. We share our personal experience in managing a nuclear medicine department during this epidemic.

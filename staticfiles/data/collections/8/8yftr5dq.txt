Over the last decade, the use of electrosurgical devices has become commonplace across all surgical specialities. The current market is large enough to warrant a comparative review of each device. This has even more impetus given the budgetary constraints of NHS organisations. This review aims to compare the benefits and drawbacks of the most popular electrosurgical devices, whilst conducting a critical review of the literature. Structured searches using databases Medline and EMBASE were conducted. The search was restricted to English language papers only. Due to the abundance of literature, this review will focus on common general surgical procedures alone. Despite a plethora of available devices, individual preference still dictates use. Conventional diathermy may always have its place, but may see a decline in use if costs improve. Newer devices have shown comparable precision and added advantages.

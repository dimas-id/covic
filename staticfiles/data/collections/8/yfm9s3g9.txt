The authors report a unique case of an intramedullary cerebellar hemangioblastoma that was supplied by a persistent hypoglossal artery. In this case, recognition of the persistent hypoglossal artery through angiographic imaging was crucial in identifying tumor blood supply and in guiding the decision to perform a craniotomy without tumor embolization.

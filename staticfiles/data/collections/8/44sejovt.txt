Background Endovascular management of wide-necked aneurysms often requires assisted-techniques with adjunctive devices. Wide-necked aneurysm can be defined with a dome-to-neck ratio or aspect ratio; however, clinical definitions of wide-necked aneurysms vary. This study aimed to determine the most useful definition of wide-necked aneurysm to predict the need for an adjunctive device. Methods Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 343 (62.1%) and 209 (37.9%) cases of unruptured and ruptured aneurysms, respectively, were treated in a single institution. For each aneurysm, the (1) dome-to-neck ratio, (2) aspect ratio, and (3) K-ratio (defined as [dome height+maximum dome width]/[2×maximum neck width]) were measured. We statistically analyzed patient data to determine which of the three ratios was most predictive of the need for adjunctive devices. Results Among 552 cases of aneurysms, 277 (50.2%) and 275 (49.8%) cases were treated with and without adjunctive techniques, respectively. The mean dome-to-neck ratio, aspect ratio, and K-ratio were 1.17±0.39, 1.58±0.61, and 1.37±0.47, respectively. The K-ratio was the strongest predictor of the use of adjunctive devices (P<0.001), and 1.3 was the most appropriate K-ratio cut-off value (sensitivity, 72.9%; specificity, 63.6%). Conclusions K-ratio was the most useful predictor of the need for adjunctive devices in the treatment of endovascular aneurysms. These results suggest that the K-ratio may be used to define wide-necked aneurysms requiring complicated management via adjunctive devices.

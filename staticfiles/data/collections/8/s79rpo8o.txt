INTRODUCTION Natural orifice techniques have been developed to reduce incision-related morbidity in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. We describe our method of performing transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic colorectal surgery, addressing bacteriological and oncological concerns in its implementation. METHODS Data of consecutive patients undergoing natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) laparoscopic colorectal surgery in our institution were retrospectively analysed. All specimens were extracted transanally via a wound protector, followed by intracorporeal end-to-end colorectal anastomosis. Perioperative details, microbiological and oncological findings were reviewed. RESULTS Between November 2014 and February 2015, five patients underwent NOSE laparoscopic colorectal procedures in our institution. All cases were completed laparoscopically and specimens were extracted transanally via a wound protector. There were no cases of post-operative anastomotic leaks, wound infections, intra-abdominal sepsis or faecal incontinence. Oncological margins and lymph node harvest were adequate for malignant cases. Transanal specimen extraction did not result in a malignant yield on peritoneal fluid cytology. CONCLUSIONS Early bacteriological, oncological and functional results show that NOSE is safe and feasible. Follow-up is required to establish that long-term oncological outcome is not compromised.

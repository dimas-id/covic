BACKGROUND McBurney's incisional hernia after appendectomy is rare. Although the open surgical approach, either through direct suturing or through mesh repairs, mostly achieves a satisfactory outcome, postoperative wound pain usually impedes patient's early ambulation. Accordingly, laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has emerged as a minimally invasive technique in modern surgical practice. We described a different approach of laparoscopic incisional hernia repair. CASE REPORT A 76-year-old woman with a history of appendectomy presenting with a bulging mass over the right lower quadrant of the abdomen beneath the operation scar was admitted to our hospital. Computed tomography revealed defects in the abdominal muscle layers without evidence of bowel incarceration. The patient was diagnosed with postappendectomy incisional hernia for which laparoscopic hernia repair was performed through a combined intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal approach. The patient's postoperative course was excellent. CONCLUSIONS Combined extraperitoneal approach and intraperitoneal monitoring for McBurney's incisional hernia is feasible in selected cases.

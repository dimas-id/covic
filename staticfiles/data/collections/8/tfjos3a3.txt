The prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus shedding by adult cows was investigated using capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Fecal samples from 121 cows in a single herd were tested for the presence of rotavirus and coronavirus, either free or complexed with immunoglobulin. Free rotavirus was not detected in any samples while rotavirus-immunoglobulin complexes were detected in 53 of 121 (44%) samples tested. In contrast, free coronavirus was detected in six (5%) samples and coronavirus-immunoglobulin complexes were detected in 85 (70%) of the samples tested. Thus it appears that subclinical infection of cows by either of these viruses is common, possibly providing a source for infection of the neonate. These assays may therefore provide important information regarding the epidemiology of enteric virus infections and suggest means of improving management to prevent epidemics of neonatal diarrhea.

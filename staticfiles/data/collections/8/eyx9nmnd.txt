The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has attracted increasing worldwide attention. While metabolic‐associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) affects a quarter of world population, its impact on COVID‐19 severity has not been characterized. We identified 55 MAFLD patients with COVID‐19, who were 1:1 matched by age, sex and obesity status to non‐aged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)‐infected patients without MAFLD. Our results demonstrate that in patients aged less than 60 years with COVID‐19, MAFLD is associated with an approximately fourfold increase (adjusted odds ratio 4.07, 95% confidence interval 1.20‐13.79, P = .02) in the probability for severe disease, after adjusting for confounders. Healthcare professionals caring for patients with COVID‐19 need to be aware that there is a positive association between MAFLD and severe illness with COVID‐19.

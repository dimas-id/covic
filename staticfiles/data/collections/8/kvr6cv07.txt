Time to improvement is a crucial characteristic for effective treatments of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis. Apremilast is a recently approved drug, belonging to the small molecule phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, whose optimal safety and efficacy profile is somewhat affected by slow activity rate in clinical trials. Real world case series are suggesting a more consistent improvement, and with this additional personal investigation on 48 patients, we signal that 58% of patients achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 50, and 19% PASI 75 improvement in the first 8 weeks of treatment. Results at 16-week are remarkable, with overall 55% of patients achieving PASI 75, 21% PASI 90 and 14% PASI 100. Only 8 patients (18, 6%) had slightly improved, although satisfied with the regimen, and determined to continue. Noteworthy, our population was rather problematic in terms of comorbidities (86%), and resistance to other treatments, with only 28% na√Øve to systemics, including biologics. Moreover, the observation period includes the Italian outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic, and further information on apremilast safety are provided, no one of the patients having stopped treatment. In such a critical period, the apremilast satisfactory speed of therapeutic response in a real-world setting has further strengthens patient's compliance to remain safely at home, which is the best strategy to limit contagion.

Abstract Medical readiness in deployed servicemen is based on a policy-driven force health protection approach of physical, dental, and psychological examinations with mandatory investigations and vaccinations. Noncombat-related injuries, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and respiratory disorders represent the leading causes of health issues during deployment. Though much less common, battle injuries have a major physical and psychological impact. Enormous technologic and medical advances have been made in the fields of combat care, rehabilitation medicine, and psychological and social support of the wounded and their families. Although there have been tremendous improvements in hygiene, sanitation, infection control, vaccination, and chemoprophylaxis, preventive measures are not always adequate and can become neglected over time or disrupted during early or most intense stages of military operations. As a result, infectious diseases remain a major challenge for deployed armed forces in the 21st century.

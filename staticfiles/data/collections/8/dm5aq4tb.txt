Treatment of child victims of a bioterrorism attack is complicated because they may be more vulnerable to the agents used and may suffer more complications from the treatment strategies. Isolation and other infection control measures can be psychologically harmful to young children and may require that they undergo sedation. Most of the recommended antibiotics and antiviral treatments for bioterror agents have not been approved for use in children, and children undergoing smallpox vaccination have a higher incidence of complications than adults. Pediatric anesthesiologists should expect to be part of the pediatric care team and must be careful to observe infection control procedures to limit the spread of disease caused by bioterror attack.

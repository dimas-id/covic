We report on an asymptomatic 56-year-old male with incidental diagnosis of celiac trunk aneurysm, diagnosed during an ultrasound scan performed to control polycystic kidney disease. The CT scan revealed a 3.8 cm saccular aneurysm of the celiac artery dissected in the superior wall with a consequent 4.3 cm pseudoaneurysm; we adopted an endovascular approach to exclude the lesion by catheterizing the celiac trunk and positioning a vascular plug in the common hepatic artery and a covered stent in the splenic artery; finally we fulfilled the aneurysm sac with Onyx. 30-day control CT scan revealed procedural success. Five years later he came back to our department for an aneurysm relapse in the common hepatic artery. We performed a second endovascular approach with a superselective catheterization of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade in order to exclude the lesion with Onyx and microcoils. Nowadays the patient is in good clinical conditions. Endovascular approach is a valuable method to treat visceral aneurysms; however, long-term imaging follow-up is essential to monitor the risk of relapse.

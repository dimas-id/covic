The relationship between geology and healing was recognized by ancient people, and medical geology was a popular subject that engaged famous scholars, trained as physicians, from the late-18th to mid-19th centuries. Acceptance of germ theory around 1850 as a major factor in human health shifted the attention to microbes that led to a period of dormancy for medical geology. However, since the 1950s with the advent of precise and accurate analytical techniques, aided by fast computers, geochemists have been able to establish the link between geologic environment and incidence of disease in populations. Medical geology experienced a resurgence around the 1960s, leading to establishment of professional medical geology organizations, specialized courses at universities and colleges, national and international conferences, publication of textbooks, journals, and atlases. This article presents a historical review of medical geology, its evolution, scope and future prospects. Basic principles of medical geology are described and examples of various trace elements on human, and animal health presented. The role of clays in healing and ingestion of clays by humans and animals is examined. Grave and increasing health problems associated with climate change and air pollution from dust and other materials and their impacts on human and ecological health are discussed. Finally, areas of multidisciplinary research opportunities for medical geologists and collaboration with other health, social, and behavioral scientists are identified.

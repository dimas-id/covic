OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise the efficacy and safety of Kangfuxinye enema combined with mesalamine for the ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and in addition to grade the quality of evidence by using the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation) approach. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WanFang Databases. The search restrictions were patients with UC and RCTs. Studies including other treatments except Kangfuxinye with mesalamine were excluded. RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. We found significant benefits of Kangfuxinye combined with mesalamine against mesalamine alone in improving response rate as well as reducing the recurrence rate and inflammation rate; meanwhile, the increase of the adverse events rate was not observed. Furthermore, the symptoms remission rate and the cure time were insignificant statistically. Additionally, GRADE results indicated that the quality of evidence regarding the above 6 outcomes was rated from very low to moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although Kangfuxinye enema seems effective and safe for treating UC patients in this systematic review, Kangfuxinye enema combined with mesalamine was weakly recommended due to very low to moderate quality of available evidence by the GRADE approach.

The case of a 51-year-old man with a large temporal mass is presented. The mass eroded the floor of the middle fossa medially to the sphenoid sinus. A combined approach with neurosurgery and otolaryngology was performed to achieve maximal resection of the mass. Pathology was typical for chondroblastoma: a rare, benign but locally invasive chondroid tumor. Genetic testing revealed a translocation of (2;5) (q33;q13). This is a unique genetic mutation in all chondroid tumors to our knowledge. The diagnostic utility or role of this mutation in the pathobiology of this tumor remains to be determined.

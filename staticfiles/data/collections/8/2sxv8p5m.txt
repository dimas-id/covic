OBJECTIVE Although the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is increasingly performed for morbid obesity, gastric bypass is still considered by many to be the gold standard procedure for obese diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term results of SG in morbidly obese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Diabetic patients who underwent SG at a single center between 2009 and 2011 were included. Outcomes assessed included postoperative complications, weight loss, and resolution or improvement in co-morbidities with an emphasis on diabetes, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and medication status. RESULTS Fifty-one diabetic patients underwent SG, 35 females and 16 males, with a collective mean age of 49 years and a mean body mass index of 43.2 kg/m2. On average, patients had had diabetes for 5.4 ± 7.3 years before surgery. Mean HbA1C and fasting glucose levels were 7.9 ± 1.6% and 166.9 ± 63 mg/dL, respectively. Eleven patients (22%) were insulin dependent at the time of surgery. Average body mass index at a mean follow-up of 5 years after surgery was 34.4 ± 5.8 kg/m2, with an average HbA1C of 6.6 ± 1% and an average fasting glucose of 123 ± 60 mg/dL. Only 3 patients remained insulin dependent. CONCLUSION SG offers retainable weight loss results, accompanied by longstanding resolution or improvement of diabetes. Prospective, randomized controlled studies are warranted to better compare long-term outcomes between SG and gastric bypass.

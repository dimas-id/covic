New cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are reported daily worldwide. What began as a localized outbreak of an epizootic disease has now become a pandemic of unprecedented proportions, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. In South America, as of April 30, 2020, Brazil has the highest number of confirmed cases (n=80 246), followed by Peru (n=36 976) and Ecuador (n=24 934). It is important to note that the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in South America was announced on February 26, 2020, described as an imported case. Local transmission has followed a geometric progression [2].

COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Since its detection in China at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus has rapidly spread throughout the world and has caused an international public health emergency. The most common manifestation is flu-like symptoms. Mild infections usually improve within a few days, but COVID-19 can cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Gastrointestinal symptoms are less common but possible and more difficult to recognize as part of a COVID-19 syndrome. In line with the current opinion of the WHO, we strongly believe that preventive measures and early diagnosis of COVID-19 are crucial to interrupt virus spread and avoid local outbreaks. We report the cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to our Emergency Department who complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at admission. LEARNING POINTS: The novel COVID-19 infection is a severe public health problem which is causing an increasing number of deaths worldwide. Although uncommon, there may be a relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19, as reported in recent studies. Early detection and isolation of patients with COVID-19 infection is the only way to control and limit the global spread of this virus.

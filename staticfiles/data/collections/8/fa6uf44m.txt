This commentary contextualizes potential mental health outcomes for children during and after the COVID-19 pandemic within the risk and resilience literature. Individual, familial, and community-level factors that may increase risk for mental health challenges for children as well as factors associated with positive adaptation in the face of adversity are considered. We highlight the value of considering children's resilience within a systemic perspective by considering family-centered approaches including both short-term and long-term evidence-informed mental health practices.

Multiplex gene assay is a valuable molecular tool not only in academic science but also in clinical diagnostics. Multiplex PCR assays, DNA microarrays, and various nanotechnology-based methods are examples of major techniques developed for analyzing multiple genes; none of these, however, are suitable for point-of-care diagnostics, especially in resource-limited settings. In this report, we describe an octopus-like multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mμLAMP) assay for the rapid analysis of multiple genes in the point-of-care format and provide a robust approach for predicting viruses. This assay with the ability of analyzing multiple genes qualitatively and quantitatively is highly specific, operationally simple, and cost/time-effective with the detection limit of less than 10 copies/μL in 2 μL quantities of sample within 0.5 h. We successfully developed a mμLAMP chip for differentiating three human influenza A substrains and identifying eight important swine viruses.

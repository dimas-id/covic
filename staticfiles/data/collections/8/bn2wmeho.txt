INTRODUCTION Endoscopic treatment of Zenker diverticulum is considered feasible, effective and safe. The use of the Ligasure™ vessel sealer provides adequate and quick dissection of tissue, achieving effective haemostasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective, descriptive study of all patients with Zenker diverticulum who were treated by endoscopic diverticulotomy using Ligasure™. The procedure was performed in the endoscopy unit under deep sedation controlled by the endoscopist. Patients were subsequently admitted for observation and, after discharge, were followed-up in the outpatient clinic. RESULTS Eight patients, 5 women and 3 men, mean age 78±15 years, 25% ASA I, 36% ASA II, 14% ASA III and 25% ASA IV. Main symptom: dysphagia. Diverticula size: 1-7cm. Technical success: 100%. COMPLICATIONS one patient with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Average stay: 24h. Seven patients: asymptomatic; one patient with partial improvement, requiring repeat endoscopic intervention. Surgery and morbidity and mortality: 0%. CONCLUSION The treatment of Zenker diverticulum by endoscopic diverticulotomy using the Ligasure™ vessel sealer is highly effective, fast and safe, and could be considered the treatment of choice.

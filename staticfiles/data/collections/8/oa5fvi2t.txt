On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a new disease caused by a novel virus characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronoavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic. In terms of this ongoing international scenario, we report the situation in Apulia, a region of southern Italy that, as of April 2, has not yet been overwhelmed by this health emergency. In particular, we consider the care models that have been adopted, especially those that manage the requests of cancer patients.

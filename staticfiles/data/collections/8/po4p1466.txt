Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is an isometric, nonenveloped positive-strand RNA virus and a well-studied, representative member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of human, animal, and plant viruses. BMV has been extensively studied as a model for viral RNA replication, gene expression, virus–host interactions, recombination, and encapsidation. Through contributions by many different groups, these studies have not only advanced understanding of BMV, but have also revealed insights and principles extending to many other viruses and to general cellular biology. Among other advances, BMV was used to define the first ribosome binding sites in eukaryotic mRNAs, and to produce the first template-selective eukaryotic viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase extract, the first infectious transcripts from cloned RNA virus cDNA, the first engineered RNA virus expression vectors expressing foreign genes, the first definition of subgenomic mRNA synthesis pathways and determinants, and the first demonstration of higher eukaryotic viral replication in yeast. BMV has also contributed many insights into virion assembly, virus–host interactions, RNA recombination, and RNA replication, including parallels in the replication of positive-strand RNA, reverse-transcribing, and dsRNA viruses. This article reviews the major features of the virus and selected aspects of these and other advances with BMV.

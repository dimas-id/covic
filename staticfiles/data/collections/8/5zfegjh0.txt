Objective: To analyze the application of Kirkpatrick's model in the nurse training program among the emergency surgery department based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019). To provide reference for the training of emergency surgical nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. Design: Guided by Kirkpatrick's model, 35 nurses in the emergency surgery department were trained according to a program that resulted from the clinical demand during the pandemic. The trainees were observed in terms of their performance at reaction level and learning level. Results: At reaction level, the degree of satisfaction scored by nurses was relatively high, with its total score achieving (18.77 Â± 3.09). At learning level, the differences between theoretical and operational scores of tested nurses before and after training proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The application of Kirkpatrick's model based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 confirms to be effective for the training program of nurses in the emergency surgery department. It is also beneficial to improve nurses' knowledge and skills during the pandemic, which serves as a positive influence for clinical reference.

BACKGROUND Dentists' responses to catastrophe have been redefined by bioterrorism. Informed response requires accurate information about agents and diseases that have the potential to be used as weapons. METHODS The authors reviewed information about the most probable bioterrorist weapons (those from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Category A) from the World Wide Web and print journals and distilled it into a resource list that is current, relevant to dentistry and noncommercial. The Web sites cited include those sponsored by federal agencies, academic institutions and professional organizations. The articles cited include those published in English within the last six years in refereed journals that are available in most higher education institutions. RESULTS The authors present the information in a table that provides a quick-reference guide to resources describing agents and diseases with the greatest potential for use as weapons: anthrax, botulism, plague, smallpox, tularemia and viral hemorrhagic fevers. This article presents Web site and journal citations for background and patient-oriented information (fact sheets), signs and symptoms, and prophylactic measures and treatment for each of the agents and diseases. The table facilitates quick access to this information, especially in an emergency. This article also points out guidelines for response should a suspected attack occur. CONCLUSIONS Armed with information about biological weapons, dentists can provide faster diagnosis, inform their patients about risks, prophylaxis or treatment and rethink their own role in terrorism response. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Fast, accurate diagnosis limits the spread of exceptionally contagious diseases. Providing accurate information to patients minimizes misinformation and the associated public fear and panic that, unchecked, could overwhelm health care systems.

Different parasitic life strategies are described including four new life cycles: complex rebrooding, micro-male, mesoparasite and prey-predator transfer. Four new life cycle behaviours are named: nursery hiding, mid-moult stage, positive precursor (intraspecific antagonism) and negative precursor (ambush strategy). Further strategies discussed are opossum attack, double parasitism (doubling of the normal reproductive set), duplex arrangement (separated male-female pairs), simple rebrooding, and describing how displaced parasites and superinfections may partly elucidate life cycles. Proportional stunting masks life history effects of parasitism; cuckoo copepods are true parasites and not just associates; burrowing barnacles (acrothoracicans) are not parasites. Further findings based on life cycle information: branchiurans and pentastomes are possibly not related; firefly seed shrimp are not parasites; copepod pre-adult life cycle stages are common in the western pacific but rare in Caribbean; harpacticoids on vertebrates are not parasites; cuckoo copepods are true parasites; explained the importance of pennellid intermediate hosts. Crustacean parasite life cycles are largely unknown (1% of species). Most crustacean life cycles represent minor modifications from the ancestral free-living mode. Crustacean parasites have less complex and less modified life cycles than other major parasite groups. This limits their exploitation of, and effectiveness, in parasitism. However, these life cycles will be an advantage in Global Change. Most metazoan parasites will be eliminated while crustaceans (and nematodes) will inherit the new world of parasites.

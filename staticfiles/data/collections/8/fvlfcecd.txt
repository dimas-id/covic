A characteristic of bacterial zoonoses, diseases caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans from animals, is a propensity to re-emerge. Several studies demonstrate their ongoing transmission in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa. However, as local epidemiological data on bacterial zoonoses are inadequate the extent and impact of these infectious diseases is under-reported. Consequently, they are not a targeted priority of national public health policies. This limited recognition is despite indications of their possible roles in the widespread prevalence of non-malarial undifferentiated fever in Nigeria. While a number of animal reservoirs and arthropod vectors have been identified in the transmission routes of these diseases, an escalation of cases of undiagnosed febrile illness highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive assessment of other potential reservoirs, vectors and transmission cycles that may increase the local risk of infection with bacterial zoonoses. Animal health interventions have been proposed as a cost-effective strategy. Here, we present a broad overview of bacterial zoonotic infections of humans in Nigeria in the context of evolving epidemiological patterns. Further, we propose that facilitating the operation of a community-based One Health program is essential to providing the comprehensive epidemiological information that is required to improve prioritization of bacterial zoonoses. This would provide a driver for much needed investment in relevant public health interventions in Africa's most populous country.

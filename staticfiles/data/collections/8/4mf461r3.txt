It is thought that there are not enough mechanical ventilators in the U.S. for every patient who may need one during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there is no analysis that measures the potential magnitude of the problem or proposes a solution. In this paper, I combine the pandemic forecasting model used by the federal government with estimates of ventilator availability from the literature to assess the expected shortage under various scenarios. I then propose that the federal government organize a national effort for ventilators to be exchanged between states to take advantage of the inter-temporal differences in demand peaks. I evaluate versions of this proposal, including use of the national stockpile, to estimate the number of lives that could be saved, and observe that it is potentially substantial. In the absence of other viable solutions, the government should begin this effort in earnest, and if not, preparations should be made for such coordination should the country face another pandemic in the future.

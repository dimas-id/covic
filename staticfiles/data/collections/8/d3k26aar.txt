The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought most ongoing clinical trials to a standstill, while at the same time emphasizing the need for new therapeutic treatments and strategies to mitigate the morbidity and mortality related to COVID-19. Recent publication of several observational studies has generated much discussion surrounding efficacy of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and remdesivir, stressing the need for high-quality prospective, randomized control trials in patients with COVID-19. Ongoing ‘Stay at Home’ orders and institutional policies mandating ‘Work from Home’ for non-essential employees, which includes most research personnel, have impacted the ability to implement and conduct clinical studies. This article discusses the approach of an experienced clinical trials unit to make adjustments for ongoing studies and ensure the safety of study participants. At the same time, plans were implemented to continue collection of data to achieve endpoints, safely enroll and follow participants in studies offering potential benefit, and quickly implement new COVID-19 clinical trials. The existence of a Division of Clinical Research with regulatory, budgeting, contracting, and coordinating expertise within a Department of Surgery can successfully accommodate a crisis situation and rapidly adapt to new requirements for the safe, efficient, and effective conversion to a remote work force without compromising the research process.

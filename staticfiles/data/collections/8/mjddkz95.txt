Developing countries, especially those in the tropical regions of the world, are known for poverty and infectious diseases (ID). People in developing countries carry on their day-to-day living amongst these two challenges. Between the years 1940–2004, over 300 emerging human ID have been reported worldwide. Infectious diseases have resulted in high mortality and morbidity in developing countries. Affecting more than 1 billion of the world’s population, neglected tropical diseases (NTD) are a group of infectious diseases that are endemic in the poorest regions of the world. Most of the affected populations live in rural areas with very minimal resources but at high risk of disease due to their livelihood. Non-communicable diseases are also on the increase in developing countries, further exacerbating public health challenges in these regions. With nearly 15 million people dying each year as a result of ID, most of them living in developing countries, there is need to find solutions to prevent and tackle infectious diseases in these communities. This book is devoted to infectious diseases and livelihoods in developing countries.

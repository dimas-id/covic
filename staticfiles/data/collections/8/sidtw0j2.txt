Biological material including microorganisms and toxins can be found in air or the atmosphere, and the study of this area is termed “aeromicrobiology.” Airborne biological materials are known as bioaerosols. This chapter introduces the basics of aeromicrobiology including the nature of bioaerosols and fundamentals of the aeromicrobiological (AMB) pathway. The nature of the atmosphere as a microbial habitat, and the factors that influence microbial survival in the air are described. This is followed by a discussion of extramural aeromicrobiology related to aerosolization of indigenous soil pathogens; influenza pandemics; microbiology in the clouds; agriculture; waste disposal; and airborne toxins. Intramural microbiology within buildings is discussed with respect to public health within buildings, hospitals and laboratories. Finally, measures to control bioaerosols including biosafety in the laboratory are documented.

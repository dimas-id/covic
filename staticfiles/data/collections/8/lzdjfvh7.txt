Advanced nucleic acid-based sensor-applications require computationally intelligent biosensors that are able to concurrently perform complex detection and classification of samples within an in vitro platform. Realization of these cutting-edge computational biosensor systems necessitates innovation and integration of three key technologies: molecular probes with computational capabilities, algorithmic methods to enable in vitro computational post processing and classification, and immobilization and detection approaches that enable the realization of deployable computational biosensor platforms. We provide an overview of current technologies, including our contributions towards the development of computational biosensor systems.

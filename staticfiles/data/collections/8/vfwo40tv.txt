PURPOSE The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a framework from which to measure the outcomes of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS We define the outcomes of recovery from the perspective of different stakeholders and time frames. There is no single definition of recovery. There are overlapping phases of recovery which are of particular interest to different stakeholders (surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, patients and their caregivers), and the primary outcome of interest may vary depending on the phase and the perspective. In the earliest phase (from the end of the surgery to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit [PACU]), biologic and physiologic outcomes are emphasized. In the intermediate phase (from PACU to discharge from the hospital), symptoms related to pain and gastrointestinal function as well as basic activities are important. Studies of ERAS pathways have reported clinical outcomes and symptoms, including complications, hospital stay, mobilization, and gastrointestinal function, largely during hospitalization. Nevertheless, patients define recovery as return to normal functioning, a process that occurs over weeks to months (late phase). Outcomes reflecting functional status (e.g., physical activity, activities of daily living) and overall health (e.g., quality of life) are important in this phase. To date, few studies reporting the effectiveness of ERAS pathways compared with conventional care have included functional status or quality-of-life outcomes, and there is little information about recovery after discharge from hospital. CONCLUSION Recovery after surgery is a complex construct. Different outcomes are important at different phases along the recovery trajectory. Measures for quantifying recovery in hospital and after discharge are available. A consensus-based core set of outcomes with input from multiple stakeholders would facilitate research reporting.

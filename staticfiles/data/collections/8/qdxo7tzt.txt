PURPOSE The 14th Japan-Korea joint symposium on cancer and aging research was held at an auditorium of Saga University, Japan, May 31-Jun 2, 2018. Participants presented 31 oral and 21 poster presentations, two lectures at a luncheon seminar, plus special lectures from two Korean Emeritus Professors and founders of our joint symposia. The essential parts of the lectures are reviewed here. RESULTS This Symposium was called Japan-Korea, because the host country comes first. Our symposia are organized every 18 months and the program includes keynote and plenary lectures, and oral and poster presentations. (1) Subjects related to cancer development at this symposium were: prostate cancer progression, molecules activating GSK3Î², suppressing the activation of cancer stem cells, profiling human B cell receptor repertoires, and hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndrome. (2) Subjects related to treatment were: G-quadruplex ligands for glioma stem cells, tankyrase inhibitor for colorectal cancer, and eradication of ATL. (3) Cancer prevention subjects were: physical adsorption of EGCG to cell membrane, inhibition of immune evasion of cancer cells with EGCG, and prevention with antidiabetic agents. (4) Aging subjects were life span extension with Toll-like receptor 5 vaccine and reversal of senescence with inhibitors of ATM and ROCK. (5) The results of epidemiology focused on aldehyde dehyrogenase-2 and alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION The 14th symposium demonstrated the cutting-edge of presentations with discussion of numerous ideas by the participants.

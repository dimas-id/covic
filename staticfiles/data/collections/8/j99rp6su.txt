This article attempts to cover the most common problems likely to present in neonatal crias and to give guidance on how to approach these cases, particularly how to stabilize the acute presentation of a sick neonate. It is impossible to cover every eventuality and it is important to keep an open mind when evaluating and treating sick neonatal camelids. Despite the often moribund presentation of sick neonatal crias, they may be highly rewarding to treat, although hospitalization and 24-hour care is recommended.

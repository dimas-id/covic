China’s political and administrative systems are mysteries to many Westerners. At one level, China is a one-party state that has been ruled by the Chinese Communist Party since 1949. In the late 1950s, the same authoritarian regime was waging a massive campaign under the name of the ‘Great Leap Forward’, which resulted in the loss of a large number of lives. From 1966 to 1976, the same regime was launching a so-called ‘Great Cultural Revolution’, causing serious cultural and economic damages to this nation. Furthermore, influential theories of the political economy of the former socialist systems emphasize that unless the one-party monopoly is abolished, reforms are doomed to fail. Obviously, the achievements of China’s modernization defy conventional explanations. Consequently, this will lead to the asking of questions such as: How has the Chinese political system worked during the past decades? Can it be sustained in the long run?

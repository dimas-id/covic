• Authorities of Iran University of Medical Sciences decided to invite all of medical faculty members as well as medical trainees, regardless to their specialty to shift-work in the emergency and inpatient COVID-19 special wards. • Following this decision, 12 psychiatric trainees were scheduled to visit patients with COVID-19. • After the shift, trainees were asked to fill out an online anonymous form and submit their written comments. The present letter is the result of this brief survey. • Less than 42% answered they volunteered for the shift, as well as, only 16.7% would be volunteer if be asked again. • Only 16.7% of them showed their interest to visit the COVID-19 patients again for medical management, whereas more than 83% of them expressed their readiness to handle psychiatric problems of these patients. • We conclude that although all medical personnel should be sufficiently prepared for critical conditions, it seems better that mental health personnel be involved in more specialized tasks.

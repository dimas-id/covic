OBJECTIVE To evaluate a modified technique of laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) on rates of postoperative cyclic bleeding (PCB). METHODS A retrospective study was conducted of 173 women who underwent LSH with bipolar electrocoagulation of the endocervical canal at Landeskrankenhaus Wolfsberg, Wolfsberg, Austria, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009. Long-term follow-up was assessed using a questionnaire. A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis of 13 studies that reported on PCB after LSH were also conducted. RESULTS In all, 164 women (94.8%) had uneventful intraoperative and postoperative courses. By contrast, 9 of 146 premenopausal women (6.2%) experienced PCB. The meta-analysis (n=1822) revealed an overall PCB rate of 7.1%. Bipolar electrocoagulation of the endocervical canal was the most effective method for prevention of PCB (bleeding rate, 2.9%) followed by unipolar electrocoagulation (bleeding rate, 9.9%). Uterine resection below the internal cervical orifice was more effective for preventing PCB (13 of 633 women; 2.1%) than either amputation at this site or above this site (27 of 537 women [5.0%] and 88 of 640 women [13.8%]). CONCLUSION Bipolar coagulation of the endocervical canal and extensive resection with amputation below the level of the internal cervical orifice were effective for reducing rates of PCB.

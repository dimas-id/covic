As one of the two methods for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), gene sequencing is different from quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in detection principles. Therefore, gene sequencing has its own pros and cons in clinical application. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is the most commonly used technology in clinical application. Due to its broad coverage of all types of pathogens, mNGS demonstrates incomparable advantage in rapid identification of novel pathogens such as 2019-nCoV. In addition, it can simultaneously identify other pathogens except 2019-nCoV and mixed infections. On the other hand, however, due to the complexity of mNGS and long detection time, it is unlikely to achieve the purpose of wide-range and rapid diagnosis of 2019 n-CoV. Therefore, mNGS can complement RT-PCR to achieve best clinical application.

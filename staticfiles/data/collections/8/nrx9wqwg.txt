Coronaviruses are a class of virus responsible of the recent outbreak of Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The molecular machinery behind the viral entry and thus infectivity is based on the formation of the complex of virus spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The detection of putative allosteric sites on the viral spike protein can trace the path to develop allosteric drugs to weaken the strength of the spike-ACE2 interface and, thus, reduce the viral infectivity. In this work we present results of the application of the Protein Contact Network (PCN) paradigm to the complex SARS-CoV spike - ACE2 relative to both 2003 SARS and the recent 2019 - CoV. Results point to a specific region, present in both structures, that is predicted to act as allosteric site modulating the binding of the spike protein with ACE2.

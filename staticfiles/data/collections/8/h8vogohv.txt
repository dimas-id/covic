BACKGROUND Retraction of the liver is necessary to ensure an adequate working space in laparoscopic surgery, but the retraction force applied may cause transient liver dysfunction. We have introduced the technique using a Penrose drain to suspend the liver with the performance of laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma. METHODS 111 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy using either a Penrose drain (n = 47) or a Nathanson's retractor (n = 64) for displacement of the liver. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin were compared among the groups at baseline, immediately after operation, and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS The levels of ALT on POD 2, 3, and 5 were significant higher in the Nathanson's retractor group than in the Penrose drain group. Levels of AST on POD 2 and 3 were also higher in the Nathanson's retractor group than in the Penrose drain group. There was no significant difference in total bilirubin, ALP, and serum albumin levels between groups. CONCLUSIONS The use of the Penrose drain for retraction of the liver appears to attenuate postoperative liver dysfunction during laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma.

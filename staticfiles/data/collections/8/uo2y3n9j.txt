The field of "One Health" encourages researchers to collaborate across a wide range of disciplines to improve health at the animal-human-ecosystems interface. One Health recognizes the potential of emerging infectious diseases to impact public health and global food security, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to counteract the effect of these diseases. Vaccinologists are also beginning to engage in research related to One Health, recognizing that preventing transmission of emerging infectious diseases at the animal-human interface is critically important for protecting the world population from epizootics and pandemics. In this synopsis of recent work in the One Health field, we describe some emerging One Health pathogens, discuss the importance of One Health to food safety and biodefense, propose strategies for improving One Health including the development of new vaccines and new vaccine design approaches, and close with a brief discussion of the opportunities and risks related to One Health vaccine research.

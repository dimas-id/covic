INTRODUCTION Inappropriate gestational weight gain (GWG), including inadequate and excessive GWG, has become pandemic across nations and continents. This review aims to synthesise the evidence on the correlation between diet quality and GWG. If this association is confirmed, improving diet quality could become an intervention target in the efforts to reduce inappropriate GWG. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review of all prospective cohort studies on diet quality in preconception or pregnancy and GWG. Our secondary outcomes include gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and birth weight. A comprehensive search of all published articles in MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Food Science and Technology Abstracts (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCOHost), from database creation to 20 April 2019, will be conducted. Studies will be screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Study quality and risk of bias will be assessed using the adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results will be reported following the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines. If sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the effect size reported as OR with 95% CI using both fixed-effect and random-effect models. I2 statistics and visual inspection of the forest plots will be used to assess heterogeneity and identify the potential sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias will be assessed by visual inspections of funnel plots and Egger's test. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Formal ethical approval is not required as no primary data will be collected. We aim to publish the results of this study in a peer-reviewed journal and present them at conferences and scientific meetings to promote knowledge transfer.

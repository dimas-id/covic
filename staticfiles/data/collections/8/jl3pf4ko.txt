Publisher Summary The flavivirus genome is a capped, positive-sense RNA approximately 10.5 kb in length. It contains a single long open reading frame (ORF), flanked by a 5´ noncoding regions (NCR), which is about 100 nucleotides in length, and a 3´ NCR ranging in size from about 400 to 800 nucleotides in length. The conserved structural and nucleotide sequence elements of these NCRs and their function in RNA replication and translation are the subjects of this chapter. The 5´ and 3´ NCRs play a role in the initiation of negative-strand synthesis on virus RNA released from entering virions, switching from negative-strand synthesis to synthesis of progeny plus strand RNA at late times after infection, and possibly in the initiation of translation and in the packaging of virus plus strand RNA into particles. The presence of conserved and nonconserved complementary nucleotide sequences near the 5´ and 3´ termini of flavivirus genomes suggests that ‘‘panhandle’’ or circular RNA structures are formed transiently by hydrogen bonding at some stage during RNA replication.

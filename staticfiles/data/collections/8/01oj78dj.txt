Avidin layer was bound on the substrate surface of Silicon wafer modified with aldehyde. The interaction between avidin and biotin was adopted for the immobilization of mouse monoclonal biotin-anti-M13 (antibody GP3)-labeled biotin. The surface was incubated in a solution containing phage M13KO7, which was trapped by the antibody GP3 with the interaction between phage M13KO7 and antibody GP3, resulting in a variation of layer thickness that was detected by imaging ellipsometry. The results showed a saturated layer of antibody GP3 with a thickness about 6.9 nm on the surface of the silicon wafer. The specific interaction between phage M13KO7 and antibody GP3 resulted in a variation of layer thickness. The layer of phage M13KO7 bound with antibody GP3 was 17.5 nm in the concentration of 1.1×10(10) pfu/mL. Each variation of the layer thickness corresponded to a concentration of phage M13KO7 in the range of 0.1×10(10)–2.5×10(10) pfu/mL, with the sensitivity of 10(9) pfu/mL. Compared with other methods, the optical protein-chip, requiring only short measurement time, label free, is a quantitative test, and can be visualized. This study could be significant on the interactions between the antibody and the virus, showing potential in the early diagnosis of virosis.

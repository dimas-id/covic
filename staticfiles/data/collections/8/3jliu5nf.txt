The full-length cDNA clone of swine vesicular disease virus HK/70 strain named pSVOK(12) was constructed in order to study the antigenicity, replication, maturation and pathogenicity of swine vesicular disease virus. In vitro transcription RNA from pSVOK(12) transfected IBRS-2 cells and the recovered virus RNA were isolated and sequenced, then indirect hemagglutination test, indirect immunofluorescence assays, eleectron microscope test, 50% tissue culture infecting dose (TCID(50)) assays and mouse virulence studies were performed to study the antigenicity and virulence of the recovered virus. The result showed that the infectious clones we obtained and the virus derived from pSVOK(12) had the same biological properties as the parental strain HK/70. The full-length infectious cDNA clone, pSVOK(12), will be very useful in studies of the antigenicity, virulence, pathogenesis, maturation and replication of SVDV.

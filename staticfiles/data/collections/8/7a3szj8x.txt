Abstract Individuals who visit community pharmacies are regarded as customers rather than patients. The public tends to view community pharmacists as businesspeople. Several factors influence individuals' willingness to patronize and to continue visiting such pharmacies. On the supply side, community pharmacists' responsibilities and duties center on the health and well-being of society. In this chapter, an assessment of community pharmacy practices in developing countries is particularly interesting in terms of medication dispensing and extended pharmacy services that promote public wellness. Community pharmacists in developing countries, who are supposedly strategically positioned in the community to provide public health, are not taking advantage on this opportunity. Although several studies have noted the services provided by community pharmacists, in general, the practice is far from meeting expectations due to several barriers. Pharmacists need to realize their opportunities and potential for success as both professionals and businesspeople.

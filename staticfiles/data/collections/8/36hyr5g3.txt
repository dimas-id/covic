BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative use of renin angiotensin system antagonists has been considered an independent risk factor for development of vasoplegic syndrome. The aim of this study was to demonstrate efficacy of prophylactic terlipressin infusion for prevention of vasoplegic syndrome in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blocker undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred patients on angiotensin II receptor antagonist [losartan] scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled into this prospective randomized controlled study. Anesthetic technique, surgical technique, and cardiopulmonary bypass management were standardized for all patients. With the start of rewarming, patients were randomized to receive either terlipressin infusion 1.3 μg.kg(−1).hour(−1), or normal saline infusion. Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome score was used as primary outcome. Hemodynamic parameters, inotropic score, and vasopressor dependency index were used as secondary outcome. RESULTS: Incidence of vasoplegic syndrome was significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group. Norepinephrine was required in 2 patients of terlipressin versus 15 patients of placebo group. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly higher in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (81.7 ± 18.5 versus 69.3 ± 20.2 at 60 min after weaning from CBP). Cardiac index was significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (2.52 ± 1.48 versus 3.2 ± 1.55). Systemic vascular resistance was significantly higher in terlipressin group compared to placebo group (2438.09 ± 735.13 versus 1575.05 ± 753.54). Inotropic score and vasopressor dependency index were significantly lower in terlipressin group compared to placebo group. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic terlipressin infusion could prevent development of vasoplegic syndrome in patients treated with angiotensin II receptor antagonist undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

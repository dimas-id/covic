The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has created a deadly pandemic that is now significantly impacting the United States. Otolaryngologists are considered high risk for contracting disease, as the virus resides in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, and oropharynx. While valuable work has been publicized regarding several topics in Rhinology, we discuss other aspects of our specialty in further detail. There are several issues regarding Rhinologic practice that need to be clarified both for the current epidemic as well as for future expected “waves.” In addition, as the pandemic dies down, guidelines are needed to optimize safe practices as we start seeing more patients again. These include protocols pertinent to safety, in-office Rhinologic procedures, the substitution of imaging for endoscopy, and understanding the appropriate role of telemedicine. We discuss these aspects of Rhinology as well as practical concerns relating to telemedicine and billing, as these issues take on increasing importance for Rhinologists both in the present and the future.

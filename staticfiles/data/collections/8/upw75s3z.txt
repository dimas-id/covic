We have reported that, in addition to recapitulating the classical human Gaucher disease (GD1) phenotype, deletion of the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene in mice results in the dysfunction of a diverse population of immune cells. Most of immune-related, non-classical features of GD1, including gammopathies and autoimmune diathesis, are resistant to macrophage-directed therapies. This has prompted a search for newer agents for human GD1. Here, we used high-density microarray on splenic and liver cells from affected GBA1(−/−) mice to establish a gene “signature”, which was then utilized to interrogate the Broad Institute database, CMAP. Computational connectivity mapping of disease and drug pairs through CMAP revealed several highly enriched, non-null, mimic and anti-mimic hits. Most notably, two compounds with anti-helminthic properties, namely albendazole and oxamniquine, were identified; these are particularly relevant for future testing as the expression of chitinases is enhanced in GD1.

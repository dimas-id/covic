BACKGROUND Periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics (PAOO) is a treatment for bone defects associated with a lack of bone graft stability, especially in coronal locations. This study aimed to compare a modified technique of membrane fixation that utilizes periosteal sutures (using a pouch design) with the traditional approach, which does not use membrane fixation. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with a total of 168 teeth treated were divided into two groups: 1-A, in which patients were treated using the modified technique (with membrane fixation), and group 2-B, in which patients were treated using the traditional technique (without membrane fixation). The postoperative bone thickness was evaluated via radiographic examination. RESULTS Postoperative improvements in bone augmentation were detected in both groups. At 12 months, the values of the CHBT (measured from the midpoint of the coronal third to the labial cortical surface, 0.84 ± 0.33 mm) and the values of VBL (measured from the alveolar crest to the cemento-enamel junction, - 2.35 ± 0.80 mm)were significantly greater in the modified technique group than those in the traditional technique group (CHBT:0.12 ± 0.21 mm and VBL:-1.39 ± 0.99 mm; P = 0.00 and P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study shows that compared to the traditional technique, the modified PAOO technique with membrane fixation using periosteal sutures provides improved graft stabilization, superior coronal augmentation and satisfactory vertical volume.

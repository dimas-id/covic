BACKGROUND One of the most common problems faced in laparoscopic treatment of hydatid cysts is the difficulty in evacuating the particulate contents (daughter cysts and laminated membrane). Although various instruments and laparoscopic techniques have been described to evacuate the contents of hydatid cysts, most are not available at many surgical centers. METHODS By assembling disposable, cheap, and available anesthesia equipment with common laparoscopic instruments, a laparoscopic system was made to evacuate the contents of a hydatid cyst. Ten patients with hepatic hydatid disease underwent laparoscopic surgery using this new hydatid system between June 2011 and January 2013. RESULTS The procedure was completely straightforward. Twelve hydatid cysts (2 patients had 2 separated cysts) were evacuated without any spillage. All patients were followed for at least 8 months, with no evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS This simple apparatus, which can be assembled anywhere, was safely used to evacuate the contents of hydatid cysts without causing any spillage.

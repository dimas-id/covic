In the past two decades tissue adhesives and sealants have revolutionized bleeding control and wound healing. This paper focuses on existing tissue adhesive design, their structure, functioning mechanism, and their pros and cons in wound management. It also includes the latest advances in the development of new tissue adhesives as well as the emerging applications in regenerative medicine. We expect that this paper will provide insightful discussion on tissue bioadhesive design and lead to innovations for the development of the next generation of tissue bioadhesives and their related biomedical applications.

Data concerning the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients are lacking. We report a three-family cluster of infections involving asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic transmission. Eight (53%) of 15 members from three families were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of eight patients, three were asymptomatic and one was paucisymptomatic. An asymptomatic mother transmitted the virus to her son, and a paucisymptomatic father transmitted the virus to his three-month-old daughter. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the environment of one household. The complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients were >99.9% identical and were clustered with other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China and other countries.

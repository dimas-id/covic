We identified a strain of betacoronavirus BtKY72/Rhinolophus sp./Kenya/2007 (here BtKY72) from rectal swab samples in Kenyan bats. This paper reports the complete genomic sequence of BtKY72, which is closely related to BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related virus from Rhinolophus bats in Europe.

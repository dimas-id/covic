Despite the concern over the potential loss of structural information as a result of the use of peptides as opposed to proteins as molecular probes, peptide arrays have been implemented in a broad range of applications including antibody screening and epitope mapping, characterization of molecular interactions, and enzymatic activity profiling, and they have become a valuable tool for proteomics research. In this chapter, we first (Sect. 7.1) recapitulate the development of these arrays and highlight a couple of key improvements in the array production and the application in proteomics research. For clinical and biomarker development applications, it is important to measure entities that are directly related to physiological function (and dysfunction). In this respect, the assessment of enzymatic activities is obviously preferable to genotyping, expression profiling, or even measurement of protein amounts. In Sect. 7.2, an original technology based on peptides arrayed onto a porous support allows detailed profiling of kinase activities in a biological sample. The applications described range from kinase characterization to inhibition profiles, detection of off-target effects, and drug response prediction in a clinical setting, allowing rational choice of the drug to be used. Such directly functional approaches will have an important role in the transition to more personalized medicine. Finally, in Sect. 7.3, a recently developed method for “laser printing” of peptide arrays that will make these approaches much more practical is presented.

An 8-year-old, 125 kg (275 lb) female miniature horse was evaluated for a persistently thickened left mandible and cutaneous fistula. Pulp horn defects were identified in pulp horns 1 and 3 of tooth 309 and occlusal pulp exposure was detected with a dental explorer. Radiography of the left mandibular dental quadrant revealed changes consistent with apical infection of tooth 309. Following the failure of oral extraction, a standing surgical approach was taken for transcutaneous lateral alveolar ostectomy and extraction. Roots were sectioned at the level of the furcation and elevated from the surgical site, and the remaining reserve crown was luxated and repulsed into the oral cavity. Healing of the surgical site and alveolus was uncomplicated.

Peritoneal inclusion cysts are uncommon lesions that usually occur in the pelvis of reproductive-age females. The case of a 7-year-old girl with an inflamed peritoneal inclusion cyst with unusual right paracolic localization and congenital lower extremity superficial and deep venous valve agenesis is presented. Inflammation of the peritoneal inclusion cyst was responsible for the signs of acute abdomen and subsequent presentation at our center. The cystic structure was initially diagnosed using ultrasonography, and its complete extent (8cm x 6.5cm x 4cm) was evident after magnetic resonance imaging. The minimal access approach was opted for to resect the entire cyst from the lateral border of the ascending colon. Afterwards, the cyst was punctured to reduce its size and to retrieve the cyst wall using an endoscopic specimen retrieval bag. Minimal access surgery precautions in this patient with congenital lower extremity venous valve agenesis are discussed.

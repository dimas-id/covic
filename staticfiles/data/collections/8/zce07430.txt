OBJECTIVE To compare Sonicision cordless ultrasonic dissector (SCUD) to LigaSure vessel sealing device (LVSD) for laparoscopic ovariectomy (Lap OVE) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN Randomized, paired prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Client-owned dogs (n = 22) presented for elective Lap OVE. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two protocols: protocol 1 required the left ovary resected using SCUD and the right ovary using LVSD; protocol 2 required the left ovary resected using LVSD and the right ovary using SCUD. Duration of ovary excision, complications, surgical smoke production, and collateral thermal damage were compared between SCUD and LVSD. Total surgery duration, postoperative convalescence, obesity, mesovarial fat score, and technique-associated costs were also recorded. RESULTS Ovary excision was significantly faster with LVSD than SCUD. Surgical smoke production was significantly greater for SCUD than LVSD. Minor pedicle hemorrhage occurred 3 times with SCUD and one time with LVSD (not significantly different) and was easily corrected intraoperative. Presence of hemorrhage significantly increased ovary excision time. Technique-associated costs were lower for SCUD than LVSD. No significant differences were found in collateral thermal damage between SCUD and LVSD. Total surgery duration and convalescence time were similar to previous reports of Lap OVE in dogs at the authors' institution. CONCLUSIONS SCUD is a cost-effective alternative for Lap OVE, taking into account differences in technique and user preference.

Paulownia species, especially their flowers and fruits, are traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases. C-geranylated flavonoids were found to be the major special metabolites in Paulownia flowers and fruits, and 76 C-geranylated flavonoids had been isolated and characterized thus far. Structural variations in Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids are mainly due to the complicated structural modifications in their geranyl substituents. These natural compounds have attracted much attention because of their various biological activities, including antioxidation, anti-inflammation, cytotoxic activity and various enzymatic inhibitions, etc. Among them, diplacone, a major Paulownia component, was considered to have promise for applications in medicine. This paper summarizes the information from current publications on Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids, with a focus on their structural variety, key spectroscopic characteristics, biological activity with structureâ€“activity relationships and application prospects. We hope that this paper will stimulate further investigations of Paulownia species and this kind of natural product.

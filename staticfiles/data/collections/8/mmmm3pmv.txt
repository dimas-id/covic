The crafting of sensor material of desired features has always remained a challenging task in the field of material designing and predominantly becomes more interesting when analyte belongs to biospecies. Label-free detection of different bioanalytes such as enzymes, viruses, microorganisms, and blood groups through mass-sensitive transducers has gained considerable importance in the development of modern biosensors. Analyte molecules interact with the surface of sensitive layer coated on these devices and as a result of this interaction, the frequency change is determined, which provides quantitative information about the mass of analyte. One of the most vital elements of these detection systems is to design selective sensor coatings through control surface structuring at nanoscale. Molecular imprinting has proven to be a highly suitable technique to generate selective surfaces that are capable of detecting different analytes, quantitatively and qualitatively as well. The tailor-made synthetic antibody cavities are rigid and stable, which are not immediately collapsed upon analyte interaction; moreover, the different bioanalytes do not undergo any phase change and maintain their original identity during analysis. This chapter will discuss the contribution of imprinting methods to design optimized surfaces for mass-sensitive detection of diverse biological species.

Proteins represent the tools and appliances of the cell â€” they assemble into larger structural elements, catalyze the biochemical reactions of metabolism, transmit signals, move cargo across membrane boundaries and carry out many other tasks. For most of these functions proteins cannot act in isolation but require close cooperation with other proteins to accomplish their task. Often, this collaborative action implies physical interaction of the proteins involved. Accordingly, experimental detection, in silico prediction and computational analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) have attracted great attention in the quest for discovering functional links among proteins and deciphering the complex networks of the cell.

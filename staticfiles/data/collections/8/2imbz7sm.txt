Should health care workers (HCWs) tell the truth? The answer seems definite to be yes since every medical and nursing staff has taken an oath to the Hippocratic Oath or Nightingale Florence Pledge that only integrity and honesty deserve the trust of patients and commitment of saving life. HCWs who work within the medical system in normal times should follow biomedical ethics, and their primary responsibility is to safeguard the health rights and interests of individual patients.

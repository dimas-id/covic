Riesz wavelets in [Formula: see text] have been proven as a useful tool in the context of both pure and numerical analysis in many applications, due to their well prevailing and recognized theory and its natural properties such as sparsity and stability which lead to a well-conditioned scheme. In this paper, an effective and accurate technique based on Riesz wavelets is presented for solving weakly singular type of fractional order integro-differential equations with applications to solve system of fractional order model that describe the dynamics of uninfected, infected and free virus carried out by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The Riesz wavelet in this work is constructed via the smoothed pseudo-splines refinable functions. The advantage of using such wavelets, in the context of fractional and integro-differential equations, lies on the simple structure of the reduced systems and in the powerfulness of obtaining approximated solutions for such equations that have weakly singular kernels. The proposed method shows a good performance and high accuracy orders.

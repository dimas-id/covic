Abstract Background There is a growing number of reports of COVID-19 cases presenting gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Aims To review studies reporting GI symptoms among COVID-19 patients. Results Fifteen papers (2800 patients) were identified. Frequency of GI symptoms varied from 3.0% to 39.6%, including diarrhea: 7.5%, nausea: 4.5%, anorexia: 4.4%, vomiting: 1.3%, abdominal pain: 0.5%, belching/reflux: 0.3%. These may be the first manifestation of COVID-19, however, there is controversy whether these reflect better or worst prognosis. Finally, the potential relationship with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor in the digestive tract as the virus entry route, is discussed. Conclusions GI symptoms may be common in COVID-19 may be the first manifestation before fever and respiratory symptoms. Therefore, clinicians and gastroenterologists need to be aware of these atypical cases during the current pandemic and of the fecalâ€“oral transmission, and preventive measures may be implemented.

Currently, COVID‐19 has been reported in nearly all countries globally. To date, little is known about the viral shedding duration, clinical course, and treatment efficacy of COVID‐19 near Hubei Province, China. This multicentre, retrospective study was performed in 12 hospitals in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces from January 20 to February 8, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up until March 26, 2020. The viral shedding duration, full clinical course, and treatment efficacy were analysed in different subgroups of patients. A total of 149 COVID‐19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years, and 61.1% (91) were males. Of them, 133 (89.3%) had fever, 131 of 144 (91%) had pneumonia, 27 (18.1%) required intensive care unit (ICU) management, 3 (2%) were pregnant, and 3 (2%) died. Two premature newborns were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2. In total, the median SARS‐CoV‐2 shedding period and clinical course were 12 (IQR: 9‐17; mean: 13.4, 95% CI: 12.5, 14.2) and 20 (IQR: 16‐24; mean: 21.2, 95% CI: 20.1, 22.3) days, respectively; and ICU patients had longer median viral shedding periods (21 [17‐24] vs 11 [9‐15]) and clinical courses (30 [22‐33] vs 19 [15.8‐22]) than non‐ICU patients (both p<0.0001). SARS‐CoV‐2 clearances occurred at least 2 days before fatality in 3 non‐survivors. Current treatment with any antiviral agent or combination did not present the benefit of shortening viral shedding period and clinical course (all p>0.05) in real‐life settings. In conclusion, the viral shedding duration and clinical course in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces were shorter than those in Hubei Province, and current antiviral therapies were ineffective for shortening viral shedding duration and clinical course in real‐world settings. These findings expand our knowledge of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and may be helpful for management of the epidemic outbreak of COVID‐19 worldwide. Further studies concerning effective antiviral agents and vaccines are urgently needed.

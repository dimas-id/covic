Concerns have been raised about the potential for renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors to upregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and thus increase susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry. Currently, there is no evidence that even if RAS inhibitors increase expression and activity of ACE2, that they would increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating greater viral entry or worsen outcomes in patients with COVID-19. At this time, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors should be discontinued in stable patients with COVID-19. In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, decisions about these medications should be based on clinical condition, including hemodynamic status and renal function.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the effects of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on oxygenation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients, and to discuss the timing point for mechanical ventilation. METHODS Twenty-five SARS patients with respiratory dysfunction treated with NIPPV were studied retrospectively in order to evaluate the influences within 24 hours after initiation of ventilatory support on their physiological indices and oxygenation. Patients with SARS were divided into two groups: survivor group (n=13) and non-survivor group (n=12). We compared the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHEII) score, respiratory rate (RR),saturation of oxygen (SpO(2)) and modificative respiratory index (MRI) for the survivors and non-survivors before NIPPV and after NIPPV for twenty-four hours, respectively. RESULTS Although NIPPV administered via full-face masks might be an effective treatment for rapidly improving vital signs and gas exchange and sense of dyspnea in both groups during the initial 24 hours of ventilatory support, the patients in non-survivor group had higher APACHEII score, respiratory rates and lower SpO(2), MRI than the patients in survivor group (P<0.05) at the same intervals after initiation of support. CONCLUSION Noninvasive ventilation should be used as a substitutive tool for endotracheal intubation an alternative treatment for acute respiratory failure related to SARS. Therefore, we should make efforts to avoid missing the time point for NIPPV or intubation, and we should not be restricted to the available indications for NIPPV or IPPV.

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) a pandemic. Recently, Hermans, et.al., outlined the challenges the COVID‐19 pandemic pose for the bleeding disorders community (1). The general response to the pandemic has included increased measures focused on personal hygiene, social distancing, symptom monitoring, early diagnosis, patient isolation, shelter in place, and public health quarantine. Accordingly, such measures have led to concerns over how to maintain access to haemophilia treatment products and to the specialized integrated care medical follow up within the haemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). As part of the medical response to disasters such as a world‐wide pandemic, telemedicine has emerged as one proposed solution to address this type of global challenge (2).

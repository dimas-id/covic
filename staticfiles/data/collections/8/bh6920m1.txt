Rhinovirus infections cause exacerbations of eosinophilic airway disease. The acute effects of allergen-challenge on nasal interleukin-8 (IL-8), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and alpha2-macroglobulin were examined in atopic subjects with common cold symptoms. Twenty-three patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were inoculated with human rhinovirus 16 outside the pollen season. Diluent and allergen challenges, followed by nasal lavages, were carried out about 3 months before and 4 days after virus inoculation. Seventeen patients developed significant common cold symptoms with increased nasal lavage fluid levels of alpha2-macroglobulin, IL-8, and ECP at baseline (p<0.001-0.05 versus before inoculation), and were further increased by allergen challenge (p< 0.001-0.05); IL-8 and ECP levels were correlated (r = 0.63, p<0.001). Before inoculation, the six patients who later did not develop common cold symptoms had high levels of IL-8 and myeloperoxidase (MPO), and exhibited strong allergen-induced plasma exudation responses (alpha2-macroglobulin). After inoculation, IL-8 and ECP did not increase in these symptomless subjects. In conclusion, high nasal interleukin-8 and myeloperoxidase levels and exudative hyperresponsiveness may protect against infection. The association between nasal interleukin-8 and eosinophil cationic protein in common cold, particularly that observed in nasal lavage fluids after allergen-induced acute exudation of plasma, suggests the involvement of interleukin-8 in exacerbation of airway mucosal eosinophil activity.

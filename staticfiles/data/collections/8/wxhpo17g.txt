The pandemic infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is widely increasing the patients affiliated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from last December of 2019. It's reported that the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to be angiotensin converting enzymes 2 (ACE2). Notably, whether the ACE-related inhibitors or drugs modulated ACE2 activity in affecting with viral activity and disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 is still an open question. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP-4), a well-known anti-diabetic drug, has been widely used to control the glycemic condition in diabetic patients. In this article, we are focusing on the impact of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and DPP4 inhibitors used on SARS-CoV-2 activity and discussions about those drugs that may be related to infectious condition of COVID-19 diseases.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has shown an association with acute myocardial injury, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis. Individuals with myocardial involvement in association with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be at increased risk of developing severe illness. Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. It has been primarily divided into three subsets: genetic, mixed, and acquired cardiomyopathy. We anticipate that, because of the high inflammatory response, other cardiovascular complications may also occur in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. This review explores new information as it pertains to COVID-19 and cardiac complications.

Sera from captive and recently rescued giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in the Wolong Reserve, China, were examined by serum neutralization or hemagglutination inhibition for antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV), canine coronavirus (CCV), canine herpesvirus (CHV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV), and canine parvovirus (CPV). Serum samples from village domestic dogs and cats, which run free throughout the reserve also were examined. Antibodies against CPV were detected in six of eight giant pandas and all dogs and cats tested. The origin of the virus was not determined. Two of eight giant pandas and two of seven dogs had CDV antibody titers. Three of eight pandas and three of seven dogs had CCV antibody titers. Four of eight pandas and two of seven dogs had CAV titers; the titers in dogs were very high. No pandas or dogs had evidence of exposure to CHV or PRV.

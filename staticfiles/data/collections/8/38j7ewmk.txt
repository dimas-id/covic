NMR methods were used to investigate a series of mutants of the pseudoknot within the gene 32 messenger RNA of bacteriophage T2, for the purpose of investigating the range of sequences, stem and loop lengths that can form a similar pseudoknot structure. This information is of particular relevance since the T2 pseudoknot has been considered a representative of a large family of RNA pseudoknots related by a common structural motif, previously referred to as 'common pseudoknot motif 1' or CPK1. In the work presented here, a mutated sequence with the potential to form a pseudoknot with a 6 bp stem2 was shown to adopt a pseudoknot structure similar to that of the wild-type sequence. This result is significant in that it demonstrates that pseudoknots with 6 bp in stem2 and a single nucleotide in loop1 are indeed feasible. Mutated sequences with the potential to form pseudoknots with either 5 or 8 bp in stem2 yielded NMR spectra that could not confirm the formation of a pseudoknot structure. Replacing the adenosine nucleotide in loop1 of the wild-type pseudoknot with any one of G, C or U did not significantly alter the pseudoknot structure. Taken together, the results of this study provide support for the existence of a family of similarly structured pseudoknots with two coaxially stacked stems, either 6 or 7 bp in stem2, and a single nucleotide in loop1. This family includes many of the pseudoknots predicted to occur downstream of the frameshift or readthrough sites in a significant number of viral RNAs.

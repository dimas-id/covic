Background: As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic spreads globally, hospitals are rushing to adapt their facilities which may not have been designed to deal with infections adequately. We present the management of a patient with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. Case: A 66-years-old man presented to the hospital and his recent travel history, infective symptoms and CXR made him a possible COVID-19 suspect. Emergency surgery was decided considering the septic condition. The patient was transported to operating theatre with supplemental oxygen over a face mask and plastic covering over the trolley. Rapid sequence intubation was performed by an experienced anesthetist using a videolaryngoscope. After surgery, the patient remained intubated to avoid re-intubation due to initial presentation of respiratory distress. Droplet, contact and airborne infection precautions were instituted. Conclusions: Our objective was to facilitate surgical management of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 while minimising risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.

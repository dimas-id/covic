Objective Review of the evidence on the psychosocial impact of quarantine measures during serious coronavirus outbreaks before COVID-19. Such information is highly relevant in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Search of the MEDLINE database for relevant studies related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks. Results Across 13 identified studies, quarantine measures were consistently associated with negative psychosocial outcomes, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger, stress, posttraumatic stress, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization. Determinants comprised duration of quarantine measures and income losses. Health care workers constituted a particularly vulnerable group. Conclusion Quarantine measures during serious coronavirus outbreaks have extensive negative consequences for mental health. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions.

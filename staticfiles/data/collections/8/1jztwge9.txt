BACKGROUND AND AIMS: New clinical approaches are needed to minimize complications of gestational diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak with timely screening and proper management. The present study aims to highlight changes in the clinical guideline for gestational diabetes during the pandemic. METHODS: In a narrative review, multiple databases were searched. Furthermore, online searches were conducted to identify guidelines or support documents provided by NGOs, local health authorities, and societies and organizations in the field of diabetes and obstetrics. RESULTS: We included five national guidelines that were published in English from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Australia health agencies. FBG, A1C, RPG were recommended as alternative tests instead of a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) for GDM screening at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Recommendations also included a deferral of postpartum screening till the end of the pandemic, or postponement of testing to 6-12 months after delivery, use telemedicine and telecare. CONCLUSIONS: Updated temporary changes in clinical guidelines are sensible and accommodates social distancing and minimizes risk of exposure to COVID-19. Despite many unsolved controversies in screening, treatment, and follow-up of gestational diabetes, it seems involvement with novel coronavirus have made a reach to a global agreement simpler.

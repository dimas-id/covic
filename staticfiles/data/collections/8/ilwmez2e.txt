Adiponectin is a prime determinant of the status of insulin resistance. Association studies between adiponectin (ADIPOQ) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and metabolic diseases have been reported earlier. However, results are ambiguous due to apparent contradictions. Hence, we investigated (1) the association between ADIPOQ SNPs: −11377C/G, +10211T/G, +45T/G and +276G/T for the risk towards type 2 diabetes (T2D) and, (2) genotype-phenotype association of these SNPs with various biochemical parameters in two cohorts. Genomic DNA of diabetic patients and controls from Gujarat and, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, TaqMan assay and MassArray. Transcript levels of ADIPOQ were assessed in visceral adipose tissue samples, and plasma adiponectin levels were estimated by qPCR and ELISA respectively. Results suggest: (i) reduced HMW adiponectin/total adiponectin ratio in Gujarat patients and its association with +10211T/G and +276G/T, and reduced ADIPOQ transcript levels in T2D, (ii) association of the above SNPs with increased FBG, BMI, TG, TC in Gujarat patients and (iii) increased GGTG haplotype in obese patients of Gujarat population and, (iv) association of −11377C/G with T2D in J&K population. Reduced HMW adiponectin, in the backdrop of obesity and ADIPOQ genetic variants might alter metabolic profile posing risk towards T2D.

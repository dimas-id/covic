Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on the American healthcare system. Personal protective equipment (PPE) remains critical in keeping healthcare providers healthy and safe. The sudden increase in demand as well as the limited availability places increased risk on providers which may inhibit their ability to effectively manage patients. The purpose of this brief article is to review the recommended guidelines for PPE usage and compare them to how medical societies have adapted and responded to decreased supply, as well as public response.

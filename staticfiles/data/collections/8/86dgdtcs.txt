A 2 yr old castrated male Pomeranian was evaluated for a 6 wk history of chronic vomiting, intermittent anorexia, and lethargy. Physical examination revealed a palpable, nonpainful, soft-tissue mass in the midabdominal area. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound revealed a focal, eccentric thickening of the jejunal wall with associated jejunal mural foreign body and partial mechanical obstruction. Following diagnosis of a partial intestinal obstruction as the cause of chronic vomiting, the patient underwent general anesthesia for a laparoscopic-assisted, midjejunal resection and anastomosis using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port. The patient was discharged the day after surgery, and clinical signs abated according to information obtained during a telephone interview conducted 2 and 8 wk postoperatively. The dog described in this report is a unique case of partial intestinal obstruction treated by laparoscopic-assisted resection and anastomosis using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port.

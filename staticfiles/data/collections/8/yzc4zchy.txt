Clinical research findings indicate that there are synergistic interactions between allergy and viral infection that cause increased severity of asthma exacerbations. This article summarizes the current literature linking these 2 risk factors for asthma exacerbation, and reviews experimental data suggesting potential mechanisms for interactions between viral infection and allergy that cause asthma exacerbations. In addition, the authors discuss clinical evidence that treatment of allergic inflammation could help to reduce the frequency and severity of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.

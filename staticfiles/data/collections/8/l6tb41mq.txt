Abstract Aptamer is a kind of synthetic oligonucleotides discriminated by in vitro screening and systematic evolution of exponential enrichment technology (SELEX), which can bind to certain targets (small molecules, proteins, or even entire cells) with extremely high specificity. Owing to the advantages of simple preparation, easy modification and good stability, aptamers have been used to construct biosensors for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms. This paper presents the latest advances in SELEX for screening aptamers for pathogenic microorganisms, demonstrates some reported aptamers for pathogenic microorganisms (protozoa, viruses, bacteria), and reviews aptamer based biosensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms. Finally, the new trends in aptamer based biosensors for detection of pathogenic microorganisms are also discussed.

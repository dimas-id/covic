Abstract As COVID-19 continues to cause immense burden on global healthcare systems, it is crucial to further understand the breadth of this disease process. Recent reports have identified hypercoagulability in a subset of critically ill patients and extremity ischemia in an even smaller cohort. As abnormal coagulation parameters and extremity ischemia have been shown to correlate with poor disease prognosis, understanding how to treat these patients is crucial. In order to better describe the identification and management of this phenomenon, we present two cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who developed fingertip ischemia while in the intensive care unit.

BACKGROUND Although transsternal thymectomy is an effective method in the treatment of juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG) it is traumatic in pediatric patients. Thoracoscopic thymectomy offers an effective and less traumatic approach with respect to cosmesis and postoperative recovery. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 6 consecutive patients treated with thoracoscopic thymectomy was performed. Perioperative parameters and cost analysis were compared with those of 6 consecutive open procedures performed before the study. RESULTS Thoracoscopic thymectomy can be performed in patients as young as 1.6 years. There was no conversion to open procedure and no perioperative morbidity and mortality. The length of operating time and the surgical cost of thoracoscopic procedure were not significantly different from those of open procedure. The length of hospitalization, however, was significantly shorter with thoracoscopic procedure, and hence the overall cost was significantly reduced (P < .05). An intermediate follow-up shows that outcome after thoracoscopic procedure is equally as effective as open procedure. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic thymectomy offers an equally effective but cosmetically more acceptable approach than sternotomy. It has a quicker recovery period and appears to be a less costly alternative to transsternal thymectomy.

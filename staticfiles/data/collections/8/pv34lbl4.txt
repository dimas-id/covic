The aim of this study was to characterize the echocardiographic phenotype of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and its relation to biomarkers. Seventy-four patients (59 Â± 13 years old, 78% male) admitted with COVID-19 were included after referral for transthoracic echocardiography as part of routine care. A level 1 British Society of Echocardiography transthoracic echocardiography was used to assess chamber size and function, valvular disease, and likelihood of pulmonary hypertension. The chief abnormalities were right ventricle (RV) dilatation (41%) and RV dysfunction (27%). RV impairment was associated with increased D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels. In contrast, left ventricular function was hyperdynamic or normal in most (89%) patients.

A Dermatology walk-in clinic available to all hospital staff (HS) was commenced to treat skin problems related to personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An observational case series was conducted in a single district general hospital within Wales (United Kingdom) to record the dermatological diagnoses. Our participant sample comprised of clinical and non-clinical staff working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 areas of the hospital. Over the data collection period (6 weeks), a total of 72 patients attended the clinic of whom 62 were female and 10 were male (mean age = 43yrs). Data comprised of demographic data, current occupation (shown in Table 1), duration of symptoms, past medical history, regular medication and treatment interventions. An analysis of the clinical diagnoses seen are reported in Table 2.

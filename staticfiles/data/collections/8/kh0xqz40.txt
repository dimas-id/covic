Diminishing functional and sensory abilities present unique challenges for nurses when teaching older adults. The bulletin board display is one method that can facilitate learning in older individuals: they can learn at their own pace and develop specific questions for health care professionals. On the basis of developmental theories, knowledge of common physical changes associated with aging, and visual art-based strategies in bulletin board design, nurses can use bulletin boards as an effective educational tool for older adults.

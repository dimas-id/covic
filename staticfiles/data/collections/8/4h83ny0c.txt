Healthy infants and toddlers who attend day care centers are at increased risk for contracting common childhood illnesses such as viral upper and lower respiratory illnesses, viral gastrointestinal infections, and acute and chronic otitis media. The author proposes that this high frequency of common infections be termed daycaritis. Daycaritis imposes significant social and economic burdens on both the family and the health care system. This review describes the most common infections seen in day care attendees, preventative measures to decrease the rates of illness, and a practical approach to diagnosis and management in the emergency department.

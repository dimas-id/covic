Brazil has been recording a frightening exponential curve of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer patients with COVID-19 are likely to have a greater risk of complications and death. A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR method. The mean age was 55.3 years (SD 21.1). The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. By multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (p = 0.027) and with two or more metastatic sites (p <0.001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. This is the first study in a cohort of Brazilian cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high. Our data prompts urgent and effective public policies for this group of especially vulnerable patients.

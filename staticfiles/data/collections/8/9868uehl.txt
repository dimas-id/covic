OBJECTIVE To explore the patterns of temperature changes of patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the effect of glucocorticoid hormone on the temperature of these patients. METHODS The clinical data of 94 SARS cases treated during the outbreak of SARS in South China in 2003 were collected for a retrospective review. According to different treatment regimens, the patients were divided into hormone group (n=35) and non-hormone group (n=59). The control groups consisted of 65 patients with interstitial pneumonia, 78 with bacterial pneumonia and 57 with upper respiratory tract infection. The changes in body temperature were compared between the SARS patients and those with other respiratory diseases and the effect of glucocorticoid hormone on controlling body temperature of the SARS patients was explored. RESULTS The body temperature of patients with the 4 diseases all exhibited obvious reduction 7 days after hospitalization (P<0.001) with only subsequent mild fluctuation within the basically normal range. At each time point of measurement, the body temperature of SARS patients was significantly higher than that of patients with other diseases (P<0.03), with a fluctuation of 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C; and following a pattern of variation similar to those of the other diseases. Of the 4 time points of daily measurement, namely 6, 10, 14 and 18 o'clock, the temperature measured at 14 o'clock was significantly higher than those at the other 3 time points (P<0.001). Hormone therapy did not significantly affect the temperature of SARS patients (P=0.180), who had longer duration of high fever. CONCLUSION SARS patients have higher body temperature and longer duration of high fever. Hormone therapy may not produce significant effect in controlling the temperature of SARS patients.

This study evaluated the significance of lymphocyte subset detection in peripheral blood in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results revealed that CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells were significantly decreased in patients with COVID-19. These patients had a relatively slight decrease in CD4+ T cells but a severe decrease in CD8+ T cells. The significantly elevated CD4/CD8 ratio was observed in COVID-19 patients. T-cell subset counts were related to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19, suggesting that the counts of CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells can be used as diagnostic markers of COVID-19 and predictors of disease severity.

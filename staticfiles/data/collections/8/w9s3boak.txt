BACKGROUND Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taipei has been associated with Taiwanese back from Guangdong, China. We report 4 probable SARS cases with different severity and propose optimal treatment. METHODS Four probable SARS cases were enrolled. Two cases were due to outbreak of SARS in our hospital and two cases were transferred from other hospitals. All patients received standard treatment: ribavirin 1000 mg orally daily for 10 days, Levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 7 days, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 g/kg/day for 2 day after the onset of symptoms. If severe hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 < 200) occurred, protective strategy of mechanical ventilation and methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day were given. The clinical pictures and treatment outcome were discussed. RESULTS Fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, malaise, dizziness and dry cough were initially more common symptoms. Initially chest patterns included focal consolidation, interstitial infiltration or normal. Common laboratory findings were lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. No mortality was found. CONCLUSIONS Highly alert and stringent infection control of SARS cases are required. Otherwise, SARS easily induces hospital-acquired first then community-acquired infection. Initial presentation of radiographic patterns includes normal, interstitial or airspace shadowing. Fever and lymphopenia are occasionally followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise. The standard treatment might be beneficial for decreasing the mortality rate.

Dengue infections are among the most frequent causes of febrile disease in tropical climates. Infections are caused by a flavivirus transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. Aedes aegypti mosquitos are the main transmitters of Dengue viruses. Since these insects are both diurnal and container breeders, particular prevention and control measures are required. Symptom severity varies and can range from a mild, flu-like clinical picture to severe hemorrhage and shock. The most common symptoms experienced by travelers include fever, muscular pain, headaches and skin rash. Depending on the stage of infection, either rapid point-of-care tests or—during the viraemic phase—direct molecular detection of pathogens can be used as diagnostic methods. Serological diagnosis is challenging in terms of interpretation due to serological cross reactions with other flaviviruses.

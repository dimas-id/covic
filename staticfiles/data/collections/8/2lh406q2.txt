The aim of this editorial is to illustrate the new public funding framework of the Italian National Health System following the Covid-19 pandemic. The document reviews the measures put in place by the Italian Government and European Institutions such as the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to deal with this health crisis and subsequent severe economic recession, with particular reference to sources and uses of resources. The use of new budgetary financial spaces in deficit entails greater attention to the assessment of interventions and makes it necessary to keep expenditure under strict control. At the same time, the remodeling of expenditure within its aggregates, public investment in innovation, and the removal of administrative obstacles can strengthen the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the extraordinary needs deriving from the spread of Covid-19 and its resilience to future health shocks.

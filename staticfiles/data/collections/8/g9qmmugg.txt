Abstract The hemagglutinin of influenza virus A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7) was altered at its multibasic cleavage site by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for proteolytic activation after expression in CV-1 cells. The results indicated that the cellular protease responsible for activation recognizes the tetrapeptide motif R-X-K/R-R that must be presented in the correct sequence position. Studies on plaque variants of influenza virus A/fowINictoria/75 (H7N7) showed that alteration of the consensus sequence resulted in a loss of pathogenicity for chickens.

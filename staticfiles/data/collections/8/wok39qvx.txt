Calcium is one of the most prominent second messengers in eukaryotic cells. The involvement of calcium signaling in bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) replication was not yet reported. In this study, we revealed that the L-type Ca2+ calcium channel blocker, Verapamil and store-operated calcium channel blocker, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) inhibited BoHV-1 replication in MDBK cells at the post-entry stages, and the Na+/Ca²+ exchanger inhibitor, N-arachidonoyl glycine exchanger (NAGly) interfered with the viral entry process. NAGly also effected the phosphorylation of PLCγ-1 at Ser1248, which corroborated our previous findings, that PLCγ-1 is important for BoHV-1 entry. Collectively, these results suggest that diverse calcium channels are employed by BoHV-1 for efficient replication.

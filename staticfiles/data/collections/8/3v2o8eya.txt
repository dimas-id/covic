INTRODUCTION During laparoscopic low anterior resection with double stapling technique reconstruction, it is necessary to securely implement rectal transection and anastomosis to prevent anastomotic leakage (AL). However, risk factors and preventive measures for AL are not known sufficiently. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate risk factors associated with AL and to clarify strategies to prevent it. METHODS We analyzed a total of 296 cases with rectal cancer who had undergone laparoscopic low anterior resection with double stapling technique reconstruction at the National Cancer Center Hospital East. The relationship between AL and patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were retrospectively investigated. RESULTS There were 186 male and 110 female patients with a median age of 62. Overall, AL occurred in 24 cases (8.1%). Being a man, having an anal verge distance ≤7 cm, and undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy were associated with an elevated risk for AL (P = 0.0005, 0.0034, and 0.0222, respectively). Neither an anal drainage tube nor diverting stoma creation correlated with incidence of AL. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being a man (odds ratio = 18.0; 95% confidence interval: 2.4-138) and having an anal verge distance ≤7 cm (odds ratio = 3.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-9.4) were significant risk factors. These two factors were present in 61 cases, including 14 who developed AL (23.0%). In this high-risk group, diverting stoma creation significantly reduced the occurrence of AL (P = 0.0363), but an anal drainage tube had no effect on incidence of AL (P = 0.3399). CONCLUSION We identified the high-risk population for AL after laparoscopic low anterior resection with double stapling technique reconstruction based on two factors. This will enable surgeons to appropriately recommend diverting stoma creation.

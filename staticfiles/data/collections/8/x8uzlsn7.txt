Abstract Dieldrin (36 mg/kg body weight) administered intraperitoneally prolonged recovery from infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) in the genetically-resistant A/J strain, affected the humoral anti-MHV3 IgG immune response, and inhibited the intrinsic antiviral activity of peritoneal macrophages upon in vitro rechallenge with the virus. Infection of untreated A/J animals and vehicle controls with MHV3 resulted in marked and reproducible activation of peritoneal macrophages, observed in vitro as resistance to MHV3-cytopathic effects 48 hr after rechallenge with the virus, whereas exposure to dieldrin resulted in apparent loss of the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict replication of MHV3 and to protect them from cytolysis. In addition, in vitro treatment of MHV3 virus-activated macrophages with dieldrin, mitomycin C and X-irradiation, inhibited the intrinsic capacity of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. This mechanism of cellular restriction of the virus by MHV3-activated macrophages from the resistant A/J strain appeared to be one of the sensitive targets for the suppressive action of dieldrin on host resistance, as (i) no major changes in macrophage cellular parameters were observed in in vitro studies of cell viability, adherence to plastic, and Superoxide anion generation; (ii) the increased cell yield in the peritoneal exudates during MHV3 virus infection was not affected by dieldrin exposure; and (iii) the attachment and uptake of [3H]MHV3 by virus-activated macophages was shown to be unchanged by dieldrin exposure.

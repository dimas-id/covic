BACKGROUND Primary repair of large hiatal hernia is associated with a high recurrence rate. The use of mesh may reduce this recurrence rate. The indication for mesh use, the type of mesh to use, and the placement technique are controversial. A survey of surgeon practice was undertaken to obtain a better understanding of the controversies surrounding this clinical problem. METHODS A questionnaire on the technique and results of mesh hiatal herniorrhaphy was sent to 1,192 members of the Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). RESULTS There were 275 responses; 261 of these were analyzed. A total of 5,486 hiatal hernia repairs with mesh were reported; 77% and 23% were performed laparoscopically vs open, respectively. The most common indication for mesh usage was an increased size hiatal defect (46% of respondents). The most common mesh types were biomaterial (28%), polytetrafluoroethylene (25%), and polypropylene (21%). Suture anchorage was the most common fixation technique (56% of respondents). The findings showed a failure rate of 3%, a stricture rate of 0.2%, and an erosion rate of 0.3%. Biomaterial tended to be associated with failure, whereas nonabsorbable mesh tended to be associated with stricture and erosion. CONCLUSIONS The use of mesh during hiatal hernia repair resulted in a reported recurrence rate which appeared to be lower than that obtained historically without mesh. No one mesh type was clearly superior in terms of avoiding failure and complication.

I thank Lindahl and Li for their thoughtful comments on the non‐anticoagulant properties of heparin.(1) Heightened awareness of hypercoagulability has made heparin part and parcel of the COVID‐19 management algorithms. In addition, reports of prophylactic anticoagulation failure have triggered several trials where escalated doses of heparin are compared with standard doses with the aim of preventing thrombotic complications. At this juncture, we do need to consider where do the non‐anticoagulant properties of heparin fit in the COVID‐19 clinical context?

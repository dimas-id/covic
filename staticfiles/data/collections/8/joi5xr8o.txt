The surgeon needs to have an inexpensive, available, non-toxic, and practical disinfectant that is effective in sanitizing against the CoVID-19 virus. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence for using hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the office setting on a daily basis. The methods used to assemble recommendations were to review the literature including evidence for this solution when used in different locations and industries other than the oral-maxillofacial clinic facility. The results indicate that this material can be used with a high predictability for disinfecting against the CoVID-19 virus.

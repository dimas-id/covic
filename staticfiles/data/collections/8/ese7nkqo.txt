We present the first patient of a 51-year-old man with fever, dyspnea and deterioration of his chronic coughs, who was referred to the Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (MKS). Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed increased diameter of his trachea (39 mm), right (30 mm) and left (26 mm) main bronchi, because of MKS. Then, COIVD-19 infection was eventually confirmed by RT-PCR. To our knowledge, COIVD-19 has not been reported in patients with the MKS.

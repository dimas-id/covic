PURPOSE The aim of this study was to compare changes in respiratory dynamics starting immediately after administration of propofol alone or a combination of propofol and midazolam. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-seven healthy adult volunteers participated in a randomized crossover study of undergoing sedation with propofol alone (P group) or with a combination of propofol and midazolam (PM group). In the P group, continuous infusion of propofol through a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump was started with the target effect site (ES) concentration set at 1.2 μg/mL. In the PM group, participants received a bolus administration of midazolam 0.02 mg/kg simultaneously with the start of continuous infusion of propofol through a TCI pump with the target ES concentration set at 0.8 μg/mL. The variables measured included the bispectral index (BIS) value, tidal volume (VT), percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (ETCO2), estimated ES propofol concentration, and minute volume. RESULTS BIS value, VT, SpO2, and ETCO2 decreased after sedative administration in the 2 groups. RR increased in the 2 groups. These changes occurred sooner in the PM group than in the P group. The ratio of change in VT to change in BIS value decreased in the 2 groups and was markedly smaller in the PM group than in the P group. Ratios of changes in SpO2, RR, and ETCO2 to change in BIS value increased in the 2 groups and were larger in the PM group than in the P group. CONCLUSION Changes in respiratory dynamics occurred sooner in the PM group than in the P group. In the PM group, although VT began to decrease before the change in BIS value, the increase in RR caused the rate of decrease in SpO2 to be smaller than the rate of decrease in BIS value.

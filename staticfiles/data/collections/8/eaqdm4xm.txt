We would like to thank Selck et al. for their letter. The issue they raise has both methodological and scientific interest. We clearly acknowledge in our discussion the limitations of our approach to estimate the causal impact of cold weather on alcoholic cirrhosis at a population level. In addition, as highlighted in the accompanying editorial, these associations at a population level might not hold at an individual level, and the causes of differences in alcohol intake between populations and individuals might not be the same.

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 disease were identified in a cohort study involving 1099 patients from China. COVID-19 most commonly present with fever, cough, fatigue, and congestion. Two out of 1099 patients were reported to have skin rash, but time of onset and clinical description of rash were missing (Reference B). Another study focused primarily on cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 evaluated 88 patients from Italy. 18 out of the 88 patients developed cutaneous manifestations, but only 8 patients developed skin lesions at onset of disease.

Abstract The Luminex® NxTAG® Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG RPP) is an IVD-cleared assay for the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids from 18 respiratory viruses and 2 (or 3 outside of the U.S.) atypical bacterial pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs. Its scalability allows concurrent testing of up to 96 samples in a single batch. Nucleic acid extracted from 200 µL of raw specimen using the easyMAG® extractor is added directly to pre-plated, lyophilized bead reagents (LBRs), where multiplexed RT-PCR and hybridization to MagPlex-TAG™ microspheres occurs within a sealed reaction well using a single cycling program. Data acquisition is done on the MAGPIX® instrument which reads and sorts the reaction products directly from the sealed well following transfer of the assay plate from the thermal cycler. NxTAG is the newest innovation in bead-based nucleic acid chemistry developed by Luminex. Here we provide the detailed assay protocol and present data which describe the clinical and analytical performance characteristics of NxTAG RPP.

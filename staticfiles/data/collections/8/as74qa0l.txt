Public information search data from sources such as Google Trends affords researchers a perspective on what society does not know, or what society wants to find out prompted by, or in response to, developments in societal communication and news media events. In times of crisis, online public information search thus offers a window into the most urgent concerns of, and demands by society. By extension, such data offers a window into upcoming, and currently pressing demands on businesses, policymakers and researchers. This research note aims to illustrate some of these themes with a visual-based overview of the current COVID-19 / Coronavirus crisis.

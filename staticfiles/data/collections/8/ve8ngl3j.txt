BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019, also known as COVID-19, has been declared a global pandemic. Significant controversies exist regarding treatment modalities for this novel disease, especially in immunocompromised patients. Experience with management of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients is scarce; effects of this virus on immunosuppressed individuals are not well understood. METHODS: We identified 30 renal transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to inpatient between March 2020 and April 2020. All patients received a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; half of the patients received methylprednisolone. During hospitalization, calcineurin inhibitors and antimetabolites were held; prednisone was continued. RESULTS: Clinical presentation of flu-like symptoms was similar to those in the general population. Hyponatremia, lymphopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated inflammatory markers were common. Over the course of follow-up, 23 have been discharged home with a functioning allograft and in stable condition; 4 experienced acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy; 7 patients were intubated, and 6 expired. The mortality rate in our cohort was 20%. CONCLUSION: Our findings described the characteristics and outcomes of this highly fatal illness in a multi-ethnic kidney transplant cohort, with insights on immunosuppression management that could further our understanding of this unique disease in immunocompromised populations.

The avalanche of genomic data generated from the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires the development of tools to detect and monitor its mutations across the World. Here, we present a webtool, coronapp, dedicated to easily processing user-provided SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, in order to detect and annotate protein-changing mutations. This results in an up-to-date status of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, both worldwide and in user-selected countries. The tool allows users to highlight and prioritize the most frequent mutations in specific protein regions, and to monitor their frequency in the population over time. The tool is available at http://giorgilab.dyndns.org/coronapp/ and the full code is freely shared at https://github.com/federicogiorgi/giorgilab/tree/master/coronapp

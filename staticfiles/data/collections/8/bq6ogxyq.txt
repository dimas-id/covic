COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a huge concern to the global population due to its highly contagious properties. The SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant in the coronavirus family. The world is focussing on several methods to battle against this novel corona virus, including control of its spread. In this context, ARCI has quickly made efforts to develop disinfection systems including a UVC-based disinfection trolley, honeycomb air heater and a fogging chamber using UVC germicidal lamps, dry heat sterilization and HOCl-based chemical disinfectant to provide rapid and effective inactivation of microorganisms causing the pandemic. These systems have been successfully deployed at different hospitals for their validation.

Autoimmune encephalitis is a rapid, progressive encephalopathy due to an autoimmune response directed against the brain parenchyma. It is associated with significant morbidity, often necessitating evaluation and treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patient management centers on rapid diagnosis of the autoimmune encephalitis syndrome with careful assessment for other etiologies of acute encephalopathy, the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, and the management of associated sequelae including status epilepticus, respiratory failure, elevated intracranial pressure, and dysautonomia.

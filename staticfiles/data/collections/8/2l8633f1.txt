BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has inevitable consequences for medical care of non-COVID-19 patients. To assess the impact of this pandemic on oncological care, a nationwide survey was conducted among cancer patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: The patients’ perspective on oncological care was investigated using an online survey between March 29(th) 2020 and April 18(th) 2020. The survey consisted of 20 questions on four topics: patients’ characteristics, contact with the hospital, consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and concerns about COVID-19. RESULTS: 5302 cancer patients completed this nationwide survey. Overall, 30% of patients reported consequences for their oncological treatment or follow-up. In the majority of cases this resulted in conversion from hospital visit to consultation by phone or video. The most frequently adjusted treatments were chemotherapy (30%) and immunotherapy (32%). Among patients with delay and discontinuation of treatment, respectively 55% and 63% of patients were (very) concerned about these consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequences were independent of regional differences in COVID-19 incidence. However, patients in regions with high COVID-19 incidence were significantly more concerned. CONCLUSION: This is the first study investigating perspectives of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrates the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on oncological care, indicating the need for psycho-oncological support during this pandemic.

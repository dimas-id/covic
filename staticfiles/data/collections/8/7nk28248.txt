PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW Due to their different virulence and infectivity, both severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 09 revealed different strengths and weaknesses in our ability to contain new viral threats over the past decade. This review focuses on recent literature around attempts to contain the impact of these two viral epidemics that have refined our approach for the future. RECENT FINDINGS Attempts to contain emerging epidemics at the site of origin have so far failed, in part due to resourcing of surveillance. H1N1 09 revealed major problems with rigid pandemic planning and the need for much greater flexibility. Popular attempts to prevent international spread of pandemics have minimal efficacy. Availability of rapid diagnostic tests is critical to optimally managing epidemics and was a major problem with H1N1 09. Healthcare institutions have emerged as a major source of infection. SUMMARY The experience with H1N1 09 and SARS has been very useful in informing us of the strengths and weaknesses of our current approach to emerging epidemics. Key messages are a need for improved surveillance, more flexible planning, improved diagnostic testing and retaining a focus on basic hygiene measures.

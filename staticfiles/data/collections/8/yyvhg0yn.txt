As there are no validated and rapid diagnostic tests nor specific treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the initial stage of the outbreak, public health measures are vital for the control of the disease. These included an enhanced disease surveillance system, expanded laboratory diagnostic capacity, heightened infection control in hospitals and residential institutions for the elderly, intensive contact tracing coupled with medical surveillance at designated medical centres, quarantine of close contacts by way of home confinement, formation of multidisciplinary investigation and response teams, and public education and communication. The above measures were implemented in many countries during the outbreak. To prevent spread in the region and beyond, port health measures targeted at both entry and exit health screenings were also carried out together with regional and international liaison.

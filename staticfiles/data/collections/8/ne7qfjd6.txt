The COVID-19 pandemic has kicked off a global race to launch clinical trials of experimental vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus. Worldwide, as resources are directed toward accelerating the research into unravelling the mechanism of COVID-19 pathophysiology, concerns have been raised regarding the future of clinical research in United Kingdom and elsewhere during the current pandemic. However, the real immediate impact of these restrictions due to lock-down is most acutely felt by scientists working on non-COVID-19 biomedical research bench and clinical researchers whose drug trials have to be delayed, suspended or ceased. Here, we highlight our views from "ground zero" as we represent those whose work are deeply affected by the restrictions. We draw attention to some of the practical realities and emotions experienced in the laboratory. In addition, we also highlight the difficulties for policy makers to maintain equanimity in prioritizing their decisions cross the different fields of science.

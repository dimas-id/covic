Objective: We aimed to detect the malignant arrhythmic potential of COVID-19 with surface electrocardiographic (ECG) markers.Material and method: Of the ECG parameters PR, QT, QTc, QTd, TPe, and Tpe/QTc were measured in 51 COVID-19 patients and 40 in control subjects.Results: Compared to control group mean QTc (410.8 ± 24.3 msec vs. 394.6 ± 20.3 msec, p < .001) and Tpe/QTc (0.19 ± 0.02 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04, p = .036) and median QTd (47.52 vs. 46.5) values were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients. Troponin levels were significantly correlated with heart rate (r = 0.387, p = .006) but not with ECG parameters.Conclusion: Several ventricular arrhythmia surface ECG predictors including QTc, QTd, and Tpe/QTc are increased in COVID-19 patients. Since medications used in COVID-19 patients have the potential to affect these parameters, giving importance to these ECG markers may have a significant contribution in decreasing disease-related arrhythmias.

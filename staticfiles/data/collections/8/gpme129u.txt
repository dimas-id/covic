N-type inactivation of voltage-gated K+ channels is conferred by the N-terminal "ball" domains of select pore-forming &#945; subunits or of auxiliary ß subunits, and influences electrical cellular excitability. Here, we show that hemin impairs inactivation of K+ channels formed by Kv3.4 &#945; subunits as well as that induced by the subunits Kvß1.1, Kvß1.2, and Kvß3.1 when coexpressed with &#945; subunits of the Kv1 subfamily. In Kvß1.1, hemin interacts with cysteine and histidine residues in the N terminus (C7 and H10) with high affinity (EC50 100 nM). Similarly, rapid inactivation of Kv4.2 channels induced by the dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein DPP6a is also sensitive to hemin, and the DPP6a mutation C13S eliminates this dependence. The results suggest a common mechanism for a dynamic regulation of Kv channel inactivation by heme/hemin in N-terminal ball domains of Kv &#945; and auxiliary ß subunits. Free intracellular heme therefore has the potential to regulate cellular excitability via modulation of Kv channel inactivation.

A reduced peripheral blood absolute lymphocyte count with an elevated neutrophil count has been a consistent observation in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. In this brief meta‐analysis, the reduction of lymphocyte subset counts in COVID‐19 patients was investigated across 20 peer‐reviewed studies meeting criteria for reporting lymphocyte subset counts and COVID‐19 disease severity. CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, B cell, NK cell and total lymphocyte cell counts all showed statistically significant reduction in patients with severe/critical COVID‐19 disease compared to mild/moderate disease. T cell subsets showed the largest standardized magnitude of change. In some studies, multivariate analysis has shown that CD4 and/or CD8 T cells counts are independently predictive of patient outcomes.

This video's objective was to describe our spiral technique and surgical steps of robotic-assisted laparoscopic apical suspension (RALAS) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic apical vaginal prolapse. A 70-year-old Caucasian woman, gravida 3, para 2 had symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse (POP) apical/anterior stage III. At pelvic ultrasound evaluation, the uterus was small and normal appearing of adnexa bilaterally. She failed pessaries and is sexually active. The most relevant complaints were vaginal bulging and pressure. She denied urinary incontinence. During the surgery, we used (1) 3-0, V-Loc™ (Covidien) and we reinforced these absorbable sutures with (2) 2-0, GORE-TEX® Suture (Gore Medical). The Si da Vinci Surgical System was used with 4 arms and 5 trocars configuration, docked on the patient's left side. On the right/left apical support, we used V-Loc and Gore-Tex and these provided the initial 2 points suspension on the uterosacral ligaments (USL). We like to attach the left to the right USL. We then developed the space between the bladder and vagina and proceed with a plication of the pubocervical fascia with V-loc sutures. Two anterior apical support sutures were taken from the vagina to the transversalis fascia on the anterior abdominal wall and then hid behind the bladder peritoneum. The tension of these sutures was maintained with Hem-o-lock (TeleFlex) and LAPRA-TY (Ethicon). With the spiral technique, we secured these sutures through aponeurosis of abdominal muscle inside-outside-inside using a Carter-Thomason (Cooper Surgical) laparoscopic port closure system. This technique may provide a better long-term support for the anterior apical compartment.

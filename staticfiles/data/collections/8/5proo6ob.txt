Abstract In this paper, by considering pathogen evolution and human interventions behaviors with vaccines or drugs, we build up a novel SEIRW model with the vaccination to the newborn children. The stability of the SEIRW model with time-varying perturbation to predict the evolution tendency of the disease is analyzed. Furthermore, we introduce a time-varying delay into the susceptible and infective stages in the model and give some global exponential stability criteria for the time-varying delay system. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the results.

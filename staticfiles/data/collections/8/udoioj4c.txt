In this paper, the two-step high-risk immunization was investigated based on high-risk immunization for the SIRS model in small-world networks and scale-free networks. First, the effects of various immunization schemes are studied and compared. When the number of immune is same, the research result shows that the immune effect of the two-step high-risk immunization strategy is not the best nor the worst. However, the practicability is better compare with others. Furthermore, by changing the proportional of immunization the optimal immune effect can be achieved in the two-step high-risk immunization. Computation results verify that the two-step high-risk immunization is effective, and it is economic and feasible in practice.

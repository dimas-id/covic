Risk perception assessment of COVID-19 among Portuguese Healthcare Professionals (HCP) and General Population (GPop) was evaluated in a snowball 3 403 individual’s sample. 54.9% of HCP believed there is a high probability of becoming infected, in contrast with 24.0% of GPop (p <0.001) and, in more than 1/4, that this could happen to their family. Regarding prophylactic isolation, more than 70% agreed with its effectiveness. A large proportion perceived that health services are poorly prepared (50.1% GPop versus 63.5% HCP, p<0.001). Regarding Health Authorities’ communication, about 60% were “moderately” satisfied. 46.7% GPop and 52.8% HCP had the opinion the pandemic could be controlled in three to six months (p=0.01).

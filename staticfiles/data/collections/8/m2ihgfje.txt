OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of single-port retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (SPRA) in dogs. STUDY DESIGN A pilot experimental study. ANIMALS Eight healthy beagle dogs. METHODS SPRA was performed on the left and right sides (4 dogs each). Resection of the adrenal gland was performed through a SILS port using a retroperitoneal approach. Operative time was defined from skin incision to the completion of skin suture. Postoperative pain was evaluated by using 3 pain scores. Integrity of the adrenal gland capsule was evaluated by histologic assessment. RESULTS Mean time taken to complete the SPRA was 44.1 minutes (range, 37-51) and was significantly longer on the right side than on the left side (P < .05). There were no complications intraoperatively or during 14 days of postoperative monitoring. The adrenal gland capsule was found to be injured in 3 of the 8 dogs by histologic assessment. CONCLUSION This is the first report of SPRA in the veterinary literature. With this technique it is possible to perform adrenalectomy with some risk of capsule penetration and with excellent visibility. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study suggests that SPRA is feasible and can be used to resect small adrenal tumors with minimal complications.

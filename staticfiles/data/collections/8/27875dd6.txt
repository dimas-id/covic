Western immunoblots, the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (KELA), and the microagglutination test were used to evaluate cross-reactivity among antibodies to serovars of Leptospira interrogans (leptospiral serovars), and B. burgdorferi from naturally infected dogs, and to Serpulina (Treponema) hyodysenteriae from vaccinated rabbits. Whole-cell lysates from Borrelia spp., leptospiral serovars, and Serpulina spp. were used for SDS-PAGE, western blots, and KELA. Cross-reactivity occurred between the antibodies to B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars when tested on the heterologous antigens. Antibodies to leptospiral serovars tended to cross-react more strongly with antigens of B. burgdorferi spp. than did antibodies to B. burgdorferi when tested against antigens of leptospiral serovars. The antibodies against B. burgdorferi showed a lesser degree of cross-reactivity to the antigens of S. hyodysenteriae and S. innocens than they did to leptospiral serovars. We conclude that cross-reactivity occurs between B. burgdorferi and leptospiral serovars. Validation and interpretation of ELISA tests for detection of antibody activity to whole cell lysates of the Lyme agent must take this cross-reactivity into consideration. Conversely, dogs infected with the Lyme agent do not show significant cross-reactivity in the microagglutination test for antibody to the leptospiral serovars.

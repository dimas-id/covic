In this manuscript, system modeling and identification techniques are applied in developing a prognostic yet deterministic model to forecast the spread of COVID-19 in India. The model is verified with the historical data and a forecast of 30-days ahead is presented for the 10 most affected states of India. The major results suggest that our model can very well capture the disease variations with high accuracy. Results also show a steep rise in the total cumulative cases and deaths in the coming weeks.

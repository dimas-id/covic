Background: 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed significant threats to public health To identify and treat the severe and critical patients with COVID-19 is the key clinical problem to be solved The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 Methods: We searched independently studies and retrieved the data that involved the clinical characteristics of severe and non-severe patients with COVID-19 through database searching Two authors independently retrieved the data from the individual studies, assessed the study quality with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and analyzed publication bias by Begg's test We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of groups using fixed or random-effect models Results: Five studies with 5,328 patients confirmed with COVID-19 met the inclusion criteria Severe patents were older and more common in dyspnea, vomiting or diarrhea, creatinine &gt;104 micromol/L, procalcitonin &gt;/=0 05 ng/mL, lymphocyte count &lt;1 5x10(9)/L and bilateral involvement of chest CT Severe patents had higher risk on complications including acute cardiac injury (OR 13 48;95% CI, 3 60 to 50 47, P&lt;0 001) or acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 11 55;95% CI, 3 44 to 38 77, P&lt;0 001), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 26 12;95% CI, 11 14 to 61 25, P&lt;0 001), shock (OR 53 17;95% CI, 12 54 to 225 4, P&lt;0 001) and in-hospital death (OR 45 24;95% CI, 19 43 to 105 35, P&lt;0 001) Severe group required more main interventions such as received antiviral therapy (OR 1 69;95% CI, 1 23 to 2 32, P=0 001), corticosteroids (OR 5 07;95% CI, 3 69 to 6 98, P&lt;0 001), CRRT (OR 37 95;95% CI, 7 26 to 198 41, P&lt;0 001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 129 35;95% CI, 25 83 to 647 68, P&lt;0 001) Conclusions: Severe patients with COVID-19 had more risk of clinical characteristics and multiple system organ complications Even received more main interventions, severe patients had higher risk of mortality

Rousettus leschenaulti is an abundant species in many countries of South‐East Asia, including south China. We isolated seven microsatellite loci in R. leschenaulti from genomic DNA enriched for CA repeats with the enriched library method. A total of 56 samples from a population in the Guangxi Province of China were tested with these microsatellite markers. The polymorphism ranged from seven to 16 alleles, and the observed heterozygosity was 84–94%. It is the first time microsatellite markers were characterized from R. leschenaulti, and these markers can be an important tool for analysing population structure and genotypic diversity.

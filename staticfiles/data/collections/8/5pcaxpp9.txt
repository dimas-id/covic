The current pandemic coronavirus labelled as Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS -CoV-2) is a significant public health threat over for past few weeks. Overall case fatality rates range between 2-6%; however, the rates are higher in patients with severe disease, advanced age and underlying comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Recent reports showed about 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had underlying chronic liver disease. Experience from previous SARS epidemic suggest that 60% of patients developed various degrees of liver damage. In the current pandemic, hepatic dysfunction was seen in 14-53% of patients with COVID-19, particularly in those with severe disease. Cases of acute liver injury have been reported, associated with higher mortality. Hepatic involvement in COVID-19 could be multifactorial related to any of direct cytopathic effect of the virus, uncontrolled immune reaction, sepsis or drug induced liver injury. The postulated mechanism of viral entry is through the host ACE2 receptors that are abundantly present in type 2 alveolar cells. Interestingly, the expression of ACE2 receptors were identified in the gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium and cholangiocytes of the liver. Liver transplant recipients with COVID-19 have been reported recently. Effects of COVID-19 on underlying chronic liver disease requires a detailed evaluation and currently data is lacking and further research is warranted in this area. With lack of definitive therapy, patient education, hand hygiene and social distancing appears to be the cornerstone in minimising the disease spread.

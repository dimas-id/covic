INTRODUCTION Adult diaphragmatic hernia is a rare case and usually present with various clinical manifestations. Surgery can be done by thoracic and abdominal approaches. In emergency cases, mostly performed by abdominal approach. The use of mesh to close the defect is currently emerging as a viable option. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a case of 70-year-old woman with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of laparoscopic surgery with the installation of an anti-adhesive mesh for diaphragmatic hernia seven months before admission. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan found recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The patient then received laparotomy showing diaphragmatic hernia with contents in the form of transverse colon, ileum, gastric and omentum. The self-attached mesh was placed on the supra-diaphragm with abdominal approach. The patient was hospitalised four days after surgery. At two weeks and six months follow-up, no complaints were found. CT scan and chest X-ray were within normal limits. DISCUSSION We did a modified technique in managing the recurrence and adhesion of the diaphragmatic hernia using the hernia mesh attached onto the superior side of the diaphragm to minimise the complications and recurrences. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal supradiaphragmatic self-attached mesh for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia can be considered to be an alternative treatment for recurrent diaphragmatic hernia in an emergency setting because this procedure is relatively easier, safer, causes fewer postoperative complications, and can prevent recurrence.

Intensive care units (ICUs) are treating hospital’s poorest patients that need medical assistance during the most extreme period of their life. Intensive patients are treated with extensive invasive procedures, which may cause a risk of hospital infections in 10–30% of the cases. More than half of these infections can be prevented. The patients are often admitted directly from outside the hospital or from abroad with trauma after accidents, serious heart and lung conditions, sepsis and other life-threatening diseases. Infection or carrier state of microbes is often unknown on arrival and poses a risk of transmission to other patients, personnel and the environment. Patients that are transferred between different healthcare levels and institutions with unknown infection may be a particular risk for other patients. In spite of the serious state of the patients, many ICUs have few resources and are overcrowded and understaffed, with a lack of competent personnel. ICU should have a large enough area and be designed, furnished and staffed for a good, safe and effective infection control. The following chapter is focused on practical measures to reduce the incidence of infections among ICU patients.

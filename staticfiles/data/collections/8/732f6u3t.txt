During the coronavirus outbreak in China, our center performed 16 organ transplants (10 kidney, 4 liver and 2 lung transplants, from January 24 to March 11, 2020) harvested from deceased donors. Regarding the strategies to prevent infections of COVID‐19, we implemented specific measures for the donor and recipient management, as well as prevention of hospital‐acquired infections. All 16 organ recipients had a favorable outcome without COVID‐19 infection. Our approaches aiming to interrupt the spread of coronavirus within the transplantation wards were successful and allowed us to maintain the transplantation program for deceased liver, kidney and lung recipients.

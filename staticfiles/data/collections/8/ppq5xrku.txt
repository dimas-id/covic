BACKGROUND The main requirements when performing laparoscopic local resection for early mucosal tumors of the stomach are a clearly defined cancer-free margin and precise tumor localization. In this study, a novel method for precise intraoperative tumor localization and appropriate resection in a porcine model is introduced: endoscopic submucosal cutting and light transmission (ESCLT). METHODS A total of 15 cases of laparoscopic local resection were performed in 6 pigs. The size of the target lesions was approximately 20 mm. The imaginary lesions were located in the high body anterior wall, posterior wall, lower body posterior wall, angle, and antrum anterior wall of the stomach. Mucosal marking around the lesions, mucosal precutting surrounding the marking, and submucosal cutting along the precutting line using white light endoscopy were sequentially performed. Next, an endoscopic light source was placed directly in front of the lesion. Exact oval-shaped submucosal cutting margins were identified via laparoscopy. Laparoscopic local resection was performed after the minimal distance from the stapler line to the submucosal cutting line was confirmed. The sizes of the mucosal marking, submucosal cutting line, and the entire resected mucosa and serosa were measured. RESULTS The procedure was completed successfully in all pigs. Local resection was completed on all of the lesions. The mean endoscopic and laparoscopic procedure times were 26.1 and 12.7 min, respectively. The mean size of the resected specimens was: (i) marking lesion, 22 × 19.5 mm; (ii) submucosal cutting line, 26.7 × 23.2 mm; (iii) entire resected mucosa, 37 × 31 mm; and (iv) entire resected serosa, 41.7 × 33.1 mm. There was no intraoperative morbidity. CONCLUSION ESCLT provides a precise and useful method of intraoperative tumor localization during laparoscopic local resection of the stomach in terms of minimizing the resection of normal stomach tissue and guaranteeing adequate mucosal safety margins.

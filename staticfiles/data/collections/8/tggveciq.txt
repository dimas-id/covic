Nineteen years ago, I could not have imagined that I would end up founding Australia’s first youth-focused HIV/AIDS prevention organization. Nineteen years ago, when I was 8 years old, my connection with HIV/AIDS began; my Mom, divorced and raising me as a single parent, was diagnosed HIV-positive (herein HIV+). It was the mid-1980s and the Australian social climate surrounding AIDS was one laden with fear. During that time, Australia’s profound early response to what would become the worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic was taking form.

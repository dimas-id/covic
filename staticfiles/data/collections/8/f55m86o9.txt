Our aim was to establish the safety and efficacy of barbed suture for enterotomy closure after laparoscopic right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis. This study included 47 patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal mechanical anastomosis and barbed suture enterotomy closure (barbed suture closure-BSC) for adenocarcinoma (with the exception of T4 lesions and metastasis), compared with 47 matched patients who underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal mechanical anastomosis and conventional suture enterotomy closure (conventional suture closure-CSC) during the same period. Controls were matched for stage, age, and gender via a statistically generated selection of all laparoscopic right hemicolectomies performed from January 2009 until December 2015. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of age, sex, BMI, ASA, co-morbidity, previous abdominal surgery, cancer site and cancer staging. In terms of operating time (median 120 min for BSC and 127.5 min for CSC), histopathological results, surgical site complications (2.1% for BSC and 8.5% for CSC), hospitalization (median 6 days for BSC and 5 days for CSC), readmission rate (0%), there were no differences between the groups (p > 0.05). No significant differences were noted between the two groups in terms of the postoperative course. Our results support that the use of knotless barbed sutures for enterotomy closure after laparoscopic right colectomy with intracorporeal mechanical anastomosis is safe and reproducible.

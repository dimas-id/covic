In the search to rapidly identify effective therapies that will mitigate the morbidity and mortality of COVID‐19, attention has been directed towards the repurposing of existing drugs. Candidates for repurposing include drugs that target COVID‐19 pathobiology, including agents that alter angiotensin signaling. Recent data indicate that key findings in COVID‐19 patients include thrombosis and endothelitis. Activation of PAR1 (Proteinase‐activated receptor 1), in particular by the serine protease thrombin, is a critical element in platelet aggregation and coagulation. PAR1 activation also impacts on the actions of other cell types involved in COVID‐19 pathobiology, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. Vorapaxar is an approved inhibitor of PAR1, used for treatment of patients with myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease. Here, we discuss evidence implying a possible beneficial role for vorapaxar in the treatment of COVID‐19 patients and in addition, other as‐yet non‐approved antagonists of PAR1 and PAR4.

PURPOSE Delay in receiving treatment in psychosis may lead to adverse consequences. We examined the predictors for help-seeking duration in adult-onset psychosis Chinese patients in Hong Kong. We hypothesized that factors which are more related to the illness manifestation would be predictive of waiting time before any help-seeking initiation, and factors which are more related to one's knowledge about mental health services would be predictive of help-seeking duration. METHODS First-episode patients with psychosis were recruited from the Jockey Club Early Psychosis project. They were asked to report retrospectively all help-seeking behaviors involved since their first occurrence of psychotic symptoms until receipt of effective psychiatric treatment. Baseline characteristics, pre-morbid functioning and traits, and mode of illness onset were assessed. RESULTS Help-seeking pattern was analyzed in 360 patients who had subsequently reached the psychiatric services. They had an average of 2.5 help-seeking contacts. Nearly half of the first help-seeking process was initiated by family members. Only 1 % approached priests or traditional healers as the first step in help-seeking. Whereas a gradual mode of onset was significantly associated with longer waiting time to first help-seeking initiation, more premorbid schizoid and schizotypal traits and a migrant status were related to longer help-seeking duration. CONCLUSIONS Current findings suggested that family members were the key decision makers in initiating help-seeking. Longer help-seeking duration in migrants has significant implications to both local and global mental health policy.

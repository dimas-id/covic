Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV‐3) has a buoyant density of 1.197. The RNA of PIV‐3, like that of Sendai virus, is a single continuous chain which lacks polyadenylic acid sequences and tends to self‐anneal to a marked extent. It has a sedimentation coefficient of 42S and a molecular weight of 4.5 × 10(6), being slightly smaller than Sendai virus RNA (47S, 5.3 × 10(6)). PIV‐3 has 5 main structural proteins, of which 2 are glycoproteins. The molecular weights of protein(1), protein(2), protein(3), glycoprotein(1), and glycoprotein(2) were estimated to be 79,000, 68,000, 35,000, 69,000, and 55,000, respectively. Protein(2) was suggested to be nucleocapsid protein.

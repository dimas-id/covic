Human parechovirus (HPeV) infects humans early in life and typically causes asymptomatic or mild diseases such as gastrointestinal and respiratory illness but sometimes leads to more serious consequences in neonates and young infants. In 2014, we detected HPeV from 38 patients by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in Osaka City, Japan, and 33 HPeV strains were genotyped based on their VP1 sequences. HPeV genotype 3 (HPeV-3) was the most prevalent and accounted for 22 cases (66.7%) followed by nine HPeV-1 (27.3%), one HPeV-2 (3.0%) and one HPeV-4 (3.0%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that detected HPeV-3 strains were divided into three genetically distinct groups. One was characterized by a novel single amino acid deletion mutation at the N terminus of the 2A protein as well as the VP1 sequence, whereas the others were closely related to HPeV-3 strains detected in Japan in either 2008 or 2011. These HPeV-3 groups were detected from patients with various symptoms including three myositis cases. Recent papers have demonstrated that HPeV-3 was the aetiological agent for epidemic myalgia exclusively among adults from Yamagata Prefecture in Japan. Here, we provide clinical details and episodes of three myositis patients including an adult and two children in Osaka City, Japan. Our results suggest that HPeV-3 is a causative agent of myositis not only in adults but also in children.

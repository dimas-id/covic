Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has enabled steady and stable surgical procedures due to both meticulous maneuvers and magnified, clear, 3-dimensional vision. Therefore, better surgical outcomes have been expected with RARP than with other surgical modalities. However, even in the RARP era, post-prostatectomy incontinence has a relatively high incidence as a bothersome complication. To overcome post-prostatectomy incontinence, it goes without saying that meticulous surgical procedures and creative surgical procedures, i.e., "Preservation", "Reconstruction", and "Reinforcement" of the anatomical structures of the pelvis, are most important. In addition, medication and appropriate pad usage might sometimes be helpful for patients with post-prostatectomy incontinence. However, patients who have 1) BMI > 26 kg/m2, 2) prostate volume > 70 mL, 3) eGFR < 60 mL/min, or a 4) Charlson comorbidity index > 2 have a tendency to develop post-prostatectomy incontinence despite undergoing the same surgical procedures. It is important for patients who have a high risk for post-prostatectomy incontinence to be given information about delayed recovery of post-prostatectomy incontinence. Thus, not only the surgical procedures, but also a comprehensive approach, as mentioned above, are important for post-prostatectomy incontinence.

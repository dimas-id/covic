Background Corticospinal excitability depends on the current brain state. The recent development of real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) allows studying this relationship in a causal fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that corticospinal excitability is higher during the scalp surface negative EEG peak compared to the positive peak of µ-oscillations in sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for fixed stimulation intensity. Objective We further characterize the effect of µ-rhythm phase on the MEP input-output (IO) curve by measuring the degree of excitability modulation across a range of stimulation intensities. We furthermore seek to optimize stimulation parameters to enable discrimination of functionally relevant EEG-defined brain states. Methods A real-time EEG-TMS system was used to trigger MEPs during instantaneous brain-states corresponding to µ-rhythm surface positive and negative peaks with five different stimulation intensities covering an individually calibrated MEP IO curve in 15 healthy participants. Results MEP amplitude is modulated by µ-phase across a wide range of stimulation intensities, with larger MEPs at the surface negative peak. The largest relative MEP-modulation was observed for weak intensities, the largest absolute MEP-modulation for intermediate intensities. These results indicate a leftward shift of the MEP IO curve during the µ-rhythm negative peak. Conclusion The choice of stimulation intensity influences the observed degree of corticospinal excitability modulation by µ-phase. Lower stimulation intensities enable more efficient differentiation of EEG µ-phase-defined brain states.

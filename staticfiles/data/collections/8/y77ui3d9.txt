Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in Wuhan, China in 2019 (1). Respiratory symptoms remain the most common clinical manifestations of COVID-19. However, non-respiratory symptoms are increasingly being recognized. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are noted in COVID-19 patients either alone or in association with respiratory manifestations (2). Stool viral RNA can be detected by up to 50% in patients with diarrhea (3). This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

OBJECTIVE Scar-related cosmetic outcomes were compared prospectively between conventional three-port and single-port access laparoscopic adnexal gynaecological surgery. METHODS Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to a single- or three-port surgery group. Scar-related outcomes were evaluated at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. Scars were assessed by an independent observer using the modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS). All patients were asked about pain related to the scar and scar satisfaction; results were recorded using a numerical rating scale. RESULTS Seventy-three patients were enrolled between June 2010 and June 2011. Demographic and surgical outcomes did not differ between the groups. mVSS results were similar in the two groups at each follow-up point. The scar satisfaction profile measured at 1 month showed no significant difference between the groups, but the single-port access group had better results than the conventional group at all other follow-up timepoints. CONCLUSION Cosmetic outcome was better for single-port than for three-port adnexal gynaecological surgery at 6-month and 1-year follow-up.

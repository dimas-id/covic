BACKGROUND: Theaflavins are major polyphenols in black tea which is the most widely consumed tea in the world. They possess a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective effects. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of theaflavin on glycoprotein content and tricorboxylic acid cycle enzymes in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats as there was no study on this aspect. Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high-fat diet and injecting them intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.wt). RESULTS: Different doses of theaflavin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg b.wt /day) were administered orally to high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 30 days for fixing the glucose lowering dose. However, the dose at 100 mg/kg b.wt showed a significant reduction in the levels of plasma glucose and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance with concomitant elevation of insulin when compared to the other two doses (25 and 50 mg/kg b.wt). Hence, 100 mg/kg b.wt was fixed as an effective dose and used for further analysis. Theaflavin administration restored the altered glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin and glycoproteins (Hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid) and TCA cycle enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) near the normal levels by correcting hyperglycemia. Improved histological changes were observed in the pancreas of diabetic rats upon treatment with theaflavin which supported the biochemicals investigated. CONCLUSION: The effect produced by the theaflavin on various parameters was comparable to that of metformin—a reference antidiabetic drug. These findings suggest that theaflavin can replace the commercial drugs which could lead to reduction in toxicity and side effect caused by the later as well as reduce the secondary completions.

The 2019 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which was first reported in Wuhan, China last December 2019, has been declared an emergency by the World Health Organization but eventually progressed to become a Pandemic. To date, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected at least 100,000 individuals worldwide, reaching thousands of mortalities[1], [2]. In the Philippines, the number of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases is over 636 and is expected to rise.[8] Respiratory infections alongside their comorbidities can induce acute myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke.[3] These may further bring challenges in the management and administration of Intravenous (IV) Alteplase in eligible patients. Currently, there are no case reports in the administration IV Altepase in ischemic stroke patients who are COVID-19 positive. We present a case of a 62-year old female who was admitted due to cough, colds and shortness of breath of 2 weeks duration and was tested to be COVD-19 positive. She suffered from an ischemic stroke while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was given Intravenous thrombolysis.

A 25-year-old medical student presented in Multan, Pakistan with a high fever, cough, myalgia, and diarrhea consistent with the typical signs and symptoms of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient had traveled to high COVID-19-risk areas within Pakistan and had no significant medical and surgical history. Based on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing, the patient was found to be negative for COVID-19. He subsequently developed a diffuse rash and had serology consistent with dengue and measles. The patient was treated symptomatically, and his condition gradually improved over 7 days. This case highlights the high prevalence of many tropical diseases in low-income countries and the need for clinicians to consider alternate diagnoses in addition to testing for COVID-19 during the pandemic.

Abstract A 57-year-old woman hospitalized for a COVID-19 related refractory ARDS, developed, a few days later, antero-septal ST-elevation with acute systolic dysfunction. A coronary angiography was performed with the patient in prone (face-down) position, due to the necessity to maintain a reasonable oxygen-saturation during the examination.

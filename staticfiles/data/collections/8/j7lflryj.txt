Biosurveillance is an emerging field that provides early detection of disease outbreaks by collecting and interpreting data on a variety of public health threats. The public health system and medical care community in the United States have wrestled with developing new and more accurate methods for earlier detection of threats to the health of the public. The benefits and challenges of using Emergency Department data for surveillance are described in this chapter through examples from one biosurveillance system, the North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT). ED data are a proven tool for biosurveillance, and the ED data in NC DETECT have proved to be effective for a variety of public health uses, including surveillance, monitoring and investigation. A distinctive feature of ED data for surveillance is their timeliness. With electronic health information systems, these data are available in near real-time, making them particularly useful for surveillance and situational awareness in rapidly developing public health outbreaks or disasters. Challenges to using ED data for biosurveillance include the reliance on free text data (often in chief complaints). Problems with textual data are addressed in a variety of ways, including preprocessing data to clean the text entries and address negation. The use of ED data for public health surveillance can significantly increase the speed of detecting, monitoring and investigating public health events. Biosurveillance systems that are incorporated into hospital and public health practitioner daily work flows are more effective and easily used during a public health emergency. The flexibility of a system such as NC DETECT helps it meet this level of functionality.

Measles and influenza are two major diseasesâ€“caused an epidemic in India. Therefore, in this paper, a [Formula: see text] epidemic mathematical model for measles and influenza is proposed and analyzed, where pre and post vaccinations are considered as control strategies with waning natural, vaccine-induced immunity and saturation incidence rate. The dissection of the proposed model is conferred in terms of the associated reproduction number [Formula: see text] , which is determined by the next-generation approach and obtained that if [Formula: see text] , the disease-free equilibrium exists and it is locally as well as globally asymptotically stable. Further for [Formula: see text] , a unique endemic equilibrium exists and it is also locally as well as globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions, which shows the prevalence and persistence of the disease in the population.

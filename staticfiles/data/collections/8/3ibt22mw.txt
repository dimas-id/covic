INTRODUCTION Several surgical treatments exist for treatment of gastroparesis, including gastric electrical stimulation, pyloroplasty, and gastrectomy. Division of the pylorus by means of endoscopy, Per-Oral Pyloromyotomy (POP), is a newer, endoluminal therapy that may offer a less invasive, interventional treatment option. METHODS We describe and present a video of our step by step technique for POP using a lesser curvature approach. The following are technical steps to complete the POP procedure from the lesser curve approach. CONCLUSION In our experience, these methods provide promising initial results with low operative risks, although long-term outcomes remain to be determined.

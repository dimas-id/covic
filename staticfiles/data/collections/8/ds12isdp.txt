AIM The purpose was to evaluate soft-tissue healing after poly(lactic acid) (PLA(94)) mesh implantation in a rat model. METHODS Full-thickness abdominal wall defects were created in 108 Wistar rats, and reconstructed with 83 PLA(94) and 25 lightweight polypropylene (PPL) meshes. The meshes were previously gamma-ray sterilised with 25, 75 or 125 kGy to accelerate PLA(94) degradation. RESULTS The inflammatory response in PLA(94) was significantly less pronounced and collagen organisation significantly better than in PPL. The higher the level of gamma-radiation, the higher the incidence of abdominal wall herniation (22.2, 31.3 and 52.6% with 25, 75 and 125 kGy, respectively). No herniation occurred in the PPL group. Tensile strength was dramatically reduced after gamma-ray-sterilised PLA(94) mesh implantation. CONCLUSION The gamma-ray-sterilised PLA(94) mesh was poor in preventing abdominal wall hernia recurrences in a rat model.

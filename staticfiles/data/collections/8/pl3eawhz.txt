Since late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread to all parts of the country and overseas, and the outbreak continues. At the end of January 2020, the Working Group for the Prevention and Control of Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Perinatal Period of the Editorial Committee of Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics worked out the perinatal and neonatal management plan for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection (1st Edition). This plan has been verified by clinical practice for 3 weeks. With the further understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in pregnant women and neonates, it is necessary to update the first edition of the management plan so as to offer a better guide on clinical practice. Therefore, the Working Group has worked out the second edition of the management plan.

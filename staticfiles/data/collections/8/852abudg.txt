Abstract The commercial broiler industry is a modern day agricultural success due to popular consumer demand, healthy flocks, and least cost production. Preventive medicine is the key for economical control of disease in integrated broiler companies, and includes quarantine-eradication, controlled-exposure, and preventive feed medication. Respiratory and enteric diseases present a continuing, potential threat for economic loss. Most exotic and egg-transmitted poultry diseases have been controlled by reduction or eradication policies. Endemic diseases are controlled by mass vaccination and preventive feed medication. Improvements in genetics, housing, equipment, and disease surveillance has allowed continued improvements in disease prevention. Attention to detail and management of risk is crucial to industry success. With fast industry growth and market maturity of the broiler industry, new challenges have risen. These challenges include increased poultry house density, increasing economic pressures, changing industry attitudes, and increased governmental regulations that will strain the continued success of today's control strategies.

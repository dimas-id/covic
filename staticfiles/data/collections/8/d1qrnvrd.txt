BACKGROUND Although postoperative esophageal hiatal hernia (EHH) is primarily considered a post-operative complication of esophagectomy, it is also a rare post-operative complication of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG), with a reported incidence rate of 0.5 %. The purpose of this study is to analyze the incidence, clinical features, and prevention of EHH following LTG for gastric cancer. METHODS Between October 2008 and July 2014, 78 patients who underwent LTG for gastric cancer in our hospital were analyzed. We compared the crus incision group (in which the left crus of the diaphragm was incised without suture repair) with the crus conserving or repair group (in which the crus was preserved or the crus was incised and underwent suture repair). The primary endpoint was incidence of postoperative EHH. RESULTS Of the 78 patients, 7 (9.0 %) developed postoperative EHH. Three of seven patients (42.9 %) were symptomatic and required an emergency operation for intestinal obstruction. Four of seven patients (57.1 %) were asymptomatic and did not require an operation. Incising the left crus of the diaphragm without suture repair during LTG was considered the only risk factor for postoperative EHH (0 of 29 for preserving the crus or incising and performing suture repair of the crus vs. 7 of 49 in crus incision without suture repair; p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS The present data suggest that incision of the crus without suture repair is associated with EHH after LTG. If crus incision is required, crus repair may be effective for the prevention of postoperative EHH.

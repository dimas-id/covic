The COVID-19-positive patient who is subject to a hyperinflammatory condition associated with lung injury with the development of pneumonia is hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Before resolving and overcoming the “cytokine storm,” with overexpression of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-, Il-6), this patient will be intubated for more than 48 h and therefore needs adequate nutrition. Malnutrition can lead to sarcopenia with a decrease in lean body mass and worsening of the inflammatory state underway. In addition, severe debilitation, if not corrected with adequate nutrition, can greatly lengthen rehabilitation times with prolonged hospitalization, increased costs, and reduced turn over already in crisis due to the health emergency caused by coronavirus. The aim of this study is to focus attention on the nutritional importance that must be provided in case of COVID-19 together with pharmacological treatments to lower the number of circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Oral, enteral, and parenteral nutrition should always be carried out according to the patient’s condition and, in the case of a hyperinflammatory patient, such as the one affected by COVID-19, it has been shown that the supplementation of amino acids helps to lower the inflammatory state and promotes normal physiological recovery.

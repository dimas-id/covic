Poult enteritis (PE) is one of the most common diseases seen in young turkey flocks. Since 1993, more than 1800 cases of suspected PE have been submitted for examination by negative stain electron microscopy; this has involved more than 2400 individual results, because in many cases more than one virus was identified; at least 1500 individual results were positive for viruses. Viruses have been identified in poults as young as 3 days and up to 9 wk of age. The most commonly found viruses are rotavirus-like viruses and small round viruses ranging from 15 nm to 30 nm, either alone or in combination. Reovirus, birnavirus, and adenovirus have also been detected. There has been no evidence to suggest the presence of coronaviruses. This report summarizes our findings.

While scheduling problems in deterministic models are quite well investigated, the same problems in an uncertain environment require very often further exploration and examination. In the paper we consider a single machine tabu search method with block approach in an uncertain environment modeled by random variables with the normal distribution. We propose a modification to the tabu search method which improves the robustness of the obtained solutions. The conducted computational experiments show that the proposed improvement results in a much more robust solutions than the ones obtained in the classic block approach.

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has lead to a global pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Current diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR in upper and lower respiratory specimens. While sensitive and specific, these RT-PCR assays require considerable supplies and reagents, which are often limited during global pandemics and surge testing. Here, we show that a nasopharyngeal swab pooling strategy can detect a single positive sample in pools of up to 10 samples without sacrificing RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity. We also report that this pooling strategy can be applied to rapid, moderate complexity assays, such as the BioFire COVID-19 test. Implementing a pooling strategy can significantly increase laboratory testing capacity while simultaneously reducing turnaround times for rapid identification and isolation of positive COVID-19 cases in high risk populations.

A 76-year-old man with the chiefcomplaint ofmelena visited our hospital. A mass was palpable in the right lower abdomen. We diagnosed the illness as small intestinal malignant lymphoma in the terminal ileum and performed a single incision laparoscopic ileocecal resection "TANKO-ICR" with D3 lymph node dissection with the idea ofobtaining a wide visualization and surgical field. The AesculapÂ®internal organ retractor(B BRAUN)is very useful in such cases. We grasped the pedicle of the ileocecal artery using the retractor and pulled out the nylon line connected to the retractor by using ENDO CLOSETM (COVIDIEN)to extraabdomen for drawing the pedicle. Single incision laparoscopic surgery can be performed with only an umbilical wound; therefore, it is minimally invasive and has a superior aesthetic outcome. Small intestinal malignant lymphoma is a relatively rare malignant tumor ofthe digestive organs. We report this case demonstrating that single incision laparoscopic surgery was possible and provide a review ofthe relevant literature.

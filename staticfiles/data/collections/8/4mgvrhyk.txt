The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is creating significant challenges to the Canadian health system, including the practice of interventional radiology (IR). Interventional radiology will continue to play an important role in patient care, during this crisis. This document serves to guide interventional and general radiologists in safely performing IR procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, using the best evidence, guidelines and expert recommendations available. These strategies include reviewing procedural indications, development of tactics to minimize cross contamination prior to the intervention, appropriate usage of personal protection equipment according to the type of procedure (along with defining aerosol-generating procedures in IR), along with developing the appropriate work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. By adopting the policies described, hospitals will protect the interventional radiologists, medical radiation technologists, nurses, ancillary staff, along with patients who benefit from their care.

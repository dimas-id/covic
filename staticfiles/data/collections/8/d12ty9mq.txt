Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a collection of old blood and its breakdown products between the surface of the brain parenchyma and the outermost layer called the dura. The most common treatment option for primary CSDH is burr-hole trephination; however, the treatment method for recurrent CSDH is still widely debated. An arachnoid cyst (AC) is a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid located between the brain or spinal cord and the arachnoid membrane, which is one of the three meninges covering the brain or spinal cord. Although it is rare, the cyst is associated with CSDH in juveniles, and the recurrence rate of CSDH increases in such cases. Much of the literature has supported the preventive role of middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization in recurrent CSDH. We report a 13-year-old male patient with recurrent CSDH and AC where the early intervention of MMA embolization was proven effective in preventing the further recurrence of CSDH.

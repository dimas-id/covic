Many patients admitted to critical care units carry healthcare-associated multiresistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or may have a communicable infectious disease, such as pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Special measures are, therefore, frequently required to prevent the spread of these pathogens to other patients on the unit. In general, these are referred to as infection control procedures.

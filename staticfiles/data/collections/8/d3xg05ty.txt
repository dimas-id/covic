EPR has been employed in attempts to understand the basis of specific pathophysiologies in which free radicals have a postulated role. Examples described include pulmonary free radical damage, free radicals and sickle cell disease, free radicals in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, melanin and free radicals and the potential role of oxidative stress in the induction of cancer. The final section of the chapter describes the use of NMR as the spectroscopic measure of spin-trapped radicals, after they have reacted further to form diamagnetic species.

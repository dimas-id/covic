The authors describe an efficient method for generating large deletions (>200 nts) of precise length using the PCR-based method of gene splicing by overlap extension (1). This method is technically simple and less time consuming than conventional loop-out mutagenesis techniques requiring preparation of a single-stranded DNA template.

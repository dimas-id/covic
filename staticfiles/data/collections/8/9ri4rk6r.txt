AIM To compare outcomes of modified coronally advanced tunnel technique (MCAT) combined with either collagen matrix (CM) or subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) in the treatment of Miller class I and II multiple gingival recessions in the mandible. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study encompassed 91 recessions in 29 patients for whom MCAT was combined with CM on one side of the mandible and SCTG on the contralateral one. The following clinical parameters were measured: gingival recession height (GR) and width (RW), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue (KT), gingival thickness (GT), mean (MRC) and complete root coverage (CRC) and Root Coverage Esthetic Score (RES). RESULTS The MRC proportions on the CM- and SCTG-treated sides were 53.20% and 83.10%, respectively. CRC was achieved in 9 out of 45 (20%) gingival defects treated with CM and 31 out of 46 (67%) treated with SCTG. There were statistically significant differences in MRC, CRC, GR, RW, KT, GT and RES between CM- and CTG-treated sides. CONCLUSIONS Modified coronally advanced tunnel technique leads to reduction in gingival recession both when combined CM and SCTG, of which the latter is more efficient as far as root coverage and aesthetic parameters are concerned.

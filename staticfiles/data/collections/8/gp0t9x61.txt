This study tested whether Gd‐BOPTA/Dimeg or Gd‐DTPA exerts greater relaxation enhancement for blood and reperfused infarcted myocardium. Relaxivity of Gd‐BOPTA is increased by weak binding to serum albumin. Thirty‐six rats were subjected to reperfused infarction before contrast (doses = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mmol/kg). ΔR1 was repeatedly measured over 30 min. Gd‐BOPTA caused greater ΔR1 for blood and myocardium than did Gd‐DTPA clearance of both agents from normal and infarcted myocardium was similar to blood clearance; plots of ΔR1myocardium/ΔR1blood showed equilibrium phase contrast distribution. Fractional contrast agent distribution volumes were approximately 0.24 for both agents in normal myocardium, 0.98 and 1.6 for Gd‐DTPA and Gd‐BOPTA, respectively, in reperfused infarction. The high value for Gd‐BOPTA was ascribed to greater relaxivity in infarction versus blood. It was concluded that Gd‐BOPTA/Dimeg causes a greater ΔR1 than Gd‐DTPA in regions which contain serum albumin.

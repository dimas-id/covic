Although it has been encountered for a long time, the human activity recognition remains a big challenge to tackle. Recently, several deep learning approaches have been proposed to enhance the recognition performance with different areas of application. In this paper, we aim to combine a recent deep learning-based method and a traditional classifier based hand-crafted feature extractors in order to replace the artisanal feature extraction method with a new one. To this end, we used a deep convolutional neural network that offers the possibility of having more powerful extracted features from sequence video frames. The resulting feature vector is then fed as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to assign each instance to the corresponding label and bythere, recognize the performed activity. The proposed architecture was trained and evaluated on MSR Daily activity 3D dataset. Compared to state of art methods, our proposed technique proves that it has performed better.

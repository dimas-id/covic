The efficacy of a recombinant live-attenuated or chemically inactivated bivalent vaccine against rabies virus (RABV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) infection was evaluated in a lethal mouse model of infection. The vaccines were derived from the live-attenuated Street Alabama Dufferin B19 RABV platform already approved for veterinary use, where intramuscular, intranasal and intraperitoneal administration of the recombinant vaccines were avirulent in adult mice. Significant levels of serum RABV- and EBOV-specific antibodies were observed postvaccination, with levels that correlated with protection in vaccinated mice post-RABV or -EBOV challenge. These results justify further studies in guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, and highlight a promising strategy to eradicate the natural reservoirs of RABV and EBOV.

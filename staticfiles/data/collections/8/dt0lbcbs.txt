INTRODUCTION We report the preliminary results of a single-centre experience in the endovascular treatment (ET) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with a sequential endovascular thrombectomy approach (SETA), which comprehends a direct aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT) eventually followed by stent retriever thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively analyzed data from 16 patients with severe to moderate AIS and CT angiography demonstration of large intracranial vessel occlusion treated with SETA between July 2013 and March 2014. We evaluated recanalization rate, clinical outcome after 90 days as well as differential costs of aspiration and stent-assisted thrombectomy. RESULTS A group of 16 patients met the eligibility criteria to undergo ET with a baseline NIHSS score of 22 (range 12-39). In 15/16 cases, we obtained target vessel recanalization, 11 cases with ADAPT technique alone. Modified rankin score (mRS) at 90 days follow-up was â‰¤2 in 9/16 patients (56%). ADAPT technique had a lower device-related cost than stent-assisted thrombectomy leading to an overall saving of -2,747.28 . CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary data suggest that a SETA beginning with direct aspiration could be useful to optimize ET of stroke in terms of invasiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness allowing recanalization with low complication rate.

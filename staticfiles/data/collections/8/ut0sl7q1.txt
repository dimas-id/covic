In this study, we sought to examine associations between dimensions of trait perfectionism and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among a community sample of adults who experienced at least one traumatic event and determine whether the associations between trait perfectionism dimensions and PTSD symptomatology varied as a function of perceived control. A sample of 161 (57% women; M = 33.24 years, SD = 10.84 years) community adults who experienced at least one traumatic event in their lives completed self-report measures of trait perfectionism, perceived control, personality, and PTSD symptomatology. Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that socially prescribed perfectionism was associated with higher levels of PTSD symptomatology. However, this finding was qualified by a significant interaction with perceived control such that higher levels of socially prescribed perfectionism were associated with greater PTSD symptomatology only under conditions of low perceived control. Findings underscore the importance of individual differences in socially prescribed perfectionism and perceived control for PTSD symptomatology.

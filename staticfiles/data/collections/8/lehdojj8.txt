PURPOSE The proportions of select stem cells in term amniotic fluid have been shown to correlate with the type and size of experimental neural tube defects (NTDs). We sought to determine the impact of gestational age upon this form of targeted amniotic cell profiling. METHODS Sprague-Dawley fetuses with retinoic acid-induced NTDs (n = 110) underwent amniotic fluid procurement at four time points in gestation. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of cells concomitantly expressing Nestin and Sox-2 (neural stem cells, aNSCs) and cells concomitantly expressing CD29 and CD44 (mesenchymal stem cells, aMSCs). Statistical analysis was by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (p < 0.05). RESULTS There was a statistically significant impact of gestational age on the proportions of both aMSCs (p = 0.01) and aNSCs (p < 0.01) in fetuses with isolated spina bifida. No such impact was noted in normal fetuses (p > 0.10 for both cells), in isolated exencephaly (p > 0.10 for both cells), or in combination defects (p > 0.10 for both cells). Gestational age had no effect on aNSC/aMSC ratios. CONCLUSIONS Targeted quantitative amniotic cell profiling varies with gestational age in experimental isolated spina bifida. This finding should be considered prior to the eventual translation of this diagnostic adjunct into the prenatal evaluation of these anomalies. Â© 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

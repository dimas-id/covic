In March of 2014, a variant of novel porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was first identified in South Korea and found to be most closely related to the U.S. variant strain OH851. The complete genome of the KOR/KNU-1406/2014 strain was sequenced and analyzed to investigate the U.S.-strain-like variant circulating in South Korea.

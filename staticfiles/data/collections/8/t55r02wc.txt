In the past, antiviral research has focused mainly on viral targets. As the search for effective and differentiated antiviral therapies continues, cellular targets are becoming more common, bringing with them a variety of challenges and concerns. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide a unique mechanism to induce an antiviral state in the host. In this review we introduce TLRs as targets for the pharmaceutical industry, including how they signal and thereby induce an antiviral state through the production of type I interferons. We examine how TLRs are being therapeutically targeted and discuss several clinically precedented agents for which efficacy and safety data are available. We describe some of the chemistries that have been applied to both small molecule and large molecule leads to tune agonist potency, and offer a differentiated safety profile through targeting certain compartments such as the gut or the lung, thereby limiting systemic drug exposure and affecting systemic cytokine levels. The application of low-dose agonists of TLRs as vaccine adjuvants or immunoprotective agents is also presented. Some of the challenges presented by this approach are then discussed, including viral evasion strategies and mechanism-linked inflammatory cytokine induction.

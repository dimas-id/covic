Large scale biomimetic single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) coatings with significant antimicrobial activity, high Young's Modulus, and controlled morphology were fabricated using layer-by-layer assembly. Thickness was controlled within 1.6 nm and SWNT orientation was controlled using a directed air stream. This unique blend of multifunctionality and vertical and lateral control of a bottom-up assembly process is a significant advancement in developing macroscale assemblies with the combined attributes of SWNTs and natural materials.

Among the many aspects that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, two seem particularly challenging to understand: i), the great geographical differences in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality which were found in the different phases of the epidemic progression, and, ii), the potential role of the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the progression of the disease. Recently, Breiman et al. (2020) presented a hypothesis that could shed some light on i) and ii), specifically, it has been proposed that during the subject-to-subject transfer SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject, causing a potential immune reaction in a receiving subject which has previously acquired specific antibodies to the source subject antigens. This implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of i). Here we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules hypothesized in Breiman et al. (2020) are taken into account. The comparison of the model outcome with exiting worldwide infection progression data seems to support the Breiman et al. (2020) hypothesis.

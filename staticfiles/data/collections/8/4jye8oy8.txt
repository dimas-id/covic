PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of hypercoagulability in individuals affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to describe the hypercoagulable state related to the infection and provide guidance regarding the possible benefits of anti-coagulation with the support of evidence from current literature. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of thrombotic disease in individuals affected by COVID-19 is reported as high as 31%. A significant mortality benefit has been observed with the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in high-risk individuals. Literature supports the use of scoring systems, such as the sepsis-induced coagulopathy score, to risk-stratify individuals who might benefit from anticoagulation. COVID-19-induced hypercoagulability has been demonstrated to play a significant role in overall COVID-19 outcomes. Current literature shows promising evidence with the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in high-risk individuals. Further studies are needed to better analyze the risks and benefits of anticoagulation in this specific patient population.

Replication and assembly of many viruses occur in specific intracellular compartments known as ‘virus factories’. Our knowledge of the biogenesis and architecture of these unique structures has increased considerably in the last 10 years, due to technical advances in cellular, molecular and structural biology. We now know that viruses build replication organelles, which recruit cell and viral components in a macrostructure in which viruses assemble and mature. Cell membranes and cytoskeleton participate in the biogenesis of these scaffolds and mitochondria are present in many factories, where they might supply energy and other essential factors. New inter‐organelle contacts have been visualized within virus factories, whose structure is very dynamic, as it changes over time. There is increasing interest in identifying the factors involved in their biogenesis and functional architecture, and new microscopy techniques are helping us to understand how these complex entities are built and work. In this review, we summarize recent findings on the cell biology, biogenesis and structure of virus factories.

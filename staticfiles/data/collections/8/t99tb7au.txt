There have been a variety of absorbable and permanent tacks, tack deployment systems, and fasteners developed for the fixation of mesh during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The manufacturer recommendation for all systems is for perpendicular deployment of these tacks into the tissue. Achieving this optimal angle with previously developed deployment systems is often challenging and can lead to tack failure, mesh migration, and recurrence, or may require the placement of additional ports. Additionally, current tack deployment systems lack the ability to reload, leading to increased cost when entire systems must be opened each time a reload is necessary. This article presents products designed to addresses both of these problems. These deployment instruments incorporate an articulating shaft or a hinge mechanism allowing for improved access to different parts of the abdominal cavity and delivering perpendicular placement of tacks with fewer port sites. Devices with the option of reloadable fixation decrease costs and reduce waste.

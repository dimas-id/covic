BACKGROUND Surgical educators have responded to the demand for increased skills in minimally invasive surgery by offering short technique-focused workshops at academic centres. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a comprehensive laparoscopic intestinal workshop for the adoption of laparoscopic colonic surgery. METHODS A 2-day comprehensive laparoscopic intestinal surgery workshop included didactic teaching and supervised hands-on practice of numerous laparoscopic colon resections on a cadaveric model. Participants completed pre-, post- and 6-month postcourse questionnaires. RESULTS The participants (n = 39) had been in practice for a mean of 10 (interquartile range 3-18) years. Fifty-one percent (n = 20) were already performing laparoscopic colectomies as part of their practices prior to the course. Regardless of whether they were performing laparoscopic colectomies prior to the course or not, attending the 2-day workshop improved their self-assessed preparedness to perform laparoscopic colectomies. Six months after the intestinal workshop, 10 of 16 respondents who were not performing laparoscopic colectomies prior to the course had performed at least 1 since the course. Seven of these individuals had a preceptor for their first case. Reasons cited for not performing a laparoscopic colectomy since the workshop included perceived inadequate surgical skill set, a lack of preceptor and the lack of an appropriate patient. CONCLUSION A comprehensive laparoscopic intestinal workshop contributed to the perceived acquisition of advanced laparoscopic surgical skills. Local laparoscopic preceptorship was an important adjunct to the workshop for the incorporation of laparoscopic colorectal surgery into practice.

Gamma Coronaviruses (GCoVs) are distributed worldwide, affecting a wide range of bird species, the beluga whale, and bottlenose dolphins. Because of the limited proofreading capability in the viral encoded polymerase, they emerge genetically diverse. There has been no molecular surveillance data to describe the epidemiology of GCOVs in avian species. The present study was conducted to detect GCOVs in Tehran birds’ parks, 2015. Cloacal swabs (267 samples) from eight different bird species ((Chickens (Gallus gallus), Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Partridge (Perdix perdix), Quail (Coturnix coturnix), Duck (Anas platyrhynchos), Goose (Anserini),and Guinea fowl (Numididae)) were collected, the viral RNA was extracted, the RT-PCR was performed using QIAGEN one step RT-PCR kit and the primers targeting “3'-UTR” and “Nucleocapsid” genes. The detection rate was approximately 8.99%. GCOVs were detected in the chicken, quail, pheasant, turkey, and the partridge with different prevalence rates. Phylogenetic tree based on partial nucleotide sequences of the N gene clustered the samples into two groups. It is the first report of GCOVs in non-commercial birds in Iran. According to our results, GCOVs are circulating in different avian species, and further studies are needed to isolate these viruses and evaluate their pathogenesis.

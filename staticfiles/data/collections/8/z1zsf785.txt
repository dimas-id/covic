COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, which has human-to-human transmission through droplet and contact. It is commonly manifested as fever, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnoea; the severity of this disease may range from mild, severe to a critical-illness. Currently, there is no definitive treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. The only proven form of management is isolation and supportive care. Therefore, nurses have a pivotal role to play in its management. This evidence-based comprehensive literature review provides the role of nurses in the management of patients with COVID-19, which starts from the initial assessment and triaging, sample collection, care of patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms, care of the critically-ill patient, and care of the dead body.

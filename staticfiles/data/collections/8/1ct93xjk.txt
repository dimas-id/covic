Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine parvovirus (CPV) are autonomous parvoviruses which infect cats or dogs, respectively. Both viruses cause an acute disease, with virus replicating for less than seven days before being cleared by the developing immune responses. The viruses have a broad tropism for mitotically active cells. In neonatal animals the viruses replicate in a large number of tissues, and FPV infection of the germinal epithelium of the cerebellum leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, while CPV may infect the hearts of neonatal pups, causing myocarditis. In older animals the virus replicates systemically, primarily in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, and also in the rapidly replicating cells of the small intestinal epithelial crypts. A transient panleukopenia or relative lymphopenia is often observed after FPV or CPV infection, respectively. Whether the reduction in cell numbers in vivo is due to virus replicating in and killing cells, or due to other indirect effects, is not known. However, FPV kills both erythroid and myeloid colony progenitors in in vitro bone marow cultures, and it has been suggested that virus replication in the myeloid cells in vivo could lead to the reduced neutrophil levels seen after FPV infection of cats.

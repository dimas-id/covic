The present study was an attempt to raise hen egg yolk Ig (IgY) simultaneously directed against Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) in the same egg yolk. The immunopotentiating effect of 2 different adjuvants—Freund’s adjuvants (FA) and immunostimulating complexes matrix (IM)—on antibody response was also evaluated. Bacterial outer membrane proteins (OMP) were selected as target antigens. The ISA Brown hens, specific-Salmonella spp.-free status, divided into 6 groups were intramuscularly injected with a mono-compound antigen preparation: SE-OMP (treatment SE-FA or SE-IM) or ST-OMP (treatment ST-FA or ST-IM), or a combined antigen preparation: ½ SE-OMP and ½ STOMP (treatment SEST-FA or SEST-IM). Titers of antibodies in yolk were evaluated biweekly with ELISA. There was no antigen × adjuvant interaction on antibody titers. Anti-SE IgY titers in hens that received treatment SEST-FA or SEST-IM were statistically similar (P > 0.05) as compared with those obtained from hens immunized with treatment SE-FA or SE-IM. Anti-ST IgY titers in hens immunized with treatment SEST-FA or SEST-IM were slightly lower than those of hens that received treatment ST-FA or ST-IM. The cross-reactivity of anti-SE IgY, induced by treatment SE-FA or SE-IM, with ST-OMP antigen and that of anti-ST IgY, induced by ST-FA or ST-IM, with SE-OMP antigen were arbitrarily assessed on d 43 and 155 by ELISA. The average cross-reactivity of anti-SE IgY with ST-OMP antigen was 71.7%. The average cross-reactivity of anti-ST IgY with SE-OMP antigen was 78.8%. In FA groups, antibody titers were found higher (P < 0.05) than those in IM groups. Furthermore, no extensive lesions or clinical abnormalities were detected in hens injected with FA. These findings showed the opportunity to raise IgY antibody against 2 Salmonella serovars in the same yolk and that FA was more efficient than IM in mediating antibody response.

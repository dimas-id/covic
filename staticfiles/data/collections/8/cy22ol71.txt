Background: The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic disease, and the epidemiological characteristics of the disease have been reported in detail. However, many patients with new coronary pneumonia have comorbidities, and there are few researches reported in this special population. Methods: a retrospective analysis was performed on 132 consecutive COVID-19 patients with comorbidities from January 19, 2020 to March 7, 2020 in Hubei NO.3 People Hospital. Patients were divided into mild group and critical group and were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation biomarkers include the clinical feature, blood routine, blood biochemistry, inflammation biomarkers, and coagulation function. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors associated with death. Results: 132 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into the mild group (n=109, 82.6%) and critical group (n=23, 17.4%), of whom 119 were discharged and 13 were died in hospital. The all-cause mortality rate was 9.8%, of which 7 patients died of respiratory failure, 5 patients died of heart failure, and 1 patient died of chronic renal failure. There was significant statistical difference of mortality rates between the mild group (5.5%) and the critical group (30.4%).The average time of hospitalization was 16.9 (9, 22) days. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (n=90, 68.2%), followed by diabetes (n=45, 34.1%), coronary heart disease (31, 23.5%). Compared with the mild group, the patients were older in critical group (P <0.05), and neutrophils, neutrophil ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), serum urea nitrogen (BUN), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein CRP), serum amyloid protein (SSA), N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-pro BNP) were significantly increased (P <0.05). However, lymphocytes lymphocyte ratio, albumin were lower than those in the critical group (P <0.05). The patients were further divided into the survivor group (n=119, 90.2%) and the non-survivor group (n=13, 9.8%). Compared with the survivor group, the death rate of patients with coronary heart disease was significantly increased (53.8% vs 20.2%), and The neutrophil ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), BUN, PCT, CRP, SAA, interleukin-6(IL-6) and D-dimer were significantly increased (P <0.05), while the lymphocytes and NLR reduced (P <0.05). Multivariate logistic stepwise regression analysis showed that the past medical history of coronary heart disease[OR:2.806 95%CI:0.971~16.795], decreased lymphocytes[OR:0.040, 95%CI:0.001~2.306], increased AST[OR:1.026, 95%CI:1.000~1.052], increased SSA[OR:1.021, 95%CI:1.001~1.025], and increased D-dimer[OR:1.231, 95%CI:1.042~1.456] are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients pneumonia with comorbidities. Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with coronary heart disease is relatively high. In all patients, the lower lymphocytes, and higher NLR, BUN, PCT, CRP, SSA, D-dimer are significant characteristics. The past medical history of coronary heart disease, decreased lymphocytes, increased AST, SSA and D-dimer are risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with comorbidities

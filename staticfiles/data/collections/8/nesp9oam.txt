Introduction Tension-free repair of groin hernias with synthetic material by video-endoscopic surgery is a widely accepted method that is performed by various approaches. We aim to present our results of video-endoscopic tension-free repair of groin hernias via the total extraperitoneal (TEP) approach. Methods Between September 2016 and December 2018, 124 patients with groin hernias underwent tension-free repair using prolene mesh by video-endoscopic surgery via the TEP approach. This is a retrospective analysis of 110 (88.7%) male and 14 (11.3%) female patients with a mean age of 48.1 years. Groin hernia types, locations of hernias, intraoperative and postoperative complications, results of the mean 24-month follow-up, and recurrence rate were reported. Results A total of 134 hernias were repaired in 124 patients who had 53 (42.7%) right, 61 (49.2%) left, and 10 (8.1%) bilateral groin hernias. The most common hernia type was an indirect inguinal hernia in 83/134 (62%) groin hernias. A total of 119 (88.8%) and 15 (11.2%) hernias were primary and recurrent, respectively. Seroma was detected in two (1.6%) patients in the early postoperative period. The mean duration of hospital stay was 1.4 (1-3) days. During the follow-up period, hernia recurrence was determined in three (2.4%) patients. Hernia recurrence was detected among patients who were operated on during the first half of the study. Conclusion Tension-free repair of groin hernias by video-endoscopic technique via the TEP approach can be performed with very low complication and recurrence rates. The success of the TEP approach increases parallel to increasing surgical experience. The results of hernia repair via the TEP approach are highly satisfactory and encouraging, especially when attention is paid to proper patient selection during the learning curve period.

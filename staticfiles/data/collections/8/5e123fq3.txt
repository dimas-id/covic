PURPOSE Laparoscopic hernioplasty has become a popular choice for inguinal hernia repair since its advent in 1990s. Postoperative pain is an undesirable clinical outcome impairing daily activity of 22.5% of patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative acute and chronic pain via inflammatory markers as an objective assessment following tacks or glue mesh fixation in TEP repair. METHODS Sixty-six (66) patients with unilateral uncomplicated inguinal hernia were randomized into 34 patients in the tacker and 32 patients in cyanoacrylate glue mesh fixation in TEP repair. The extent of surgical trauma was evaluated by measuring inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count at 48 h, and ESR at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative acute and chronic pain was assessed by recording the visual analogue scale scores and surgical complications were recorded over 3 months of the study period. RESULTS The median CRP and WBC levels at postoperative 48 h in both groups raised significantly from the baseline values (p < 0.05), however, did not differ significantly between the two study groups at 48 h (p > 0.05). The median ESR level increased significantly at 3 months postoperatively from baseline in the glue mesh fixation group only (p < 0.05), however, did not differ significantly between the two study groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference for VAS scores at all timelines between the tacker and glue mesh fixation group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Cyanoacrylate glue mesh fixation technique as an alternative method to mechanical fixation in TEP repair is comparable to tacker and can be considered to be safe and feasible.

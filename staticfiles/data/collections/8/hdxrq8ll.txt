Approximate solutions of SIR equations are given, ased on a logistic growth curve in the Biology. These solutions are applied to fix the basic reproduction number $alpha$ and the removed ratio $c$, especially from data of accumulated number of deaths in Japan COVID-19. We then discuss the end of the epidemic. These logistic curve results are compared with the exact results of the SIR model. }

In this work, the authors designed, built, and tested a novel port camera system for single port access (SPA) laparoscopic surgery. This SPA Port Camera device integrates the monitor, laparoscopic camera, and light source into an inexpensive, portable cannula port. The device uses a 2-channel SPA port inserted through an umbilical incision, similar to traditional SPA. After insertion into a channel, the device deploys a small camera module and LED lamp in vivo. An integrated, on-patient LCD provides the view of the surgical site. The design intent of the port camera is to enhance SPA by (a) reducing the size of the SPA port through the elimination of the dedicated laparoscope channel; (b) reducing equipment cost by integrating an inexpensive CMOS sensor and LED lamp at the port tip; (c) eliminating the need for an assistant who operates the laparoscope; and (d) mechanically coupling the camera, tool port, and on-patient LCD screen. The effectiveness of the device was evaluated by comparing the video performance with a leading industry laparoscope and by performing a user evaluation study and live porcine surgery with the device. Effectiveness of the device was mixed. Overall video system performance of the device is better than an industry standard high-definition laparoscope, implying that significant cost savings over a traditional system are possible. Participant study results suggest that simulated laparoscopic tasks are as efficient with the SPA Port Camera as they are with a typical SPA configuration. However, live surgery revealed several shortcomings of the SPA Port Camera.

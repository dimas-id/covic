Italy is currently one of the countries most affected by the global emergency of COVID-19, a lethal disease of a novel coronavirus renamed as SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequence with the most studied SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly deadly pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Increasing evidence shows that these coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also neuroinvasive and neurotropic, with potential neuropathological consequences in vulnerable populations. The aim of this study is to predict a likely CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2 by studying the pathogenic mechanisms in common with other better known and studied coronaviruses with which it shares the same characteristics. Understanding the mechanisms of neuroinvasion and interaction of HCoV (including SARS-Cov-2) with the CNS is essential to evaluate potentially pathological short- and long-term consequences. Autopsies of the COVID-19 patients, detailed neurological investigation, and attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from the endothelium of cerebral microcirculation, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, and neuronal tissue can clarify the role played by COVID-19 in CNS-involvement and in the ongoing mortalities as has been in the recent outbreak.

INTRODUCTION The aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of a technique that uses solely the transhiatal approach to create a high intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis after laparoscopic transhiatal resection of the distal esophagus. METHOD Using a laparoscopic approach, the esophagi of 10 midsized pigs were dissected and transected as high as possible in the thorax, and the anvil of a circular stapler was introduced perorally into the esophageal stump. Through a midline short laparotomy, the circular stapler was inserted into the gastric tube and advanced through the hiatus to be connected with the anvil and create the anastomosis. RESULTS Development of the technique was completed within the first 6 experiments. The last 4 operations were entirely successful, standardized, and easily reproducible. CONCLUSION The technique is feasible in this experimental setting. Further studies are required to establish if there is a clinical role for this technique in esophageal surgery.

Purpose: To confirm the performance and safety of the 25-cm Viabahn endoprosthesis with Propaten bioactive surface when used in the treatment of de novo and/or restenotic TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C and D lesions of the superficial femoral artery and proximal popliteal artery. Methods: The 25-cm Gore Viabahn Endoprosthesis study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01263665) is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study that enrolled 71 patients (50 men; mean age 66.7 ± 8.34 years) with lifestyle-limiting claudication (Rutherford class 2 to 4) and lesions longer than 20 cm (mean length 26.5 ± 5.31 cm, range 20-40). The majority of lesions (92.9%) were total occlusions. The primary performance outcome was post-deployment stent length within ± 10% of the pre-deployment stent length determined angiographically by quantitative vascular analysis. The primary safety outcome was device- and procedure-related serious adverse events occurring within 30 days of the procedure. The patients underwent follow-up examinations at 1 month and 1 year. Results : The median follow-up was 12.3 months (mean 12.3 ± 0.6). Nine (12.7%) patients discontinued the study due to different reasons including 2 bypass surgeries. Angiography was available in 60 patients to determine the primary performance outcome, which was met in all cases. Two (2.8%) patients experienced a procedure-/device-related adverse event (dissection) during the 30-day follow-up. Kaplan-Meier estimates for 1-year primary and secondary patency were 67.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 53.5% to 77.3%] and 96.9% (95% CI 88.0% to 99.2%), respectively. Changes in ankle-brachial index and Rutherford category at 1 and 12 months each showed sustained improvement. Conclusion : This study confirms that the 25-cm Viabahn endoprosthesis acutely performs as intended and is safe when used as indicated in complex femoropopliteal lesions. One-year primary and secondary patency rates are satisfying and comparable to historical prosthetic bypass graft outcomes.

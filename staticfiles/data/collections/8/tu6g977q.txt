Using metagenomics and molecular cloning methods, we characterized five novel small, circular viral genomes from pig feces that are distantly related to chimpanzee and porcine stool-associated circular viruses, (ChiSCV and PoSCV1). Phylogenetic analysis placed these viruses into a highly divergent clade of this rapidly growing new viral family. This new clade of viruses, provisionally named porcine stool-associated circular virus 2 and 3 (PoSCV2 and PoSCV3), encodes a stem–loop structure (presumably the origin of DNA replication) in the small intergenic region and a replication initiator protein commonly found in other biological systems that replicate their genomes via the rolling–circle mechanism. Furthermore, these viruses also exhibit three additional overlapping open reading frames in the large intergenic region between the capsid and replication initiator protein genes.

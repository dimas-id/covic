Abstract The study reports heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris of active neuraminidase derived from avian influenza virus A/Viet Nam/DT-036/2005(H5N1). A gene encoding the neuraminidase N1 head domain (residues 63–449) was fused directly in-frame with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion signal in pPICZ(A vector. Recombinant N1 neuraminidase was expressed in P. pastoris as a 72kDa secreted, soluble protein. Glycopeptidase F treatment generated a 45kDa product, indicating that the secreted recombinant N1 neuraminidase is an N-linked glycoprotein. Kinetic studies and inhibition tests with oseltamivir carboxylate demonstrated that the recombinant N1 neuraminidase has similar K m and K i values to those of the viral N1 neuraminidase. This yeast-based heterologous expression system provided functionally active recombinant N1 neuraminidase that should be useful in anti-influenza drug screening, and also as a potential protein-based vaccine.

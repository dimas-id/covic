INTRODUCTION: Neurosyphilis is a sexually transmitted disease secondary to the invasion of the central nervous system by the Treponema pallidum. The spinal syphilitic gumma is rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of extradural cervical spinal syphilitic gumma revealed by spinal cord compression in a 58-year-old male. The epidural lesion was removed via a posterior approach. Histological examination revealed syphilis. Syphilis serologies were positive. Brain MRI showed an associated cerebro-meningeal syphilitic gumma. Antibiotic regime based on aqueous penicillin G was introduced for 14 days. DISCUSSION: Currently, there is an increase in the frequency of syphilis and changes in its clinical manifestations. Neurosyphilis can take atypical forms. Spinal syphilitic gumma is a rare manifestation and its association with cerebral involvement is exceptional. Diagnosis is based on serologies in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The place of imagery, especially magnetic resonance imaging, is essential. Neurosyphilis should be discussed as a possible differential diagnosis in evaluation of spinal and cerebral lesions.

Upper respiratory tract infections (ie, "the common cold") have several hundred causes, the most common of which include rhino-virus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. The clinical presentation varies with symptoms. Every emergency department, no matter what the demographics, cares for patients with this constellation of symptoms. Emergency physicians examine, diagnose, and treat these disorders frequently. With increasing burdens being placed on emergency physicians, it is possible to assume a diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection without generating a complete differential diagnosis. The challenge is to identify and recognize the distinctions between an innocuous upper respiratory tract infection and a life-threatening disease "mimic" or entities. This article discusses some of these life-threatening mimics.

The correlation between maternal serum antibodies in beef calves at 2 days old and protection against diarrhea induced by natural bovine rotavirus (BRV) infection was examined. Virus neutralizing (VN) antibody titers against BRV in sera from calves that developed diarrhea by BRV infection within 14 days of age (BRV-diarrheal calves) were significantly lower than those from calves that had no diarrhea. In the BRV-diarrheal calves, a positive correlation was found between the VN antibody titers and age of the onset of diarrhea. There were negative correlations between the VN antibody titers and duration of the diarrhea, VN antibody titers and cumulative diarrhea scores, and the VN antibody titers and duration of virus shedding. These results suggest that the VN antibody titers against BRV in newborn calf serum could be an indicator of protection against BRV-induced diarrhea.

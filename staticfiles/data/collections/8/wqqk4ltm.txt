The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been accompanied by a variety of potentially stressful or traumatic experiences that people may face in daily life (e.g., repeated exposure to morbidity or mortality reports across media platforms, social isolation, contracting COVID-19, supply shortages, lost income, death of a loved one). As such, it is important to consider individual differences that may increase one's risk for developing stress-related disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder) or put the health of other people at risk. Individual differences in narcissism-a multifaceted aspect of personality-may be worth examining in association with social health behaviors, stress, and trauma-related outcomes during the current and future pandemics.

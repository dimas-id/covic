In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, quality improvement teams at Cleveland Clinic initiated a number of measures to guide the care of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and protect care givers. This included increasing the frequency of team meetings from monthly to daily or weekly and creating task forces to create protocols for patient transport, airway management, and management of personal protective equipment and medications in short supply. Enterprise wide, we postponed non-essential surgeries, set up an overflow intensive care unit onsite, created a web-based COVID-19 toolkit for all care givers, and sent daily emails about the most recent developments, decisions, and recommendations from national and international societies.

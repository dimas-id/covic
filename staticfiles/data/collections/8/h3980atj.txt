Over 1100 cases of MERS-CoV have been reported since it was first identified in June 2012. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic or mild illness to rapidly progressive disease with multi-organ failure and high mortality. Treatment has been largely supportive. A large number of compounds have been shown to have significant in vitro inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV. Until recently, macaques were the only suitable animal models for animal studies, hindering further clinical development of MERS-CoV therapy. However, the recent successful development of MERS-CoV infection model in transduced mice offers opportunities to accelerate clinical development of therapeutic agents for MERS-CoV infection. Currently available evidence supports further clinical investigation of interferon-based treatment regimens for patients with MERS-CoV. Combining interferon with mycophenolate and/or high-dose ribavirin appears especially promising. Monoclonal antibodies against various targets within MERS-CoV Spike protein have yielded encouraging in-vitro results. However, their safety and efficacy require confirmation in animal models and exploratory clinical trials.

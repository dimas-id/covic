OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologies and outcome of acute respiratory failure (ARF) in HIV-infected patients over the first decade of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. METHODS: Retrospective study of all HIV-infected patients (n = 147) admitted to a single intensive care unit (ICU) for ARF between 1996 and 2006. RESULTS: ARF revealed the diagnosis of HIV infection in 43 (29.2%) patients. Causes of ARF were bacterial pneumonia (n = 74), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP, n = 52), other opportunistic infections (n = 19), and noninfectious pulmonary disease (n = 33); the distribution of causes did not change over the 10-year study period. Two or more causes were identified in 33 patients. The 43 patients on ART more frequently had bacterial pneumonia and less frequently had opportunistic infections (P = 0.02). Noninvasive ventilation was needed in 49 patients and endotracheal intubation in 42. Hospital mortality was 19.7%. Factors independently associated with mortality were mechanical ventilation [odds ratio (OR) = 8.48, P < 0.0001], vasopressor use (OR, 4.48; P = 0.03), time from hospital admission to ICU admission (OR, 1.05 per day; P = 0.01), and number of causes (OR, 3.19; P = 0.02). HIV-related variables (CD4 count, viral load, and ART) were not associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pneumonia and PCP remain the leading causes of ARF in HIV-infected patients in the ART era. Hospital survival has improved, and depends on the extent of organ dysfunction rather than on HIV-related characteristics.

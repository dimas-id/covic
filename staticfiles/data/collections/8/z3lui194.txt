Since the publication of the first complete microbial genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae in 1995, more than 200 additional microbial genome sequences have become available in the public domain. Approximately 40% of these represent important human pathogens. Comparative in silico methods, along with large-scale approaches such as transcriptomics and proteomics, are beginning to reveal insights into new virulence genes, pathogen-host interactions, and the molecular basis of host specificity. Sequence data are also starting to accumulate from multiple isolates or strains of a single pathogen, and this type of data has proven to be quite valuable in providing new insights into the genetic variability that is present in a particular species as well as in facilitating correlations between genotype and phenotype. Ultimately, a major goal of genome-enabled infectious disease research is the development of novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

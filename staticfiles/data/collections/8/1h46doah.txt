PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neonatal sepsis is a diagnosis made in infants less than 28 days of life and consists of a clinical syndrome that may include systemic signs of infection, circulatory shock, and multisystem organ failure. RECENT FINDINGS: Commonly involved bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Risk factors include central venous catheter use and prolonged hospitalization. Neonates are at significant risk of delayed recognition of sepsis until more ominous clinical findings and vital sign abnormalities develop. Blood culture remains the gold standard for diagnosis. SUMMARY: Neonatal sepsis remains an important diagnosis requiring a high index of suspicion. Immediate treatment with antibiotics is imperative.

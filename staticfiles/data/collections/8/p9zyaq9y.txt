In the context of COVID‐19 pandemic, teledermatology is being favored over in‐person consultation in order to avoid the possibility of virus transmission(1). In France, COVID‐19 wasn't known to cause cutaneous manifestations before April 6(th) 2020, when an alert about possible associated skin symptoms was raised to the general public and the professional social network(2–4). We aimed to assess the impact of alerting about COVID‐associated lesions on the activity of urgent teledermatology (TD) and the activity of dermatologic emergencies unit (DEU) of two university hospitals during this pandemic.

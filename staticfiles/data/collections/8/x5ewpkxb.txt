The enteric pathogen Lawsonia intracellularis is one of the main causes of diarrhea and compromised weight gain in pigs worldwide. Traditional cell-line cultures have been used to study L. intracellularis pathogenesis. However, these systems fail to reproduce the epithelial changes observed in the intestines of L. intracellularis-infected pigs, specifically, the changes in intestinal cell constitution and gene expression. A more physiologically accurate and state-of-the-art model is provided by swine enteroids derived from stem cell-containing crypts from healthy pigs. The objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of two-dimensional swine enteroids as in vitro models for L. intracellularis infection. We established both three- and two-dimensional swine enteroid cultures derived from intestinal crypts. The two-dimensional swine enteroids were infected by L. intracellularis in four independent experiments. Enteroid-infected samples were collected 3 and 7 d postinfection for analysis using real-time quantitative PCR and L. intracellularis immunohistochemistry. In this study, we show that L. intracellularis is capable of infecting and replicating intracellularly in two-dimensional swine enteroids derived from ileum.

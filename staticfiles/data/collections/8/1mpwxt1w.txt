BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was investigation of COVID-19 disease and its outcome in cancer patients who needed treatment, in a 90-day period. METHODS: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. RESULTS: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients' awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts.

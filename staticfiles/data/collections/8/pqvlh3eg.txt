Abstract Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading. Here, we summarized the composition of pathogens in fever clinic patients and analyzed characteristics of different respiratory virus infection. Methods Retrospectively collected patients with definite etiological results using nasal and pharyngeal swabs in fever clinic. Results Totally, 1860 patients were screened and 136 patients were enrolled. 72 (52.94%) of them were diagnosed as influenza (Flu) A virus infection. 32 (23.53%) of them were diagnosed as Flu B virus infection. 18 (13.24%) and 14 (10.29%) of them were diagnosed as COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection respectively. COVID-19 group had a higher rate of contact with epidemic area within 14 days and clustering onset than other groups. Fever was the most common symptom in these patients. The ratio of fever and the highest temperature were higher in Flu A virus infection patients than in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Flu A virus and RSV infection group, but higher lymphocyte count than Flu A and B virus infection groups. COVID-19 group (83.33%) had higher rate of pneumonia in chest CT scan than Flu A and B virus infection groups. Conclusions Influenza viruses accounted for a large proportion of respiratory virus infection even during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Beijing. No single symptom or laboratory finding was suggestive of specific respiratory virus, however, epidemic history was important for screening of COVID-19.

The challenge of closing extremity fasciotomy wounds is well known to every trauma and orthopedic surgeon. We developed a new, easy, and inexpensive dermatotraction technique based on the simple use of Ty-Raps and report on the first pilot study using this novel technique for the closure of 23 extremity fasciotomy wounds. The Ty-Rap system consists of several combinations of two Ty-Raps and four surgical staples. Immediately after fasciotomy, the system is secured to the skin by the surgical staples, and once the swelling of the affected limb is subsided, the Ty-Raps are tightened every 24 hours to 48 hours until full approximation of the skin edges is achieved. We recorded the time to closure of the wound, the time to removal of the Ty-Raps, and the complications related to the procedure. Also, a cost analyses was calculated. The mean time of approximation of the skin was 6.3 days, and after a further 9.4 days, the Ty-Raps could be removed. The majority of the wounds (91%) healed without complications, and only one patient in our series required a secondary surgical procedure for the closure of one fasciotomy wound. The total cost to close a fasciotomy wound of 30 cm with the use of Ty-Raps is US dollar 23.33. We regard the use of Ty-Raps a good alternative for the current closing techniques of extremity fasciotomy wounds. We value its low cost, general availability, effectiveness, and the fact that, in this pilot study, both the application and the tightening of the Ty-Raps were well tolerated by our patients with a minimal need for secondary procedures. Knowledge of this technique is a useful adjunct to the existing surgical array for every trauma and orthopedic surgeon for the closure of extremity fasciotomy wounds, especially in austere or military environments.

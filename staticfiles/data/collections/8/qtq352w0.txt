Abstract District planning, in general, and influenza pandemic planning, in particular, are necessary to sustain health care organizations and systems. An extensive stakeholder process used by Capital District Health Authority (CDHA) and the Izaak Walton Killam (IWK) Health Centre involved more than 25 teams. This work resulted in a joint CDHA/IWK pandemic influenza contingency plan for public health, primary care, acute care and tertiary care services. In addition, district and business continuity planning has been enhanced.

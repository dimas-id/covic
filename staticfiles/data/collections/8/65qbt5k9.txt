PURPOSE OF REVIEW The present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created additional challenges with an increased number of presumed healthy, full-term newborns being discharged at 24 h after delivery. Short lengths of stay raise the possibility of mother-infant dyads being less ready for discharge, defined as at least one of the three informants (i.e., mother, pediatrician, and obstetrician) believing that either the mother and/or infant should stay longer than the proposed time of discharge. This public health crisis has reduced the number of in-person well child visits, negatively impacting vaccine receipt, and anticipatory guidance. RECENT FINDINGS Extra precautions should be taken during the transition period between postpartum discharge and follow-up in the ambulatory setting to ensure the safety of all patients and practice team members. This should include restructuring office flow by visit type and location, limiting in-person visits during well infant exams, instituting proper procedures for personal protective equipment and for cleaning of the office, expanding telehealth capabilities for care and education, and prioritizing universal vaccinations and routine screenings. SUMMARY Based on current limited evidence, this report provides guidance for the postdischarge management of newborns born to mothers with confirmed or suspected disease in the ambulatory setting as well as prioritizing universal immunizations and routine screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

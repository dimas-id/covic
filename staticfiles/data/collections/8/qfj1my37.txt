This paper describes country-wide special measures undertaken for interventional radiology (IR) staff during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although each IR service around the world faces unique challenges, the principles outlined in this paper will be useful when designing or strengthening individual practices and integrating them within wider hospital and national measures. Moving beyond the current outbreak, these measures will be useful for any future infectious diseases which are likely to arise.

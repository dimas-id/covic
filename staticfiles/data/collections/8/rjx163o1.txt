Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) infects cells via the endocytic pathway and, like many other enveloped viruses, ISAV contains a receptor-destroying enzyme. We have analysed this acetylesterase activity with respect to substrate specificity, enzyme kinetics, inhibitors, temperature and pH stability. The ISAV acetylesterase was inhibited by di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) in a dose-dependent fashion but not by other known hydrolase inhibitors, suggesting that a serine residue is part of the active site. The pH optimum of the enzyme was in the range 7.5-8.0 and the enzymatic activity was lessened at temperatures above 40 degrees C. The effect of DFP on agglutination/elution of erythrocytes by ISAV demonstrated that the acetylesterase activity is the bona fide receptor-destroying enzyme. A haemadsorption assay was used to analyse whether the esterase was active on the surface of infected cells or not.

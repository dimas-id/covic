OBJECTIVES To report the short- and long-term complications and clinical outcomes of a cohort of dogs managed for gastric dilatation-volvulus using a modified right-sided tube gastropexy technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective case series. RESULTS Of 31 dogs treated, 29 (93·5%) had an excellent short-term outcome, and gastric dilatation-volvulus did not recur in any dog. Twenty-six dogs (84%) were initially fed via the gastrostomy tube postoperatively; three (9·7%) suffered a major complication including septic peritonitis (n=1), and premature tube removal (n=2). Fourteen dogs (45·1%) had minor complications including mild, self-limiting discharge from the stoma site in 13. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Modified tube gastropexy using a mushroom-tipped silicone catheter is an effective and safe surgical method for the management of gastric dilatation-volvulus. The gastrostomy tube allowed early enteral feeding and easy administration of medications, including gastroprotectants.

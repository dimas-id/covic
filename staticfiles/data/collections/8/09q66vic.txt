PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review highlights recent publications on hepatobiliary pathology concerning several unusual types of hepatitis, fatty liver disease, disorders of the biliary tree and other topics that have a substantial impact on liver biopsy interpretation. RECENT FINDINGS In the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many patients had abnormalities in liver function tests. Liver biopsy findings in three cases were reported that showed a generic picture of hepatitis, with exceptionally increased mitotic activity. The role of portal myofibroblasts in cirrhosis was examined in several studies. A newly described lesion, isolated ductular hyperplasia (IDH) was found in patients with prolonged abnormalities of liver function tests of uncertain origin. Hyperplastic, well-differentiated bile ductules were seen on liver biopsy in the absence of any identifiable biliary disease. Hereditary hemochromatosis is now a complex entity with various clinicopathological forms based on mutations in the HFE gene and other iron-homeostatic genes such as transferrin receptor 2 and ferroportin 1. In some of these heritable forms of primary iron overload, stainable iron is present in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. After liver transplantation, differentiating recurrent HCV infection from acute rejection on liver biopsy is problematic, with exceptionally low inter- and intra-observer reliability shown in one study. SUMMARY The hepatitis associated with the SARS coronavirus, Isolated Ductular Hyperplasia in patients with liver function test abnormalities and other topics with pathologic relevance are reviewed.

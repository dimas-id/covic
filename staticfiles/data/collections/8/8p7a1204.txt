BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of a hybrid approach (HA) versus laparoscopy in reducing the risk of complications related to complex adhesiolysis in incisional ventral hernia repair (IVHR). METHODS This study included 269 adult patients who underwent laparoscopic IVHR at the Oulu University Hospital, Finland during 2006-2012. Baseline, operative and postoperative data was collected and compared between the treatment groups; that is, a comparison was made between the laparoscopic approach (LA, 38 patients) and the hybrid approach (HA, 24 patients). RESULTS In the LA group, 11 (28.9%) patients experienced postoperative complications. There were 4 undetected enterotomies that led to major complications, reoperations and one death. In the HA group, 6 (25%) patients experienced mild and moderate complications. During adhesiolysis, 4 enterotomies occurred but were immediately sutured without any complication. CONCLUSION Adhesiolysis through a minimally invasive open technique may be associated with a lower risk of undetected enterotomy in patients with complex adhesions. In IVHR, the hybrid should be considered the operative method of choice when adhesions are foreseeable.

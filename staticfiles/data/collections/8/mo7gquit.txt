To examine the media response to severe acute respiratory syndrome, we reviewed New Zealand's major newspaper (261 articles for 3 months). While important accurate health messages were frequently included, some were missed (e.g., hand washing in only 2% of articles). No incorrect information was identified, and health spokespersons were accurately quoted.

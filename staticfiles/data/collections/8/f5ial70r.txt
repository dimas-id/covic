OBJECTIVE Fixation with percutaneously placed sacroiliac screws has become a well-established technique for fixation of the posterior pelvic ring in the proper clinical setting. This technique, however, carries with it the risk of iatrogenic injury to neurovascular structures with aberrant screw placement. Given the potential risks involved with this technique, a model whereby the psychomotor skills involved could be refined before entering the operating room may be of benefit. The purpose of the current study is (1) to describe a simulator model for SI screw placement that can be assembled from readily available equipment and (2) to attempt to demonstrate the construct validity of such a simulator. DESIGN A simulator was assembled using readily available equipment found in the hospital and at a hardware store, and the cost of set up is less than $50. Orthopedic surgeons and novice operators were then observed using the simulator and results were recorded. SETTING Tertiary referral teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS Orthopedic surgery residents, resident faculty, x-ray technicians. RESULTS This simulator has been found to be a safe and effective model for teaching junior residents the technique of sacroiliac (SI) screw placement. An added benefit to this module is that it helps train new C-arm technicians to learn how to obtain the necessary views for this procedure. CONCLUSIONS This model can be a valuable component of orthopedic training programs whereby technical and psychomotor skills necessary for percutaneous SI screw placement can be developed in a controlled setting.

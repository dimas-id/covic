PURPOSE The aim of this study was to evaluate an innovative approach for closing retinal tears using DuraSealâ„¢ (DS) hydrogel sealant in a rabbit model. METHODS Retinal detachment with a small tear was performed on 20 New Zealand rabbits. Thereafter, rabbits were divided into two groups; the experimental group received a transscleral injection of 0.1 ml DS into the subretinal space whereas the control group received sham injection of saline. Eyes were clinically evaluated using indirect ophthalmoscopy, retinal function was recorded in ten rabbits by electroretinography and the sealant's toxicity was evaluated histopathologically. RESULTS We found that the DS hydrogel was easily injected transsclerally into the subretinal space of the detached retinas with no major complications. Retinal reattachment was seen in both groups within 2 weeks with no toxicity to the sensory retina. There were no significant differences in retinal function between groups. CONCLUSION Subretinal injection of hydrogel through a transscleral route is easy to perform and may open a new avenue in the treatment of retinal detachment. However, the efficacy of the DS as a tamponade for sealing retinal tear is yet to be definite. Long-term clinical, functional, and toxicological studies are needed to evaluate its full potential for clinical applications.

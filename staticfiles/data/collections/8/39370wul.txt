BACKGROUND/AIMS A new minimally invasive laparoscopic approach for ectopic pregnancy, the laparo-endoscopic single site surgery (LESS), has recently been introduced. The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcome of this approach with conventional laparoscopy for ectopic pregnancy. METHOD A review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was performed. Electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched in December 2017 by searching the terms "single port laparoscopy" or "laparoendoscopic single site-surgery" or "single site laparoscopy" or "single-incision laparoscopic surgery" and "ectopic pregnancy." Studies comparing the 2 techniques and reporting surgical outcome were selected. Endpoints included comparison of length of operative time (OT), hemoglobin drop, length of hospitalization, number of patients requiring packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion, intra- and post-operative complication rates between patients undergoing conventional laparoscopy and those undergoing LESS. RESULTS A total of 56 studies were retrieved of which 5 studies including 460 patients met selection criteria. No differences were found between conventional laparoscopy and LESS with regards to length of OT time (even after stratification for presence of hemoperitoneum and/or adhesions), length of hospitalization, mean hemoglobin drop, number of patients requiring transfusions of PRBC, and intra- and post-operative complications. CONCLUSION The management of ectopic pregnancies with LESS does not seem to be superior to conventional laparoscopy.

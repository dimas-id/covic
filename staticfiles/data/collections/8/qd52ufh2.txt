Last week, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which runs all liquor stores in the state (and employs all the workers), announced that the stores would be closed 24/7 to mitigate against the spread of COVID‚Äê19. The announcement came on March 16, with stores to close at 9:00 p.m. the next day (St. Patrick's Day, a notorious drinking day).

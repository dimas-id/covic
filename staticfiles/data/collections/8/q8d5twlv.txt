PURPOSE: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on world healthcare system and economy is unprecedented. Currently routine surgical procedures are at a halt globally, but whether one can delay cancer procedures remains an ethical issue, and still there is no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in these critical times. METHODS: Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. RESULTS: Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a “do no harm” approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making. Safety of healthcare personnel needs to be ensured at the same time. CONCLUSION: Currently available evidence is limited by small sample size, and full impact of this pandemic on cancer is yet to be seen. However, cancer care needs to be individualized taking all variables into consideration.

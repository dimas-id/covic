Abstract Controlling animal infectious diseases and its related infra microbes is of great significance to public health, since a lot of infectious diseases originate from animal epidemics and they often threaten human health. A state feedback impulsive model is constructed to depict the transmission and treatment of animal epidemics. Basing on the impulsive model, the existence of order-1 periodic solution and its stability are proved with a novel method. The theoretical results indicate that the impulsive treatment triggered by the number of infectious is an efficient approach to control animal infectious disease from breakout. Numerical simulation is presented to support the theoretical conclusion in the end.

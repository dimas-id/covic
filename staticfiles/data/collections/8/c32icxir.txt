Specific-pathogen-free kittens experimentally infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) subsequently demonstrated increased plasma levels of the arachidonic acid metabolites, leukotriene (LT) B4 and prostaglandin (PG) E2. Significant increases (P<0.025) in LTB4 plasma levels occurred in all (5/5) FIPV-inoculated kittens on postchallenge-exposure days (PCD) 7 and 14 vs PCD 0. Significant increases (P<0.05) in PGE2 plasma levels occurred in 80% (4/5) of FIPV-infected kittens on PCD 7 and 14. Maximal mean plasma levels of LTB4 and PGE2 occurred on PCD 7 (502.5±45.6 pg/ml and 1108.0±247.9 pg/ml, respectively). A positive correlation was found between LTB4 plasma levels and body temperature (r=0.609, P<0.01). Mean survival time in FIPV-inoculated kittens was 19.4±3.2 days. Gross lesions, including peritoneal or pleural effusions (or both) and connective tissue edema, indicated an increased vascular permeability in the FIPV-infected kittens. Histologically, lesions were characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation. Immunofluorescent studies of tissues from FIPV-infected kittens demonstrated foci of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and FIPV-positive macrophages oriented around dilated blood vessels. Seemingly, arachidonic acid metabolites, including LTB4 or PGE2 released from macrophages, neutrophils or other cells, may be involved in the pathogenesis of FIP vascular and inflammatory lesions and in some of the clinical disease manifestations.

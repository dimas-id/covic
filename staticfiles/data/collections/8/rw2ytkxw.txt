AIMS The study aimed to assess the diagnostic value of serial monitoring of biochemical inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count) in the postoperative diagnosis of anastomotic leakage or ureteral injury after bowel resection for deep infiltrating endometriosis. METHODS This is a review of prospectively collected data from 217 patients who underwent laparoscopic bowel resection for endometriosis from January 2009 to April 2015. Patients with an anastomotic leakage or ureteral injury were identified and classified. RESULTS The frequency of anastomotic leakage requiring reoperation was 8.3%. The frequency of ureteral injury was 4.6%. Median time to diagnosis was 6 days for anastomotic leakage and 8 days for ureteral injury. The daily mean values of serum CRP were significantly higher in patients with a surgical complication starting at the second postoperative day (POD 2, p = 0.004). WBC was significantly higher (p < 0.05) on POD 2 and 3 in patients with a surgical complication. A decrease in CRP from POD 1 to 3 predicted an uncomplicated course in 92.1% of the cases. CONCLUSION A decrease in CRP from POD 1 to 3 was an indicator of uncomplicated subsequent postoperative course. The test is recommended when early discharge after rectal resection for deep infiltrating endometriosis is considered.

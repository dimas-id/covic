The aim of study was to evaluate various risk in patients who were hospitalized with moderate to severe virus-induced wheezing. Infants hospitalized with virus-induced wheezing were enrolled in the study. Respiratory viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal swab and total IgE levels and skin prick tests were performed in all patients. The mean age of the patients was 11.2±9 months. The most common detected viral agents were Respiratory Syncytial Virus, (33.6%), Influenza virus (16.3.%). Children with positive family history of atopy had their first virus-induced wheezing at an earlier age (9.0 ±7.8 months) than the others (14.2±10.8 months), (p=0.007). Atopy and viral etiology did not significantly influence clinical severity of the disease. Although children with positive parental history of atopy experience first virus-induced wheezing at an earlier age, personal atopy was not found as a risk factor for predicting the severity of the first virus-induced wheezy episode.

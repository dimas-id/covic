Abstract In the last decade, there has been an explosion in the use of G-quadruplex labels to detect various analytes, including DNA/RNA, proteins, metals and other metabolites. In this review, we focus on strategies for the detection of nucleic acids, using G-quadruplexes as detection labels or as enzyme labels that amplify detection signals. Methods to detect other analytes are briefly mentioned. We highlight various strategies, including split G-quadruplex, heminâ€“G-quadruplex conjugates, molecular beacon G-quadruplex or inhibited G-quadruplex probes. The tandem use of G-quadruplex labels with various DNA-modifying enzymes, such as polymerases (used for rolling circle amplification), exonucleases and endonucleases, is also discussed. Some of the detection modalities that are discussed in this review include fluorescence, colorimetric, chemiluminescence, and electrochemical methods.

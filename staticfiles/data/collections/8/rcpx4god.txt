Erythropoietin may stimulate innate immunity against RNA viruses, such as Covid‐19, through hemoglobin sub‐unit Beta acting on the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG‐1) and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) viral pattern recognition receptors, causing interferon production and also maintains the vascular endothelium, a major target of SARS‐CoV‐2, possibly reducing thrombotic events which are becoming increasingly recognized complications of COVID19.

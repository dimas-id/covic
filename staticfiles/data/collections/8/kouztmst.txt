In recent years, regulatory T cells have received increased attention for their role in immune responses to microbial infections. The list of microbial pathogens associated with regulatory T cell responses is growing rapidly and includes bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. As the biology of regulatory T cells is revealed, we are discovering that their induction during infection is a normal aspect of immunity, necessary to limit collateral damage from inflammatory responses and aggressive immunological effectors. Thus, these cells play a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between preventing immunopathology and allowing the immune response to clear infections. While generally successful, there are notable exceptions where regulatory T cell-mediated suppression appears to be responsible for allowing certain viruses to establish and maintain a persistent state. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of what virus-induced regulatory T cells are, how they are induced, and what mechanisms they use to suppress immunity. The complex role of Tregs in regulating immunity to viral infections, and the consequences their activity has on disease is illustrated by a review of specific viral infections including hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus.

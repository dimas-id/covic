In search for a suitable method for sero-ecological screenings for arboviruses in Norway, efforts were undertaken to make the immunoelectroosmophoresis technique more sensitive than here to fare in detection of antibodies. The aim was to make it comparable to haemagglutination inhibition test in sensitivity, retaining the advantages in specificity, simplicity and capacity. This has been achieved by: 1. Using concentrated virus as antigen. 2. Performing electrophoresis in a gel consisting of an agar-agarose mixture in optimal concentrations. 3. “Sandwiching” the first specific electrophoretic run with an anti-species antiserum to the tested sample.

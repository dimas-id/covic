Abstract Bacterial, fungus, and viral infections can be aggressive life-threatening infections or nonhostile relatively mild short-term infections. In response to all infectious agents, the body generates antibodies or generates resistance to infection agents. In all cases, bacteria, fungi, and viruses infect one cell or one tissue and then start to spread around the body infecting multiple other cells or tissues, in some cases killing humans. One common symptom of most bacterial, fungal, and virus infections is fever.

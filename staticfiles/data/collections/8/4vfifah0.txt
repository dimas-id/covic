Safeguarding the health and promoting the well-being and quality of life of the most vulnerable and fragile citizens is a top priority for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). In response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous regulatory policies and 1,135 waivers of federal requirements have been implemented by CMS to give long-term care providers and professionals flexibility to meet the demands of resident and patient care needs during this public health emergency. Goals for these policies and waivers are increasing capacity, enhancing workforce and capability, improving oversight and transparency, preventing COVID-19 transmission, and reducing provider burden.

BACKGROUND A number of cerebrovascular disorders produce manifestations of neuro-ophthalmologic significance. In many cases, these disorders can be treated using endovascular techniques. METHODS The material in this article was obtained from a combination of personal experience and review of the literature using PubMed. RESULTS A variety of new equipment, materials, and techniques are available to the interventional neuro-radiologist dealing with intracranial vascular lesions such as aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, and arteriovenous malformations. CONCLUSION Physicians whose patients have intracranial vascular lesions should be aware of the endovascular options available for their patients.

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of barbed unidirectional vs. polyglactin 910 suture in vaginal cuff closure on patients submitted to total laparoscopic hysterectomy. From November 2011 until March 2012, a prolective, comparative, longitudinal, non-randomized study was performed on patients submitted to total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). On entry, patients were assigned to two different groups, Group 1: Vaginal cuff closure with unidirectional #00 (n = 25) barbed suture, and Group 2: Vaginal cuff closure with polyglactin 910 #1 suture. The length of closure time and the frequency of dehiscence in vaginal vault were measured on the 14th postoperative day. We did not find significant differences between the groups on the general characteristic analysis. However, significant differences were found (P = .029) in the average vaginal cuff closure time (12.7 ± 3.1 min. for barbed suture group vs. 20.4 ± 7.1 min. for polyglactin 910 group). No dehiscence case was found in any group. Based on the results of this study, we can conclude that unidirectional barbed suture reduces the surgical time for vaginal cuff closure during total laparoscopic hysterectomy and doesn't increase the vaginal cuff dehiscence risk.

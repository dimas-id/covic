Circulating selenoprotein P (SELENOP) constitutes an established biomarker of Se status. SELENOP concentrations are reduced in inflammation and severe disease. Recently, elevated SELENOP levels have been suggested as diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We decided to re-evaluate this hypothesis. A group of healthy controls (n = 30) was compared with patients suffering from systemic sclerosis (SSc, n = 66), one third with SSc-related PAH. Serum was analysed for trace elements and protein biomarkers, namely SELENOP, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) and ceruloplasmin (CP). Compared to controls, patients with SSc-related PAH displayed reduced serum Se (91 ± 2 vs. 68 ± 2 µg/L) and SELENOP concentrations (3.7 ± 0.8 vs. 2.7 ± 0.9 mg/L), along with lower GPx3 activity (278 ± 40 vs. 231 ± 54 U/L). All three biomarkers of Se status were particularly low in patients with skin involvement. Serum Cu was not different between the groups, but patients with SSc-related PAH showed elevated ratios of Cu/Se and CP/SELENOP as compared to controls. Our data indicate that patients with SSc-related PAH are characterized by reduced Se status in combination with elevated CP, in line with other inflammatory diseases. Further analyses are needed to verify the diagnostic value of these TE-related biomarkers in PAH.

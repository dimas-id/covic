The rise in gun violence and other penetrating trauma constitutes one of the main challenges in the modern practice of Acute Care Surgery. Expertise in the emergency management of this type of injuries is needed if one is to avoid preventable complications, such as short bowel syndrome. Revisiting and sometimes repurposing old surgical techniques may facilitate this task. The use of a modified Finney enteroplasty as a bowel sparing damage control technique for penetrating jejunal and ileal injuries was studied on 87 gunshot wound victims. The results show this to be a safe and efficient bowel sparing approach to the management of these injuries.

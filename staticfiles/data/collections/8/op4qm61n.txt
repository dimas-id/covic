AIM OF THE VIDEO Mini-laparoscopic surgery is the future for most laparoscopic procedures. Although already applied in some gynaecological surgical interventions, this video is to our knowledge the first publication on the use of the mini-laparoscopic approach to sacrocolpopexy for apical and posterior pelvic organ prolapse following total hysterectomy. METHODS The concept of mini-laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy presented in this video article was performed on 12 women with post-hysterectomy apical and posterior pelvic organ prolapse using mini-laparoscopic instruments and ports of 3 mm in diameter combined with a 12-mm umbilical port. Surgery was performed with the same principles as for the conventional laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS The mean operating time was 70 min (SD Â± 12). The tensile strength of the mini-laparoscopic instruments allowed appropriate manipulation of tissue consistent with that of conventional instruments. No difficulties or complications were experienced in comparison to a conventional technique. All patients were discharged from hospital on day 1 postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS The effectiveness, safety and feasibility of the mini-laparoscopic surgical technique was applied to sacrocolpopexy. Because of the initial favourable experience, the mini-laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy could become more widely used in the future.

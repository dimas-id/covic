Bacterial infections are the most significant infectious source of morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. Bacteria infections result is both acute decompensation in chronic liver disease and mortality in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI) and skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) are the most significant sources of infection in cirrhosis. Bacterial infections can precipitate renal failure and worsening hepatic encephalopathy, and patients with sepsis and liver disease have higher rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and coagulopathy.

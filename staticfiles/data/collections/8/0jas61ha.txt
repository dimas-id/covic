PURPOSE Goal-directed fluid therapy is an integral component of many Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols currently in use. The perioperative clinician is faced with a myriad of devices promising to deliver relevant physiologic data to better guide fluid therapy. The goal of this review is to provide concise information to enable the clinician to make an informed decision when choosing a device to guide goal-directed fluid therapy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The focus of many devices used for advanced hemodynamic monitoring is on providing measurements of cardiac output, while other, more recent, devices include estimates of fluid responsiveness based on dynamic indices that better predict an individual's response to a fluid bolus. Currently available technologies include the pulmonary artery catheter, esophageal Doppler, arterial waveform analysis, photoplethysmography, venous oxygen saturation, as well as bioimpedance and bioreactance. The underlying mechanistic principles for each device are presented as well as their performance in clinical trials relevant for goal-directed therapy in ERAS. CONCLUSIONS The ERAS protocols typically involve a multipronged regimen to facilitate early recovery after surgery. Optimizing perioperative fluid therapy is a key component of these efforts. While no technology is without limitations, the majority of the currently available literature suggests esophageal Doppler and arterial waveform analysis to be the most desirable choices to guide fluid administration. Their performance is dependent, in part, on the interpretation of dynamic changes resulting from intrathoracic pressure fluctuations encountered during mechanical ventilation. Evolving practice patterns, such as low tidal volume ventilation as well as the necessity to guide fluid therapy in spontaneously breathing patients, will require further investigation.

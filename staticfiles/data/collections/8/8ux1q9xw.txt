Up to now only nine whole genome sequences of avian avulavirus 6 (AAvV‐6) had been documented in the world since the first discovery of AAvV‐6 (AAvV‐6/duck/HongKong/18/199/77) at a domestic duck in 1977 from Hong Kong of China. Very limited information is known about the regularities of transmission, genetic and biological characteristics of AAvV‐6 because of the lower isolation rate and mild losses for poultry industry. To better further explore the relationships among above factors, an AAvV‐6 epidemiological surveillance of domestic poultry and wild birds in six provinces of China suspected of sites of inter‐species transmission and being intercontinental flyways during the year 2013–2017 was conducted. Therefore, 9,872 faecal samples from wild birds and 1,642 cloacal and tracheal swab samples from clinically healthy poultry of live bird market (LBM) were collected respectively. However, only one novel hemagglutination‐negative AAvV‐6 isolate (AAvV‐6/mallard/Hubei/2015) was isolated from a fresh faecal sample obtained from mallard at a wetland of Hubei province. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of this AAvV‐6 isolate (AAvV‐6/mallard/Hubei/2015) indicated that this isolate grouping to genotype I were epidemiological intercontinentally linked with viruses from the wild birds in Europe and America. Meanwhile, at least two genotypes (I and II) are existed within serotype AAvV‐6. In additional, this novel hemagglutination‐negative AAvV‐6 isolate in chicken embryos restored its hemagglutination when pre‐treated with trypsin. These findings, together with data from other AAvV‐6, suggest potential epidemiological intercontinental spreads among AAvV‐6 transmission by wild migratory birds, and reveal potential threats to wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide.

BACKGROUND The Pipeline embolization device (PED) is a braided flow diverter that requires a combination of meticulous maneuvers to assure proper device opening and expansion. Mechanical, anatomical, or technical challenges can result in a partially deployed PED with failed expansion. OBJECTIVE To present a new alternative method of PED deployment using the Navien distal intracranial catheter (DIC) as a salvage maneuver for cases where PED opening fails with standard techniques. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a prospective, single-center aneurysm database to identify all patients who underwent endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms using the PED with the Navien distal intracranial catheter access platform. Cases requiring PED deployment within the Navien catheter were reviewed. Data was collected for patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, and technical details of the interventional procedure. RESULTS Eleven PED neurointerventions requiring intra-Navien PED deployment to fully open the PED were identified. Mean patient age was 55.5±9.9 years (range 37-76 years). Mean aneurysm size was 12.5 mm±4.9 mm (range 2-42 mm). All aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (anterior cerebral artery, n=1; supraclinoid, n=1; ophthalmic/paraophthalmic, n=6; cavernous, n=3; petrocervical, n=1). Mean fluoroscopy time was 67.1±20.5 min. The intra-Navien technique was used to open the proximal PED (n=7) and the mid-portion (n=4). Post-processing of the PED with a balloon was used in six cases. CONCLUSIONS When a partially deployed PED remains constrained despite exhaustion of standard maneuvers to facilitate opening, the technique of intra-Navien PED deployment is a valuable rescue strategy. This new alternative method of PED deployment can be used to open a stretched device with successful completion of the PED implantation.

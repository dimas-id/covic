ABSTRACT We report a patient who had travelled to Japan presented mild respiratory symptom during the COVID-19 infection outbreak period. There was transient existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his oropharynx. The RNA was absent in the six respiratory specimens that were subsequently tested. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in the acute and convalescent sera were absent. The reported case indicates that transient colonization of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract is possible without inciting any antibody response against the virus.

The therapy of patients with psychotic disorders (i.e., bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) could benefit from the constant monitoring of their physiological and motor parameters. In this paper, we present an innovative and advanced cloud based platform that facilitates the effective monitoring of such patients. A commodity smartwatch is used for biosignal and motion data collection at a 24/7 basis. The paper describes the technical details of the implemented application both on the smartwatch and the cloud server side. Technical challenges regarding the upload, the storage and the battery constraints of the smartwatch are also discussed, along with the initial results regarding data visualization and processing.

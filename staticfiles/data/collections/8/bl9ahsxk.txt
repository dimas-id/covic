The SARS-CoV-2 infections continue unabated in Ghana and globally. The identification of country dynamics of the virus, its spread, and country-specific interventions in tackling the menace including the application of geospatial technologies. This research sought to highlight the use of geospatial technologies in the fight against COVID-19 in Ghana with best practices from China where the infections originated from; present the trends in Ghana and model near future trends of the virus. It was evident that just as other places, Ghana has employed geospatial technologies and continues to ply unchartered paths in solutions. The trend in Ghana is in line with a population concentration and tends to record higher figures in the southern parts. It is modeled that through incessant mobility patterns, infections will spread through to the middle parts and then the northern parts. The research, therefore, recommends the use of infrared scanners to augment testing practices and enhanced tracing of infected persons as well as the use of drones for the distribution of essential services.

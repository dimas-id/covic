Feline bocavirus (FBoV) is a newly identified bocavirus of cats in the family Parvoviridae. A novel FBoV HRB2015-LDF was first identiﬁed from the cat with severe enteritis in Northeast China, with an overall positive rate of 2.78% (1/36). Phylogenetic and homologous analysis of the complete genome showed that FBoV HRB2015-LDF was clustered into the FBoV branch and closely related to other FBoVs, with 68.7–97.5% identities. And the genes of VP1, NPA and NS1 shared 70.7–97.6, 72.4–98.6 and 67.2–98.0% nucleotide identities with other FBoVs, respectively. The results suggested that the FBoVs could be divided into two distinct lineages, and the difference of nucleotide identities was >20–30% between the lineages.

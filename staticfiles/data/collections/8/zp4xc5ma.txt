Social distancing and quarantines have been implemented worldwide to reduce the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). However, social distancing has had far-reaching health consequences, considering that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed people to the hazard of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior. For patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which is one of the main diseases at risk for COVID-19, the impact is even greater since outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs are temporarily closed. More than ever, patients' behavior change to exercise calls for urgent debate. We propose a theoretical discussion in light of Self-Determination Theory, aiming to make PR a setting that supports autonomous forms of motivation. The scenario will not be changed in the short-term; but if other conditions hinder the development of PR in its most traditional form, the PR community will be better prepared to overcome the barriers to maintain physical exercise.

We produced a monoclonal antibody (MAb) (7G10) that has blocking activity against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). In this study, we identified the components of the 7G10 MAb-bound complex as cytoskeletal filaments: vimentin, cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, actin, and hair type II basic keratin. Vimentin bound to PRRSV nucleocapsid protein and anti-vimentin antibodies showed PRRSV-blocking activity. Vimentin was expressed on the surface of MARC-145, a PRRSV-susceptible cell line. Simian vimentin rendered BHK-21 and CRFK, nonsusceptible cell lines, susceptible to PRRSV infection. These results suggest that vimentin is part of the PRRSV receptor complex and that it plays an important role in PRRSV binding with the other cytoskeletal filaments that mediate transportation of the virus in the cytosol.

A scaffold that mimics physicochemical structure of nerve and supplies calcium ions in axonal environment is an attractive alternative for nerve regeneration, especially when applied in critical nerve defect. Various scaffold material, design, including their combination with several growth- induced substances and cells application have been being investigated and used in the area of nerve tissue engineering. However, the development remains challenges today because they are still far from ideal concerning their stability, reproducibility, including complicated handling related to the poor mechanical strength. In view of the current basis, in this study the introduction of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) as promising candidate to increase mechanical properties of nerve scaffold is reported. The incorporation of CHA was not only expected to provide better mechanical properties of the scaffold. Under physiological condition, CHA is known to be the most stable phases of calcium phosphate compound. Therefore, CHA was expected to provide controlled release calcium for better axonal environment and promote fasten nerve regeneration. This study shows that CHA incorporated gelatin membrane has ideal microstructure to prevent fibrous tissue ingrowth into the injury site, while retaining its capability to survive nerve tissue by allowing adequate glucose and specific proteins diffusion. The provided Ca2+ release to the environment promoted neuronal growth, without suppressing acetylcholine esterase release activity. Neurite elongation was dramatically higher in the gelatin membrane incorporated with CHA. Introduction of CHA into gelatin membrane represents a new generation medical device for nerve reconstruction, with CHA was considered as a promising factor.

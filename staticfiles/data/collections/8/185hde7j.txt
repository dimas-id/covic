Security of computer systems is now a critical and evolving issue. Current trends try to use behavioural biometrics for continuous authorization. Our work is intended to strengthen network user authentication by a software interaction analysis. In our research, we use HTTP request (URLs) logs that network administrators collect. We use a set of full-convolutional autoencoders and one authentication (one-class) convolutional neural network. The proposed method copes with extensive data from many users and allows to add new users in the future. Moreover, the system works in a real-time manner, and the proposed deep learning framework can use other user behaviour- and software interaction-related features.

Abstract A small group of mucosal Human Papillomaviruses are the causative agents of cervical cancer and are also associated with other types of cancers. Certain cutaneous Human Papillomaviruses seem to have a role as co-factors in the UV-induced carcinogenesis of the skin. The main mechanism of the tumorigenesis induced by Human Papillomaviruses is linked to the transforming activity of the viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins. However, other mechanisms, such as the gene expression control by specific microRNAs expression and deregulation of immune inflammatory mediators, may be important in the process of transformation. In this context, the release of Extracellular Vesicles with a specific cargo (microRNAs involved in tumorigenesis, mRNAs of viral oncoproteins, cytokines, chemokines) appears to play a key role.

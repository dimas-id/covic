An 18-month-old domestic short-haired neutered male cat presented with a nodular dermal thickening on a digit. Biopsy demonstrated pyogranulomatous inflammation with moderately frequent acid-fast bacilli. A member of theMycobacterium terrae complex was isolated. There was no evidence of systemic involvement. Treatment was initiated with enrofloxacin, rifampicin and clarithromycin. After 2 months there was no longer any clinically apparent dermal thickening. Treatment was continued for a further 3 months using enrofloxacin and rifampicin.

In the current COVID 19 pandemic, the only treatments are supportive as no definitive pharmacological intervention is available. The heterogeneity of the immune response in different patient groups is clear with less severe illness in children. Understanding these disparities is particularly important as severely affected patients with COVID19 cannot always be predicted before they experience a cytokine storm and multiorgan dysfunction. Over 100 years ago, the concept of individualised immunotherapy was introduced by Sir Almroth Wright and immortalised in GB Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma. Shaw's play The Doctor's Dilemma explores the issues of private medical practice, equality of health care delivery, rationing of scarce resources (intensive care) and high-risk therapies. The play also describes the dilemma of rationing of resources and selecting the correct patient for new experimental therapies. Immunological theories of the time are now reflected in current understanding of inflammatory responses in sepsis and immunomodulation during the COVID19 pandemic.

Molecular network data are increasingly becoming available, necessitating the development of well performing computational tools for their analyses. Such tools enabled conceptually different approaches for exploring human diseases to be undertaken, in particular, those that study the relationship between a multitude of biomolecules within a cell. Hence, a new field of network biology has emerged as part of systems biology, aiming to untangle the complexity of cellular network organization. We survey current network analysis methods that aim to give insight into human disease.

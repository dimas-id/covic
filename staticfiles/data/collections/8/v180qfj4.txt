OBJECTIVE To study the relationship between ambient air pollution and daily mortality of SARS in Beijing. METHODS The approach of time-series Poisson regression was used to assess the relationship between daily SARS mortality, ambient air pollution, and other factors from April 25 to May 31, 2003 in Beijing. RESULTS An increase of each 10 microg/m3 over a 5-day moving average of PM10, SO2 and NO2 corresponded to 1.06 (1.00-1.12), 0.74 (0.48-1.13) and 1.22 (1.01-1.48) relative risks (RRs) of daily SARS mortality, respectively. The relative risks (RRs) values depended largely on the selection of lag days. CONCLUSION The daily mortality of SARS might be associated with certain air pollutants in Beijing.

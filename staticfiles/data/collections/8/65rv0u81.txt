The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a blocking test was used to determine the prevalence of enteric coronavirus excretion among the population of Bangkok and Khon Kaen province. The results indicated that coronaviruses were present in fecal samples from both children and adults with or without diarrhea. It is interesting that the viruses were more frequently observed in the apparently healthy individuals in Bangkok than in the patients with diarrhea whereas the excretion rates were approximately alike in both groups in Khon Kaen province. Among children aged less than 5 years (with or without diarrhea) the viruses were more frequently observed in stools from young children (1-5 years old) than from the newborn (less than 1-year-old) particularly those living in the Bang Khen slum area and in the rural Khon Kaen community. The rate of coronavirus excretion did not increase with age and some apparently healthy individuals continued to excrete the viruses for several months. The results also suggested that chronic parasitic infection associated with low socioeconomic status might influence the excretion of enteric coronaviruses in the feces.

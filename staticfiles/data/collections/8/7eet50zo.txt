Proteases play a pivotal role in several biological processes, from digestion, cell proliferation, and differentiation to fertility. Deregulation of protease metabolism can result in several pathological conditions (i.e., cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and others). Therefore, monitoring proteolytic activity in real time could have a fundamental role in the early diagnosis of these diseases. Herein, the main approaches used to develop biosensors for monitoring proteolytic activity are reviewed. A comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach is provided along with a discussion of their importance and promising opportunities for the early diagnosis of severe diseases. This new era of biosensors can be characterized by the ability to control and monitor biological processes, ultimately improving the potential of personalized medicine.

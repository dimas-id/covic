Abstract Viral gastroenteritis (VGE) is an acute, self-limiting gastrointestinal infection caused by several viruses which most often trigger nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. It is one of the most common human illnesses with its greatest impact on the very young and elderly. In the developing world, VGE can be life threatening whereas in most developed countries, it is self-limited and managed with hydration. Most agents of VGE are spread by the fecal oral route or may occur in explosive outbreaks due to food or water contamination. Control of these infections depends upon proper food handling, hand hygiene, clean water and the rotavirus vaccination of infants. This chapter will discuss the common viruses which cause this syndrome.

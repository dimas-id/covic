Technical developments have made laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery increasingly more feasible for treating gynecological conditions, including cancer. However, complex surgeries such as radical hysterectomy have rarely been performed with single-port access because of technical difficulties. The majority of the difficulties are due to the inefficient retraction of tissue during dissection. Here, we report a detailed description of LESS radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymph node dissection that was successfully performed in two patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer. We used our expertise with LESS to perform space development as much as possible before the ligaments were resected. The oncologic clearance was comparable to that of conventional laparoscopic radical hysterectomy.

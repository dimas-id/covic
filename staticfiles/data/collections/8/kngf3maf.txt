Since development of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection in 1991 in Japan, laparoscopic gastrectomy (LAG) is improving and evolving. Recently, advanced LAG techniques including D2 lymph node dissection or anastomosis after total gastrectomy have been developed. Retrospective and prospective multicenter studies have been conducted for early and non-early gastric cancers to establish high-quality evidence. This review summarizes the current trends of minimally invasive approaches for gastric cancer based on current Japanese experiences.

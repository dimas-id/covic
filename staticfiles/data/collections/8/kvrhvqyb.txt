Alcohol (ethanol) use disorder is associated with changes in frontal cortical areas including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that contribute to cognitive deficits, uncontrolled drinking, and relapse. Acute ethanol exposure reduces intrinsic excitability of lateral OFC (lOFC) neurons, while chronic exposure and long-term drinking influence plasticity of intrinsic excitability and function of glutamatergic synapses. However, the time course that these adaptations occur across a history of ethanol drinking is unknown. The current study examined whether short-term and long-term voluntary ethanol consumption using an intermittent access paradigm would alter the biophysical properties of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the ACC and lOFC. Neuronal spiking varied in the ACC with an initial increase in evoked firing after 1 d of drinking followed by a decrease in firing in mice that consumed ethanol for one week. No difference in lOFC spike number was observed between water controls and 1-d ethanol drinking mice, but mice that consumed ethanol for one week or more showed a significant increase in evoked firing. Voluntary ethanol drinking for 4 weeks also produced a total loss of ethanol inhibition of lOFC neurons. There was no effect of drinking on excitatory or inhibitory synaptic events in ACC or lOFC neurons across all time points in this model. Overall, these results demonstrate that voluntary drinking alters neuronal excitability in the ACC and lOFC in distinct ways and on a different time scale that may contribute to the impairment of prefrontal cortex-dependent behaviors observed in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD).

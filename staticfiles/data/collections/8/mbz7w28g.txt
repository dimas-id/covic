Sepsis is commonly known to affect neonatal outcomes. We assessed how much center-to-center variability of the sepsis rate affects the outcomes of very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWIs). 7,493 VLBWIs registered in the Korean Neonatal Network from 2013 to 2016 were classified into three groups according to the sepsis rate: low sepsis group (LS) < 25(th) percentile versus intermediate sepsis group (IS) 25(th)–75(th) versus high sepsis group (HS) ≥ 75(th). The incidence density of sepsis for the LS, IS, and HS groups were 1.17, 3.17, and 8.88 cases/1,000 person-days. After propensity score matching was done for multiple antenatal and perinatal factors, the odds ratio of death, moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or death, periventricular leukomalacia, and survival without major morbidities for the HS group were 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.4–2.8), 1.9 (1.5–2.4), 1.5 (1.1–2.3) and 0.7 (0.5–0.8) when compared with the IS group, and 2.2 (1.6–3.2), 2.3 (1.8–2.9), 2.0 (1.3–2.9), and 0.7 (0.6–0.9) when compared with the LS group. There were no significant differences in those outcomes between the LS and IS groups. Hence, nationwide quality improvements to control the sepsis rate especially in units with a high sepsis rate will be helpful to improve the outcomes of VLBWIs.

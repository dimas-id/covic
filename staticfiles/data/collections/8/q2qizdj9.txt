Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious disease that has led to large hospital and community outbreaks, necessitating stringent infection control in its management. Among 90 SARS patients in our institution in the 2003 outbreak, 2 underwent cardiac catheterization. We report the personal respiratory protection and environmental control measures implemented to minimize the risk of droplets spread during these procedures, including re-engineering of the ventilation system of the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL). The report highlights the importance of collaboration of CCL personnel with relevant hospital engineering and management teams to develop a contingency infection control plan to prepare for future outbreaks of SARS or other epidemics.

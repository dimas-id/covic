Early identification of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) who require ICU care is important as delayed transfer is associated with increased mortality. In such patients, aggressive diagnostic testing is warranted given the increased probability of detecting a pathogen resistant to usual empirical therapy. Despite aggressive culture and other routine diagnostic testing, the majority of cases of SCAP remain without a definitive etiology. Early coverage of S. pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and L. pneumophila is crucial and adequate in the absence of risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens. Combination antibiotics with a beta-lactam and either a macrolide or fluoroquinolone are strongly recommended. When methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is suspected, linezolid is superior to vancomycin. Several aspects of managing severe CAP remain without consensus, including risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, need for suppression of exotoxin production, the role of procalcitonin, and adjunctive treatment with corticosteroids and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) widely known as COVID-19 was first reported in late December 2019, in China. Since then this novel coronavirus has spread throughout the world. Our return to normal life will not take long, for we are in a phase where the COVID-19 curve is stabilizing.

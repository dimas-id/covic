Hyponatremia is the most prevalent electrolyte disorder in Intensive Care Units. It is associated with an increase in morbidity, mortality and hospital stay. The majority of the published studies are observational, retrospective and do not include critical patients; hence it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Moreover, the lack of clinical evidence has led to important dissimilarities in the recommendations coming from different scientific societies. Finally, etiopathogenic mechanisms leading to hyponatremia in the critical care patient are complex and often combined, and an intensive analysis is clearly needed. A study was therefore made to review all clinical aspects about hyponatremia management in the critical care setting. The aim was to develop a Spanish nationwide algorithm to standardize hyponatremia diagnosis and treatment in the critical care patient.

We report on the analysis of scanpath data captured by an eye tracker as students solved problems with access to worked examples. Our work makes two contributions: (1) it reports on scanpath analysis using the MultiMatch tool, (2) it investigates how type of problem-example similarity and assistance influenced attention patterns captured by scanpaths. We show that both problem-example similarity and type of assistance impact scanpaths.

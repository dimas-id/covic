RATIONALE: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes a novel, atypical pneumonia that has brought huge public health challenges across the globe. There is limited data about patients with end-stage renal disease who also suffer from COVID-19. In this report, we discuss the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in the clinical course. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and was taking regular hemodialysis was admitted to hospital for a fever and dry cough. The patient, who also had cardiovascular disease, had no history of contact with COVID-2019 patients. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-2019 by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and his pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. INTERVENTION: The treatment was mainly supportive and the patient was intensively monitored. He was treated with oxygen, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and methylprednisolone. The patient took continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) every 2 days. OUTCOMES: After 19 days, an RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, and computed tomography (CT) of the patient's thorax indicated that the pulmonary inflammatory exudation was absorbed and pulmonary infection improved significantly. He was discharged on day 29 after recovering from COVID-2019 pneumonia. LESSONS: The courses of disease and treatment options for this individual were significantly more complicated than those for ordinary patients. Therefore, it was necessary to monitor the condition of the patient closely and to protect the dialysis unit staff from being infected. Compared with other severe COVID-2019 cases, this patient recovered more quickly following treatment, which was likely due to the removal of inflammatory mediators by CRRT. This implies that blood purification might be an important option for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19.

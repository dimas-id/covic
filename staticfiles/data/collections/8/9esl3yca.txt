Device therapy for the treatment of uncontrolled and resistant hypertension has evolved significantly over the past several decades. Both renal artery disease and sympathetic hyperactivity have been linked to resistant hypertension. This manuscript will review the current evidence base supporting device therapy (e.g., renal artery revascularization, sympathetic nervous system modulation) for resistant hypertension.

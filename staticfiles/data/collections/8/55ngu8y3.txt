Only three months after its emergence, that tiny virus is changing the values and behavior of human race In order to protect ourselves, not only about "experts" such as scientists and politicians, but also about ordinary people have to think about it So, what kind of information do we need? What are the issues and controversy? I would like to think about how to make an article called "Thinking about COVID-19" as an example of science communication At this time, it would be useful to look back on SARS I hope that this paper will be useful not only for science communicators who write articles, but also for those who want to think more broadly about how to grasp and consider the problems posed by reality and how to communicate science and technology by taking a meta-view of the problems and their treatment I readily welcome any suggestions or criticisms

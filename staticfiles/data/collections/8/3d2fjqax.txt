INTRODUCTION We have combined the minimally invasive single-port laparoscopic surgery and the transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) for rectal cancer with the goal to standardize the approach and improve the quality of rectal cancer resection. METHODS By using two single-port platforms, selected patients were first operated by TaTME, and then a single-port laparoscopic surgery was introduced to assist and complete the abdominal portion. Short-term outcomes including perioperative outcome and pathologic results of these patients were evaluated. RESULTS Between July 2014 and March 2015, six patients with low rectal cancer (five males and one female) at a median age of 68 years were successfully operated in a median time of 360 min (range 310-420). The median estimated blood loss was 150 ml (range 50-800). In one patient, the spleen was removed because of a lesion identified preoperatively. Their postoperative recovery was uneventful except one acute myocardial infarction on postoperative day 3. Pathologic specimens showed negative margins and a complete excision of the mesorectum in all cases. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 11.5 (range 4-12). At a median follow-up of 4 months (range 3-9), after ileostomy closure, none of the patients suffered from fecal incontinence. CONCLUSION TaTME assisted by abdominal single-port may be safely achieved in selected rectal cancer patients.

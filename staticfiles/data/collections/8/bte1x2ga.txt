AIMS The role of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against tissue factor (aODN/TF) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) subjected to anoxia-reoxygenation (A/R) was investigated. METHODS HUVECs were divided randomly into control group, A/R group, aODN/TF+A/R group, sense oligodeoxynucleotide (sODN/TF) + A/R group and mismatched oligodeoxynucleotide (mODN/TF) + A/R group, in the latter 3 groups, HUVECs were transfected with aODN/TF, sODN/TF and mODN/TF respectively. HUVECs in all A/R groups underwent 3 hrs of anoxia and followed by 2 hrs of reoxygenation. In order to investigate the potential mechanisms of how increased TF may contribute to A/R injury in HUVECs, another set of HUVECs were incubated with human recombinant active site blocked factor VII (FVIIai) during A/R. RESULTS After A/R, TF expression at both mRNA and protein level was increased, furthermore, cell viability and the concentrations of SOD, GSH-PX and NO were declined, while LDH, MDA and ET-1 were overproduced (P<0.05 to 0.001 versus control group). In HUVECs of aODN/TF+A/R group, however, TF expression was inhibited, while the declined cell viability and the concentrations of SOD, GSH-PX, NO as well as the enhanced LDH, MDA and ET-1 levels occurred during A/R were ameliorated and reversed effectively (P<0.05 to 0.01 versus those in other A/R groups). The results also showed that ROS was increased and PAR-1, PAR-2, p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase were all activated after A/R (P<0.001 versus HUVECs under normoxia), while FVIIai inhibited the increment of ROS, PAR-1, PAR-2, p38 MAP kinase and p42/44 MAP kinase, and improved the changes of TF:C, MDA, SOD, GSH-PX, cell viability and LDH occurred during A/R (P<0.05 to 0.001 versus HUVECs without FVIIai treatment). CONCLUSION Tissue factor plays an important role in the development of HUVECs injury induced by anoxia-reoxygenation, inhibition of TF with antisense oligodeoxynucleotide is an effective approach to ameliorate the damage.

We empirically investigate the impact of economic uncertainty related to global pandemics on the volatility of the broad commodity price index as well as on the sub-indexes of crude oil and gold. The results show that uncertainty related to pandemics have a strong negative impact on the volatility of commodity markets and especially on crude oil market, while the effect on gold market is positive but less significant.

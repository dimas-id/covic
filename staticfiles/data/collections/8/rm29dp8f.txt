The architecture of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus includes three different structural levels, the envelope, an internal core, and the nucleocapsid that is released when the core is disrupted. Starting from purified virions, core structures have been reproducibly isolated as independent entities. The cores were stabilized at basic pH and by the presence of divalent cations, with Mg(2+) ions more effectively contributing to core stability. Core structures showed high resistance to different concentrations of detergents, reducing agents, and urea and low concentrations of monovalent ions (<200 mM). Cores were composed of the nucleoprotein, RNA, and the C domain of the membrane (M) protein. At high salt concentrations (200 to 300 mM), the M protein was no longer associated with the nucleocapsid, which resulted in destruction of the core structure. A specific ionic interaction between the M protein carboxy terminus and the nucleocapsid was demonstrated using three complementary approaches: (i) a binding assay performed between a collection of M protein amino acid substitution or deletion mutants and purified nucleocapsids that led to the identification of a 16-amino-acid (aa) domain (aa 237 to 252) as being responsible for binding the M protein to the nucleocapsid; (ii) the specific inhibition of this binding by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) binding to a carboxy-terminal M protein domain close to the indicated peptide but not by MAbs specific for the M protein amino terminus; and (iii) a 26-residue peptide, including the predicted sequence (aa 237 to 252), which specifically inhibited the binding. Direct binding of the M protein to the nucleoprotein was predicted, since degradation of the exposed RNA by RNase treatment did not affect the binding. It is proposed that the M protein is embedded within the virus membrane and that the C region, exposed to the interior face of the virion in a population of these molecules, interacts with the nucleocapsid to which it is anchored, forming the core. Only the C region of the M protein is part of the core.

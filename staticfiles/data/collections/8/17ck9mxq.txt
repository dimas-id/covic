PURPOSE The beneficial effect of endovascular treatment (EVT) for patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) remains uncertain. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinical outcome of EVT for patients with ABAO and analyze prognostic factors of good outcome. METHODS From our prospectively established database, we reviewed all patients with ABAO receiving EVT during January 2014 to December 2016. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. Favorable functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 assessed at 3-month follow-up. The association between clinical and procedural characteristics and functional outcome was assessed. RESULTS Of the 68 patients included, 50 patients (73.5%) received mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever device. Successful reperfusion (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grades 2b-3) was achieved in 61 patients (89.7%). Overall favorable functional outcome was reached by 31 patients (45.6%). In univariate analysis, Glasgow Coma Scale sum score, baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale score (NIHSS), and baseline glycemia level were identified predicting good clinical outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that lower NIHSS was the only independent risk factor of favorable functional outcome (OR 0.832; 95% CI, 0.715-0.968; p = 0.018). No difference of favorable outcomes was observed between the subgroups of time to EVT < 6 h and â‰½ 6 h. CONCLUSIONS Data in the present study suggests that EVT for ABAO patients should be reasonable within 24 h of symptom onset. The most important factor determining clinical outcome is initial stroke severity.

BACKGROUND: Noackâ€™s leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros ruber, is a cryptic species within the Hipposideros caffer species complex. Despite a widespread distribution in Africa and being host to potentially zoonotic viruses, the genetic structure and ecology of H. ruber is poorly known. Here we describe the development of 11 novel polymorphic microsatellite loci to facilitate the investigation of genetic structure. FINDINGS: We selected 20 microsatellite sequences identified from high throughput sequence reads and PCR amplified these for 38 individuals, yielding 11 consistently amplifying and scorable loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 12, and observed heterozygosities from 0.00 to 0.865. No evidence of linkage disequilibrium was observed, and nine of the markers showed no departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We demonstrate successful amplification in two closely related species and two divergent lineages of the H. caffer species complex. CONCLUSIONS: These new markers will provide a valuable tool to investigate genetic structure in the poorly understood Hipposideros caffer species complex.

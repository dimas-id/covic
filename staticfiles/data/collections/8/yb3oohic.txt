PURPOSE OF REVIEW Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), the main product of which is Ang 1-7, which binds to its receptor, Mas, is an important member of the renin-angiotensin system. RECENT FINDINGS A substantial body of research indicates that ACE2 is cardioprotective and renoprotective. ACE2 participates in a pathway that is counterregulatory to the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II). The mechanisms by which the protective effects of ACE2 occur are just beginning to be elucidated. SUMMARY As ACE2 appears to exert protective effects within the kidney and vasculature, recent data indicate that how it is expressed, what regulates it, and how it interacts with other biological systems may ultimately have clinical implications.

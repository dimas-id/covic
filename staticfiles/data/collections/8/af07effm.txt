There is a heightened concern for exposure to infectious aerosols during the intubation of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) patients. We took our previously designed portable, inexpensive, and easily constructed device and modified it for the prehospital setting. Using polyvinyl chloride pipe and automobile collision wrap, a prehospital unit can be constructed in less than 30 minutes, and the cost of material is under 50 U.S. dollars. The box stores easily in an ambulance and can be assembled on the scene within two minutes. This easily built device likely provides some limited protection from aerosolization during video laryngoscopy and can be replicated easily.

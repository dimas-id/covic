Due to COVID-19 outbreaks worldwide, the academic institutions have been enforced to entirely cancel face-to-face teaching including laboratories and other learning experiences as a mitigation step against the risk posed by the Coronavirus. Accordingly, various measures by the higher education providers have been initiated to implement social isolation strategies, and online teaching is followed with rapid curriculum transformation. The online delivery is more convenient, as it can provide vibrant and dynamic teaching and learning environment. However, due to time constraint, the curriculum transformation is anticipated to occur rapidly without sufficient preparation. Therefore, in this study, the concept of the emergency remote teaching (ERT) including its application and evaluation is thoroughly discussed. The application of the ERT in the Middle East College Oman has been considered as case study. This study draws on CIPP evaluation model to assess the effectiveness of the adopted model, and qualitative data were collected online taking random samples of students and educators. Besides, interview and questionnaire responses, experiences, beliefs, and challenges encountered by the educators and students on the emergency remote teaching were used and analyzed. In addition, students’ weekly attendance segregated with session modes, levels and module nature were considered to evaluate the students’ participation to the online classes. The collected information were analyzed, and based on the analysis outcomes, recommendations were forwarded to serve as an input for future strategies and policies and to improve the performance of teaching learning activities during similar circumstances.

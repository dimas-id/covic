Following lockdowns in countries around the world, reports emerged of a 'surge' or 'spikes' in the number of domestic violence and abuse cases It is critical to contextualise this: more men are not starting to be abusive or violent;rather, the patterns of abuse are becoming more frequent Spiking and surging make us think in terms of more one-off incidents but it is more likely that the pattern of abuse that is already there is increasing in terms of frequency and type because both parties remain together at all times Amid such a crisis, it is imperative that we continue to see the dynamics of domestic violence and abuse as both a pattern of abusive behaviours and a product of gendered social and cultural norms, rather than a reaction to a specific factor or event, such as COVID-19

Abstract: Bioactive peptides are protein fragments which have a positive impact on the functions and conditions of living beings. Peptides have shown several useful properties for human health, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, and antitumor activities. These compounds are produced by almost all species of life. However, they are produced in limited quantities in nature. As a result, researchers have tried to synthesize bioactive peptides to study their properties and applications in various areas. Among their applications in food preservation, peptides have been incorporated into packaging materials. This review begins with a brief description of the methods used for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides. Also, the main bioproperties and mechanisms of action of peptides are discussed. Finally, some applications of peptides are presented, especially their use in active packaging, their effects on the polymeric matrix, and peptide migration.

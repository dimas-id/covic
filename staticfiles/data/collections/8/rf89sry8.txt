BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most malignant cancers threatening human health. The miR-17-92 gene cluster is a highly conserved oncogene cluster encoding six miRNAs: miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a and miR-92a. This study explored whether these miRNAs can be used as diagnostic markers for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Serum samples were collected from healthy subjects (n = 23) and NSCLC patients at various stages (n = 74). Serum RNA was extracted by the TRIzol-glycogen method, and cDNA libraries were constructed by reverse transcription. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect the expression levels of the 6 miRNAs. RESULTS: The expression levels of the six miRNAs varied in different stages of NSCLC. Thus, two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, i.e., normal subjects and stage I-III patients and normal subjects and stage IV patients, of each miRNA were established to determine the interval of normal Î”Ct values. The two areas under the curve (AUCs) of each miRNA were investigated (miR-17: 0.8097 and 1.000; miR-18a: 0.7388 and 0.9907; miR-19a/19b: 0.8451 and 0.5104; miR-20a: 0.8975 and 1.000; miR-92a: 0.8097 and 0.8342). In addition, a high positive correlation was discovered between miR-17 and miR-20a expression. Combining these two miRNAs can improve the screening effect of NSCLC. CONCLUSION: The miR-17-92 gene cluster can likely serve as a diagnostic marker in NSCLC.

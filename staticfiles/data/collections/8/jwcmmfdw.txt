Asarum caudigerum (Aristolochiaceae) is a paleoherb species that is important for research in origin and evolution of angiosperm flowers due to its basal position in the angiosperm phylogeny. In this study, a subtracted floral cDNA library from floral buds of A. caudigerum was constructed and cDNA arrays by suppression subtractive hybridization were generated. cDNAs of floral buds at different stages before flower opening and of leaves at the seedling stage were used. The macroarray analyses of expression profiles of isolated floral genes showed that 157 genes out of the 612 unique ESTs tested revealed higher transcript abundance in the floral buds and uppermost leaves. Among them, 78 genes were determined to be differentially expressed in the perianth, 62 in the stamens, and 100 genes in the carpels. Quantitative real-time PCR of selected genes validated the macroarray results. Remarkably, APETALA3 (AP3) B-class genes isolated from A. caudigerum were upregulated in the perianth, stamens and carpels, implying that the expression domain of B-class genes in this basal angiosperm was broader than those in their eudicot counterparts.

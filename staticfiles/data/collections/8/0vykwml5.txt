Supramolecular materials composed of proteins and peptides have been receiving considerable attention towards a range of diseases and conditions from vaccines to drug delivery. Owing to the relative newness of this class of materials, the bulk of work to date has been preclinical. However, examples of approved treatments particularly in vaccines, dentistry, and hemostasis are demonstrating the translational potential of supramolecular polypeptides. Here we describe critical milestones in the clinical development of this class of materials and describe currently approved supramolecular polypeptide therapies. Additional examples of not-yet-approved materials that are steadily advancing towards clinical use are also featured. Spherical assemblies such as virus-like particles (VLPs), designed protein nanoparticles, and spherical peptide amphiphiles are highlighted, followed by fiber-forming systems such as fibrillizing peptides, fiber-forming peptide-amphiphiles, and filamentous bacteriophages.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the physician-centered approach of diabetes care in India that is primarily based on routine clinic visits. We aim to review the various aspects of patient-centered care via diabetes self-management education based on available literature. METHODS: This is a narrative review using Pubmed, EMBASE and Google Scholar search till March 29, 2020. Search terms were "COVID-19", "diabetes self-care", "diabetes self-management education", "DSME", "diabetes self-management in India", "diabetes self-care in India" and "DSME in India". RESULTS: We have discussed an educational plan on diabetes self-management that can be adopted for people with diabetes mellitus in our country amid the ongoing pandemic. We have also identified the barriers to diabetes self-management in the current scenario and suggested possible solutions to overcome those. CONCLUSIONS: We have reemphasized the need for a simultaneous patient-centered approach in routine diabetes care that has to be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

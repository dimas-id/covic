This paper presents a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach to support the creation of woven fabrics. Using data from a textile company, two CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) iterations were executed, aiming to compare three input feature representation strategies related with fabric design and finishing processes. During the modeling stage of CRISP-DM, an Automated ML (AutoML) procedure was used to select the best regression model among six distinct state-of-the-art ML algorithms. A total of nine textile physical properties were modeled (e.g., abrasion, elasticity, pilling). Overall, the simpler yarn representation strategy obtained better predictive results. Moreover, for eight fabric properties (e.g., elasticity, pilling) the addition of finishing features improved the quality of the predictions. The best ML models obtained low predictive errors (from 2% to 7%) and are potentially valuable for the textile company, since they can be used to reduce the number of production attempts (saving time and costs).

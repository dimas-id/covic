The advancing field of glycomics is driven by the development of new analysis and synthesis techniques and novel strategies such as metabolic glyco-labeling. In this review we will present strategies for tailoring chemo-enzymatic glycosyltransfer reactions, screening methods such as carbohydrate-based micro-arrays, and metabolic glyco-engineering as a strategy to visualize biological recognition processes for the development of carbohydrate-based vaccines.

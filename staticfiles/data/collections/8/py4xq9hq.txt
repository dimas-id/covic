An internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudoaneurysm associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is rare. We report the first case of unruptured extracranial pseudoaneurysm of the ICA in a patient with NF-1 successfully treated with endovascular stenting and coil embolization.A 66-year-old woman diagnosed with NF-1 had sudden left neck pain and massive swelling 3 years earlier. Radiological examination showed a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the left internal thoracic artery (ITA). The posttreatment computed tomography (CT) scan revealed complete obliteration of the aneurysm of the left ITA and an unruptured pseudoaneurysm of the right ICA. After 3 years of follow-up, a CT scan revealed the enlargement of the pseudoaneurysm of the right extracranial ICA. Endovascular stenting and coil embolization were performed to prevent rupture, and the lesion was completely obliterated. Follow-up angiography at 6 months revealed good flow of the ICA through the stent without any filling of the aneurysm.

Viral hepatitis causes a wide spectrum of presentations from a benign form with minimal or no symptoms to acute liver failure or death. Hepatitis D coinfection and superinfection have distinct clinical courses with the latter more likely leading to chronic infection. Management of chronic HDV is individualized due to the paucity of treatment options and significant side effect profile of currently available treatments. Hepatitis E was once thought to be an infection limited to developing nations with high endemicity, but sporadic cases due to contaminated meats is becoming increasingly prevalent in immunocompromised hosts. Human herpes viruses are an important cause of disease also in the immunocompromised individual.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, with an annual incidence ranking from 1.6 to 10.6 per 1.000 people in Europe. The incidence is age related, peaking over 65 years. Up to 75 % of CAP patients with pulmonary diseases need hospitalization, and up to a 10 % of these are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to complications like sepsis, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1â€“3]. Up to 8 % of CAP patients die within 90 days of disease onset; 21 % die within a year [4] making CAP the most frequent cause of death from infection in Europe and the third most common cause of death in general [5]. Mortality is highest in ICU patients.

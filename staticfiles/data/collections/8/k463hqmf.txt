In recent months the world has been surprised by the rapid advance of COVID-19. In order to face this disease and minimize its socio-economic impacts, in addition to surveillance and treatment, diagnosis is a crucial procedure. However, the realization of this is hampered by the delay and the limited access to laboratory tests, demanding new strategies to carry out case triage. In this scenario, deep learning models are being proposed as a possible option to assist the diagnostic process based on chest X-ray and computed tomography images. Therefore, this research aims to automate the process of detecting COVID-19 cases from chest images, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) through deep learning techniques. The results can contribute to expand access to other forms of detection of COVID-19 and to speed up the process of identifying this disease. All databases used, the codes built, and the results obtained from the models' training are available for open access. This action facilitates the involvement of other researchers in enhancing these models since this can contribute to the improvement of results and, consequently, the progress in confronting COVID-19.

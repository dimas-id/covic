BACKGROUND Preliminary results of a new bariatric surgery program in a VA Medical Center using laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS Prospective review of the first 50 patients who underwent LSG. Percentage change in body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profiles, and medications were recorded. RESULTS Mean age was 52 years. Average BMI was 46 kg/m(2). There were no mortalities or staple line leaks. The percentage excess BMI loss was 47% and 54% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. After 6 months, fasting glucose level decreased from 127 to 93 mg/dL, and mean glycosylated hemoglobin decreased from 6.8% to 5.7%. At 1-year follow-up evaluation, serum cholesterol decreased from 182 to 168 mg/dL, mean triglycerides from 179 to 93 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein from 110 to 94 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein increased from 42 to 50 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is safe and effective for morbidly obese VA patients and resulted in significant discontinuation of medication for hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

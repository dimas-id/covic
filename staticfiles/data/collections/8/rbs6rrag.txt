A management system designed to control diarrhea in newborn beef calves has been outlined. The calving herd is moved from the wintering grounds to previously prepared, comfortable calving grounds. The herd is divided into small subunits for surveillance of calving. The calving areas should be well-bedded, and a natural or artificial windbreak should be provided. All parts of the calving grounds should be readily accessible. Every effort is made to ensure that calves receive a liberal supply of colostrum within hours after birth. Obstetrical assistance is provided as necessary to ensure that all calves are born vigorous. At 24 hours of age, the cow-calf pair is moved out of the calving grounds to the nursery pasture. Diarrheic calves are moved to an isolation area and treated accordingly. The system is successful because the newborn calf is moved from contaminated areas of high population density to areas of lower population density that are less contaminated with the common enteropathogens. Under certain circumstances, the vaccination of the dam in late pregnancy with E. coli K99+ bacterins may be beneficial as an aid to the control of the disease.

SARS-CoV-2 is spreading globally at a rapid pace. To contain its spread and prevent further fatalities, the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent prerequisite. Thus, in this article, by utilizing the in silico approach, a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed. Moreover, the effectiveness and safety measures of our proposed epitopic vaccine candidate have been evaluated by in silico tools and servers (AllerTOP and AllergenFP servers). We observed that the vaccine candidate has no allergenicity and successfully combined with Toll-like receptor (TLR) protein to elicit an inflammatory immune response. Stable, functional mobility of the vaccine-TLR protein binding interface was confirmed by the Normal Mode Analysis. The in silico cloning model demonstrated the efficacy of the construct vaccine along with the identified epitopes against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our proposed in silico vaccine candidate has potent efficacy against COVID-19 infection, and successive research work might validate its effectiveness in in vitro and in vivo models.

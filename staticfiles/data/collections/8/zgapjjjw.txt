We conducted a preliminary comparison of the relative sensitivity of a cross-section of published human rhinovirus (HRV)â€“specific PCR primer pairs, varying the oligonucleotides and annealing temperature. None of the pairs could detect all HRVs in 2 panels of genotyped clinical specimens; >1 PCR is required for accurate description of HRV epidemiology.

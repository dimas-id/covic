Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is usually the cause of mild gastroenteritis in dogs and is known to have spread worldwide. However, to date, no CCoV cases have been confirmed in Greece. In the present work, the authors investigated an outbreak of enteritis in puppies from a Greek kennel for the presence of CCoV. Dogs were presented with clinical signs of diarrhea, anorexia, weakness, depression, dehydration, and 1 death. Canine coronavirus type II was detected by reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction in all 11 puppies, whereas 1 puppy presented dual infection with CCoV type II and canine parvovirus 2. Surprisingly, sequence analysis of the samples revealed higher similarity to the pantropic CCoV II strain CB/05 than to other reference strains, in the most variable region of the S gene.

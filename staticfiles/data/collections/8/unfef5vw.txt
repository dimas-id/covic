Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and correct practices are crucial for the prevention of COVID-19. Aims This study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of a sample of Sudanese residents towards COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted on 812 participants, including both sexes and aged 18 years and above, with the exclusion of health care workers. Considerable care was taken to include people with different education levels. Results Among the survey respondents (n=812), 45.8% were women, 40.4% held a bachelor's degree, 5.7% were uneducated, and 51.1% were aged 18-25 years. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 78.2%; 66.9% agreed that religious gatherings and events should be cancelled to prevent the spread of COVID-19; 34.1% of respondents wore medical masks; and 57.9% avoided shaking hands in recent days. Conclusion This study showed that sampled Sudanese residents have incomplete knowledge and poor practices towards COVID-19. However, we found that women and people aged 18-25 years were more knowledgeable and had more positive attitudes towards COVID-19. We hope that concerned authorities will establish awareness programmes to improve the ability to combat this disease.

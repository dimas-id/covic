Various surgical techniques, such as endoscopic surgery and robotic surgery, are developed to optimize the esthetic outcome even in operations for malignancy. A modified face-lift or retroauricular approach are used to minimize postoperative scarring. Recently, robot-assisted surgery is being done in various fields and considered as favorable treatment method by many surgeons. However its high cost is a nonnegligible fraction for many patients. On the other hand, endoscopic surgery, which is cheaper than robotic surgery, is minimally invasive with contentable neck dissection. Although it is a difficult technique for a beginner surgeon due to its limited operation view, we suppose it as an alternative method for robotic surgery. Herein, we report two cases of endoscopic neck dissection via retroauricular incision with a discussion regarding the pros and cons of endoscopic neck dissection.

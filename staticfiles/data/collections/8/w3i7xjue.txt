Gastrointestinal tract involvement is a rare complication of plasma cell neoplasia. We present a case of non‐secretory type primary plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) with multiple gastric involvement. Dual surface antigen analysis of bone marrow cells revealed that atypical plasma cells coexpressed CD38 and myeloid antigen CD13. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy disclosed multiple submucosal masses in the body of the stomach. Endoscopic biopsy specimens showed marked infiltration of atypical plasma cells consistent with a diagnosis of gastric involvement by PCL. Since CD13 antigen is identical to aminopeptidase N, a membrane‐bound glycoprotein thought to be involved in the process of tumour invasion, CD13 expression on neoplastic plasma cells may be related to the gastric involvement in this patient.

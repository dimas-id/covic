Innovation in technology is redefining the world, including health care. Patients want convenient and quality interactions with their providers. The addition of telemedicine technologies and asynchronous provider-to-patient communications is creating a more connected model of health care that will improve access and the value of care while decreasing costs, as well as enabling patients to participate more directly in their own care. As new technologies and new models of care continue to emerge, providers need to continue to monitor the rapidly changing landscape of telemedicine coding and reimbursement. Telehealth coding and reimbursement rules are payor and state dependent.

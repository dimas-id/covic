In the age of extensive global traffic systems, the close neighborhood of man and livestock in some regions of the world, as well as inadequate prevention measures and medical care in poorer countries, greatly facilitates the emergence and dissemination of new virus strains. The appearance of avian influenza viruses that can infect humans, the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and the unprecedented raging of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) illustrate the threat of a global virus pandemic. In addition, viruses like hepatitis B and C claim more than one million lives every year for want of efficient therapy. Thus, new approaches to prevent virus propagation are urgently needed. Antisense strategies are considered a very attractive means of inhibiting viral replication, as oligonucleotides can be designed to interact with any viral RNA, provided its sequence is known. The ensuing targeted destruction of viral RNA should interfere with viral replication without entailing negative effects on ongoing cellular processes. In this review, we will give some examples of the employment of antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, and RNA interference strategies for antiviral purposes. Currently, in spite of encouraging results in preclinical studies, only a few antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes have turned out to be efficient antiviral compounds in clinical trials. The advent of RNA interference now seems to be refueling hopes for decisive progress in the field of therapeutic employment of antisense strategies.

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic there is a need for a rapid increase in intensive care and ventilation capacities. Delivery times for additional intensive care respirators are currently not foreseeable. An option to increase ventilation capacities not only for COVID-19, but for all patients requiring mechanical ventilation is to use home respirators. Home respirators are turbine respirators, so they can usually be operated without high-pressure oxygen connections and can therefore also be used in areas outside the classical intensive care medical infrastructure. Due to their limited technical features, home respirators are not suitable for the treatment of severely affected patients but can be used for weaning after respiratory improvement, which means that intensive care respirators are available again more quickly. Respiratory therapists are specially trained nurses or therapists in the field of out of hospital ventilation and can independently use home ventilation respirators, for example for weaning in the intensive care unit. Thus, they relieve intensive care nursing staff in the pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic medical students from the Oldenburg University are currently being trained in operating home respirators to provide basic support in the hospital if necessary.

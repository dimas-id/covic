BACKGROUND: Fidelity of DNA polymerases can be influenced by cation co-factors. Physiologically, Mg(2+) is used as a co-factor by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+) can also support catalysis. Although Zn(2+) supports DNA synthesis, it inhibits HIV RT by significantly modifying RT catalysis. Zn(2+) is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against HIV and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of RT with Zn(2+). METHODS: We used PCR-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of RT with Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Zn(2+). RESULTS: The fidelity of DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT was approximately 2.5 fold greater in Zn(2+) when compared to Mg(2+) at cation conditions optimized for nucleotide catalysis. Consistent with this, RT extended primers with mismatched 3â€² nucleotides poorly and inserted incorrect nucleotides less efficiently using Zn(2+) than Mg(2+). In agreement with previous literature, we observed that Mn(2+) and Co(2+) dramatically decreased the fidelity of RT at highly elevated concentrations (6 mM). However, surprisingly, the fidelity of HIV RT with Mn(2+) and Co(2+) remained similar to Mg(2+) at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis. CONCLUSION: This study shows that Zn(2+), at optimal extension conditions, increases the fidelity of HIV-1 RT and challenges the notion that alternative cations capable of supporting polymerase catalysis are inherently mutagenic.

INTRODUCTION In Asia, long-term weight loss results of gastric banding have been unsatisfactory. Bands are associated with higher complication rates, which result in a high reoperation rate. The aim of this paper is to discuss the choice of revisional procedure, operative technique and evaluate the postoperative complication rates. METHODS Between January 2007 and January 2010, we operated on 41 patients who were included retrospectively in this series. The most common reason for band removal was failure to lose adequate weight. Of those patients, 40 underwent band removal and conversion to a revisional bariatric surgery concomitantly; one patient's procedure was deferred to a later date. LSG was performed in 26 and LRYGB in 15. The highlights of the operative technique were meticulous dissection, complete removal of the pseudocapsule, choosing the right stapler cartridge, oversewing and inverting the entire staple line, and complete dissection of the left crus and pars flaccid. RESULT The median duration of surgery was 85 min (range, 55-180 min). There was no conversion to open surgery. The median stay in the hospital was 4 d (range, 2-7 d). There were no leaks or any other major complications in the postoperative period. CONCLUSION Concomitant revisional procedure after removal of gastric band is safe and feasible. The operative technique followed at our center has had an extremely low postoperative morbidity rate and a 0% leak rate.

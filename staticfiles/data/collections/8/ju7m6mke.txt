PURPOSE This study investigated the staff nurses' perception of the infection prevention climate and its predictors in two hospitals. DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study employing a convenience sample of 224 staff nurses at two general hospitals in Riyadh province. METHODS The study utilized a two-part questionnaire that captures respondents' characteristics and the validated tool on Leading a Culture of Quality for Infection Prevention (LCQ-IP). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized accordingly. RESULTS The prioritization of quality received the highest mean score among the four factors of the scale (mean = 3.89, SD = 0.65), followed by supportive work environment (mean = 3.88, SD = 0.68), psychological safety (mean = 3.85, SD = 0.65), and improvement orientation (mean = 3.84, SD = 0.64). Nationality, clinical experience, and attendance to seminars or training were identified as significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS The respondents perceived the infection prevention climate of the two general hospitals positively. This study strengthens the idea that organizational context influences negatively or positively the programs on infection prevention being implemented in the hospitals. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The result may facilitate nursing and hospital management to reflect, examine, and review their organizational climate, the impact of infection prevention initiatives and patient safety strategies, and the reason to amend related policies or improve procedures, including the promotion of a healthy work environment.

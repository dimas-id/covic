INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 epidemic has led to the need for unprecedented decisions to be made to maintain the provision of neurological care. This article addresses operational decision-making during the epidemic. DEVELOPMENT: We report the measures taken, including the preparation of a functional reorganisation plan, strategies for hospitalisation and emergency management, the use of telephone consultations to maintain neurological care, provision of care at a unit outside the hospital for priority patients, decisions about complementary testing and periodic in-hospital treatments, and the use of a specific telephone service to prioritise patients with epileptic seizures. CONCLUSION: Despite the situation of confinement, neurology departments must continue to provide patient care through different means of operation. Like all elements of management, these must be evaluated.

Dihydropyrimidines are the most important heterocyclic ring systems which play an important role in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. Synthetically they were synthesized using Multi-component reactions like Biginelli reaction and Hantzschdihydropyridine. In the past decades, such Biginelli type dihydropyrimidones have received a considerable amount of attention due to the interesting pharmacological properties associated with this heterocyclic scaffold. In this review, we highlight recent developments in this area, with a focus on the DHPMs, recently developed as anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, anti-tubercular, antifungal anticancer, antibacterial, antifilarial, antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, analgesic, anti-convulsant, antioxidant, anti-TRPA1, anti-SARS, and anti-cancer activity and Î±(1a) binding affinity.

The sudden appearance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 demonstrated to the world at large that despite the high standard of medical care in affected countries, a highly contagious emerging infectious disease could spread rapidly worldwide. By application and improvement of stringent infection control measures, a further spread of SARS could be stopped and the disease could so far be defeated. In the meantime, decisive progress in the knowledge about the structure and further characteristics of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been made, including the likely virus reservoir and the ways of spread. Validated diagnostic tests are now available and are further being improved. Effective vaccines and antiviral agents are being developed. Of imminent importance to prepare against a resurgence of SARS, remain, besides an exact knowledge about the viral pathogen and its possible further behavior, constant vigilance, early recognition, and instant isolation of suspected cases of SARS.

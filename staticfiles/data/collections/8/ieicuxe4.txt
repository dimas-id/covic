Polyoxometalates (POMs) are interesting biomedical agents due to their versatile anticancer and antiviral properties, such as remarkable anti-HIV activity. Although POMs are tunable and easily accessible inorganic drug prototypes in principle, their full potential can only be tapped by enhancing their biocompatibility, for example, through organic functionalization. We have therefore investigated the HIV-1 protease inhibition potential of functionalized Keggin- and Dawson-type POMs with organic side chains. Their inhibitory performance was furthermore compared to other POM types, and the buffer dependence of the results is discussed. In addition, chemical shift mapping NMR experiments were performed to exclude POMâ€“substrate interactions. Whereas the introduction of organic side chains into POMs is a promising approach in principle, the influence of secondary effects on the reaction system also merits detailed investigation.

The global outbreak of COVID‐19 has required mental health providers to rapidly rethink and how they provide care. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a trauma‐focused, evidence‐based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder that is effective when delivered in‐person or via telehealth. Given current limitations on the provision of in‐person mental health treatment during the COVID‐19 pandemic, this article presents guidelines and treatment considerations when implementing CPT via telehealth. Based on lessons learned from prior studies and clinical delivery of CPT via telehealth, recommendations are made with regard to overall strategies for adapting CPT to a telehealth format, including how to conduct routine assessments and ensure treatment fidelity.

The COVID-19 pandemic and antimicrobial resistance are parallel and interacting health emergencies with opportunity for mutual learning. As their measures and consequences are comparable, the COVID-19 pandemic helps to illustrate the potential long-term impact of AMR, which is less acute but not less crucial. They may also impact each other as there is a push to resort to existing antimicrobials in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the absence of specific treatments, while attempts to manage the spread of COVID-19 may also lead to a slow down AMR. Understanding how COVID-19 affects AMR trends and what we can expect if these remain the same or worsen, will help us plan next steps to tackle AMR. Researchers should now start collecting data to measure the impact of current COVID-19 policies and programs on AMR.

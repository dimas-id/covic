PURPOSE OF REVIEW The world's population is becoming increasing mobile. Each mobile population (e.g. immigrants, refugees, travelers) has certain characteristics that determine public health risk and infectious disease burden. Refugees present unique challenges to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. RECENT FINDINGS Refugee migration to the United States represents the most controlled population movement between countries from a health perspective. Medical screening and programs that provide presumptive treatment for highly prevalent infectious diseases both prior to and after migration alter the infectious disease epidemiology in these populations. SUMMARY Infectious disease specialists must recognize that different characteristics of distinct mobile populations will alter infectious disease burden. This article specifically highlights how recent public health approaches have altered the epidemiology and clinical presentation of malaria, intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in refugee populations.

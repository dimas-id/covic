Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage[DAH] is a serious condition that can be life threatening. It can be caused by a constellation of disorders which presents with hemoptysis, anemia, and diffuse alveolar infiltrates. Respiratory failure from DAH can be so severe that it has been called an ARDS mimic/imitator. Early recognition is crucial because prompt diagnosis and treatment are required for survival. DAH should be distinguished from other causes of pulmonary hemorrhage caused by localized pulmonary abnormalities and the bronchial circulation. Early bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is generally required to confirm the diagnosis of DAH and rule out infection. Progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples can distinguish DAH. Systemic vasculitis is one of the most common causes of DAH and can be pathologically defined by the presence of cellular inflammation, vessel destruction, tissue necrosis, and eventually, organ dysfunction. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents remain the gold standard for the treatment. The following case illustrates a patient who was dependent on dialysis, then presented with hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy demonstrated progressively bloody bronchoalveolar lavage samples consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Serologic testing was consistent with microscopic polyangiitis. The patient experienced a clinical remission with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids.

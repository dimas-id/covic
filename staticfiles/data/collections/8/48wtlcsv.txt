A matched case control study was performed to describe the epidemiological features of potential enteric pathogens for calves reared in 53 cow-calf herds located in western Switzerland. A total of 106 diarrhoeic calves and 126 healthy control calves were collected, all calves were less than 4 months old. Faecal samples were analysed for presence of infectious agents related to calf diarrhoea including enterotoxigenic E. coli, Verotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC), Campylobacter sp., Yersinia sp., Salmonella sp., rotavirus, coronavirus, helminths and coccidian protozoa. Multivariate logistic models were used to analyse the relationship between presence of infection and onset of diarrhoea. The study provided evidence of significant associations between diarrhoea and infection with rotavirus, Campylobacter coli and the presence of Verotoxin in faecal samples. With the exception of Cryptosporidium parvum intestinal parasites including Strongylidae and Eimeria sp. were found to be less prevalent in cases than in controls. Control calves were significantly more frequently infected with Strongyloides papillosus than case animals.

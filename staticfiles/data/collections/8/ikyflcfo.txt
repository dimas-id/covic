To evaluate the efficacy of intracerebral (IC) immunization, mice were immunized with a rabies vaccine by the subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM) or IC route, and 10-fold the 50% lethal dose of rabies virus was inoculated into the hindleg of the immunized or non-immunized mice. The antibody titer in serum was elevated and boosted by additional immunization via all routes, but highest after the IC immunization followed by the IM and SC routes, in this order. Intracerebrally immunized mice were completely protected from death and the neurological signs of infection, whereas the IM or SC immunization only partly protected the mice. In mouse models, IC immunization is more effective at inducing a protective immune response against the transneural spread of rabies virus than IM or SC immunization.

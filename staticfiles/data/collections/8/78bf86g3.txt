The global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, has dramatically transformed all aspects of our daily lives The continually evolving understanding of the disease process and uncertainty regarding the availability of vital resources have created an unprecedented challenge, matched in magnitude by concerns for the well-being of our patients, families, colleagues, and communities Our global craniomaxillofacial (CMF) community has met this challenge head on, whether providing care for acute injuries or aggressive pathology, performing modified duties in support of our frontline medical colleagues, assisting in the development of triage and care plans, supporting public health responses, or assisting friends and neighbors in this austere climate Public health measures for containing the spread of disease (social distancing) and to optimize the allocation of limited resources, such as personal protective equipment, have now been widely adopted and there is hope that they will be effective Similarly, principles for the safe practice of craniomaxillofacial surgery during this crisis cannot be overemphasized The AO CMF International Task Force has developed guidelines to support surgeons caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic 1 These recommendations trace their evolution to expert opinions and guidelines set forth by a number of national and international societies, as well as the limited, but increasing, available data in the peer-reviewed medical literature The complete report from the Task Force is available online, and we strongly encourage you to review this document, if you have not already had an opportunity to do so 1

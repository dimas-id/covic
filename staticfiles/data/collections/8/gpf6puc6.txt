INTRODUCTION Infundibula are symmetrical funnel-shaped widening, measuring more than 3 mm at its base with the branch artery arising from its apex. The pathological significance of this entity remains controversial. Although a relatively common appearance in otherwise normal angiograms, they have occasionally been described to progress into saccular aneurysms or directly rupture. METHODS/RESULTS We describe the first case of a disappearing infundibulum after a flow diverting stent was deployed across the infundibulum during the treatment of an adjacent aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS We concur in the view that infundibula are at least pre-pathological lesions that may in certain circumstances require consideration for treatment. Our case for the first time offers a potential treatment option for such situations.

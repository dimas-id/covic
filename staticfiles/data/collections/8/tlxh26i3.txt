The cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) has emerged as an important experimental animal model for biomedical research in various domains, necessitating the more extensive characterization of the genetic backgrounds influencing the macaque's response to drugs and sensitivity to experimental disease. The diversity of the variable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region has been analyzed phylogenetically among geographically isolated populations or within subdivisions of the same regional population. However, the genetic differences among several substructures originating from a common population have not yet been investigated. By sequencing fragments of the mtDNA D-loop region from two subpopulations from the Indochinese region (Cambodian-Chinese and Vietnamese) along with two native Indonesian and Filipino populations, we identified 87 mtDNA D-loop haplotypes, of which 67 are new. The phylogenetic relationship suggests that the Indochinese haplotypes are intermingled in comparison to the distinct divergence of the Indonesian and Filipino lineages. The subpopulations were shown by estimation of evolutionary divergence and Wright's F-statistic (Fst) to have little genetic differentiation. Altogether, the subpopulations may be used in biomedical research, even though a slight difference is observed in haplotype frequencies among them. Therefore, genetic diversity analyses will be necessary for the elucidation of genetic differences among the populations, as well as to obtain a better understanding of genetic diversity for biomedical research. This will involve the selection of macaques and the monitoring of genetic heterogeneity among and within breeding facilities.

With the advances in computational resources, there is an increasing urge among the computational researchers to make the in silico approaches fast, convenient, reproducible, acceptable, and sensible ones. Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand–receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds. VS serves as an efficient computational tool that integrates structural data with lead optimization as a cost-effective approach to drug discovery.

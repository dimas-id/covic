Pulmonary sequestration (PS) is a rare congenital malformation of the respiratory tract. Two main variants are described, the intralobar and the extralobar PS. Clinical manifestations vary from accidental findings to life threatening complications. Surgical resection is the definitive and indicated treatment of PS. The operation could be performed through an open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery approach. We report the management of two patients with diagnosis of extralobar PS in the first case and intralobar PS in the second case. Both patients underwent uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery resection of PS with success. In our experience, we confirm that uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery is a safe and feasible approach for extralobar and intralobar PS.

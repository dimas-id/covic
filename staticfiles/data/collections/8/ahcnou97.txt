The Trellis thrombectomy system (Covidien) has been used successfully to perform isolated pharmacomechanical thrombectomy of both venous and arterial thrombi. The device is designed to provide localized treatment while preventing both systemic spread of the thrombolytic agent and also distal embolization. However, when this device is utilized to remove thrombi at bifurcation lesions, embolization into the contralateral vessel can potentially occur. We describe a novel and simple technique of adjunctive kissing balloon inflation while using the Trellis device for the management of an aortoiliac occlusion that occurred in one of two juxtaposed stents previously placed in the distal aorta into the bilateral iliac arteries. This technique prevented distal embolization into the contralateral iliac artery.

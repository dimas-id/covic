BACKGROUND Diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection after total joint arthroplasty is often challenging. The alpha defensin test has been recently reported as a promising diagnostic test for periprosthetic joint infection. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of alpha defensin testing. METHODS One hundred and eighty-three synovial alpha defensin and synovial fluid C-reactive protein (CRP) tests performed in 183 patients undergoing evaluation for periprosthetic joint infection were reviewed. Results were compared with the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria for periprosthetic joint infection. RESULTS Alpha defensin tests were performed prior to surgical treatment for infection, and 37 of these patients who had these tests were diagnosed by MSIS criteria as having infections. Among this group, the alpha defensin test had a sensitivity of 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.8% to 92.0%) and a specificity of 95.9% (95% CI, 91.3% to 98.5%). There were 6 false-positive results, 4 of which were associated with metallosis. There were 7 false negatives, all of which were associated with either draining sinuses (n = 3) or low-virulence organisms (n = 4). A combined analysis of alpha defensin and synovial fluid CRP tests was performed in which a positive result was represented by a positive alpha defensin test and a positive synovial fluid CRP test (n = 28). Among this group, the sensitivity was calculated to be 73.0% (95% CI, 55.9% to 86.2%) and the specificity was calculated to be 99.3% (95% CI, 96.2% to 99.9%). An additional combined analysis was performed where a positive result was represented by a positive alpha defensin test or positive synovial fluid CRP test (n = 64). Among this group, the sensitivity was calculated to be 91.9% (95% CI, 78.1% to 98.3%) and the specificity was calculated to be 79.5% (95% CI, 72.0% to 85.7%). CONCLUSIONS Alpha defensin in combination with synovial fluid CRP demonstrates very high sensitivity for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection, but may yield false-positive results in the presence of metallosis or false-negative results in the presence of low-virulence organisms. When both alpha defensin and synovial fluid CRP tests are positive, there is a very high specificity for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level III.

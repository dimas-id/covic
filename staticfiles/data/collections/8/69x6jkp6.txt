PURPOSE Although perioperative hypothermia may increase maternal morbidity, active warming is infrequently performed to maintain normothermia during Cesarean delivery (CD). The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the factors associated with maternal hypothermia in this setting. METHODS Women scheduled for elective or emergency CD were consecutively included in this study from November 2014 to October 2015. Maternal temperature was measured using an infrared tympanic thermometer on the patient's arrival in the operating room, at skin incision, and at the end of skin suture. Maternal hypothermia was defined by tympanic temperature < 36°C at the end of skin suture. Univariate analysis was performed, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, in order to determine the factors associated with maternal hypothermia at the end of the surgery. RESULTS Three hundred fifty-nine women were included and analyzed during this study. The incidence of hypothermia was 23% (95% confidence interval, 18 to 27) among the total population included. According to multivariate analysis, obesity, oxytocin augmentation of labour, and use of active forced-air warming were associated with a decreased risk of maternal hypothermia, while maternal temperature < 37.1°C on arrival in the operating room, maternal temperature < 36.6°C at skin incision, and an infused volume of fluids > 650 mL were significantly associated with maternal hypothermia. Both goodness of fit and predictive value of multivariate analysis were high. CONCLUSION Several predictive factors for maternal hypothermia during CD were identified. These factors should be taken into account to help prevent maternal hypothermia during CD.

Respiratory volume monitoring (RVM) has been developed to noninvasively measure minute ventilation (VÌ‡E), tidal volume, and breathing frequency and to display real-time respiratory curves in nonintubated patients. Although RVM was originally developed for post-anesthesia and monitored anesthesia care, we describe 3 applications for this monitor in an otherwise austere setting at a missionary hospital in Kijabe, Kenya. Applications of RVM can be utilized in any ICU in a developing or developed country.

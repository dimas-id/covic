In this age of rapid globalization and travel, diseases that were previously prevalent in warmer countries within the tropics are increasingly found in other countries with more temperate climates. A sound knowledge of such “tropical” renal diseases is essential for the practicing general pediatrician or nephrologist. This chapter describes tropical renal diseases as broadly divided into “infectious” conditions such as malaria, rickettsial infections, and viral hemorrhagic fevers, among others, and “toxic” conditions including snakebite and use of indigenous medicines which result in renal injury. In general, severe and progressive renal damage is preventable with early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition and provision of supportive care.

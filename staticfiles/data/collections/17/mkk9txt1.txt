Influenza A viruses (IAVs) occasionally cross the species barrier and adapt to novel host species. This requires readjustment of the functional balance of the sialic acid receptor-binding hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-destroying neuraminidase (NA) to the sialoglycan-receptor repertoire of the new host. Novel techniques have revealed mechanistic details of this HA–NA–receptor balance, emphasizing a previously underappreciated crucial role for NA in driving the motility of receptor-associated IAV particles. Motility enables virion penetration of the sialylated mucus layer as well as attachment to, and uptake into, underlying epithelial cells. As IAVs are essentially irreversibly bound in the absence of NA activity, the fine-tuning of the HA–NA–receptor balance rather than the binding avidity of IAV particles per se is an important factor in determining host species tropism.

A stochastic susceptible–infectious–recovered epidemic model with temporary immunity and media coverage is proposed. The effects of Lévy jumps on the dynamics of the model are considered. A unique global positive solution for the epidemic model is obtained. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee that the epidemic disease is extinct and persistent in the mean. The threshold behavior is discussed. Numerical simulations are given to verify our theoretical results.

Rhinoviral infections belong to the most frequent human infections characterized by common cold, chronic bronchitis, exacerbations of asthma, otitis media and sinusitis. Here, we define molecular mechanisms that mediate infections of human epithelial cells with human rhinovirus strain 14 (RV14). We demonstrate that RV14 activates p38-MAPKinase (p38-K) in a biphasic time course. Early stimulation of p38-K by RV14 was observed a few minutes after initiation of the infection, while the late increase of p38-K activity occurred 7-12 hrs upon infection. The stimulation of p38-K was mediated by the small G-protein RhoA,which was activated by RV14. Transfection of a genetic construct preventing RhoA activation blocked RV14-induced p38-K activation. Further, integrity of cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains was required for RV14-mediated p38-K activation, which was inhibited by destruction of membrane rafts. The data indicate that RV employs a signaling cascade from membrane rafts via the small G-protein RhoA to p38-K to infect human cells.

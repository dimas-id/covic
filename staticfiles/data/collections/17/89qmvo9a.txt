In December, 2019, an infection outbreak occurred in Wuhan of unknown cause, which attracts intense attention. Shortly after the virus was identified with the name of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out and an information storm occurred. At that time, two important aspects: the stage and the links of epidemic, were unclear. Answers to the questions, what are the sources, how do infections occur, and who will be affected should be clarified as the outbreak continues to evolve. Furthermore, the epidemic process and the stage of epidemic should be explored and discussed. Based on information of SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome(MERS) and COVID-19, the links of epidemic (the sources, the routes of infection, and the susceptible population) will be discussed as well as the role of the natural and the social factors. Epidemiology characteristics of patients will be traced based on current information.

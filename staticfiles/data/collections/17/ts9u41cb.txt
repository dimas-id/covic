A 25-year-old female yellow-naped Amazon parrot ( Amazona auropalliata) was presented for an acute onset of lethargy, ptyalism, and regurgitation. Results of hematologic testing and plasma biochemical analysis revealed severe leukopenia and heteropenia with toxic heterophils and marked hyperamylasemia and hypoproteinemia, consistent with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Survey radiograph findings were suggestive of coelomic effusion. Results of a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a tubular, irregularly marginated structure along the medial aspect of the duodenum, consistent with an inflamed pancreas. The bird died soon after CT imaging, and acute necrotizing pancreatitis and pancreatic coagulative necrosis were observed at necropsy. This report describes the use of a less-invasive modality such as CT to aid in the antemortem diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in a psittacine bird. Pancreatitis should be considered a differential diagnosis in birds with gastrointestinal signs and coelomic effusion visualized on radiography, and the observation of an enlarged inflamed pancreas in the absence of a defined pancreatic mass on CT.

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new Coronavirus, with first reported human infections in late 2019. COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 have not been completely understood yet. More than 200000 persons were killed during this epidemic (till 1 May 2020). Therefore, developing forecasting models to predict the spread of that epidemic is a critical issue. In this study, statistical and artificial intelligence based approaches have been proposed to model and forecast the prevalence of this epidemic in Egypt. These approaches are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). The official data reported by The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population of COVID-19 cases in the period between 1 March and 1 May, 2020 was used to train the models. The forecasted cases showed a good agreement with officially reported cases. The obtained results of this study may help the Egyptian decision-makers to put short-term future plans to face this epidemic.

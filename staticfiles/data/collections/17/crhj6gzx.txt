SUMMARY The features of naturally occurring Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype III infections in 16 sheep, one goat and 3 pigs, and Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I infections in 3 goats, are described. Affected animals usually had diarrhoea and were in poor condition or emaciated. A number were moribund or dead when submitted for necropsy. Thickening of the caecal and colonic mucosa was the only gross lesion attributable to Y. pseudotuberculosis infection, with liver or other visceral abscesses not being seen. Characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 10 sheep, one goat and one pig infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III and one goat infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I. Sheep, goats and pigs dosed orally with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III, the serotype isolated most commonly from these species, developed intestinal infection. In sheep and pigs, infection was accompanied by diarrhoea. Haematological changes and specific antibodies were elicited in all 3 species in response to infection. Microabscesses were seen in the intestinal mucosa of all experimentally exposed animals. The occurrence of field cases and the results of experimental exposure confirm that Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III is an enteropathogen of sheep, goats and pigs. The association of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I with lesions in a goat, indicates that this bacterium may also be a pathogen of this species. It is concluded that Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III is an enteric pathogen of a wide range of ungulate species including cattle, buffalo, deer, antelopes, sheep, goats and pigs. Serotypes I and II, while having a more restricted host range, are probably also pathogens of ungulates and, in particular, deer, antelopes and goats.

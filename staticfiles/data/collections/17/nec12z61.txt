Pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) is a novel virus that causes severe pneumonia. Elderly people with co-morbidities are at risk of severe disease. Symptoms are generally milder in children. We present an asthmatic 12-year old girl with cough, wheeze, and mild pneumonia due to COVID-19. Reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19 on nasopharyngeal sample. Chest radiograph revealed bronchopneumonia. Frequent salbutamol inhalers were administered for treatment. Case was discharged home 2 days following hospitalization. COVID-19 may present with mild pneumonia in children or with an exacerbation of asthma in asthmatic children. Additional observations of clinical presentations of COVID-19 in children are recommended.

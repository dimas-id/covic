COVID‐19 is the latest global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). There have been seven pathogenic Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs) which cause respiratory infections. Common cold coronaviruses HCoV‐229E, HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐NL63, HCoV‐HKU1 are the four endemic HCoVs. SARS‐CoV‐1, MERS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV‐2 are zoonotic emerging epidemic pathogens with significant morbidity, mortality and economic impact. The endemic HCoVs have been known to cause co‐infections or can be co‐detected with each other or with other respiratory viruses. In general, respiratory viral co‐infections are recognized more commonly today with the use of respiratory multiplex molecular diagnostic panels. Clinicians need to be aware of co‐infections among HCoVs. A high degree of suspicion in this rapidly evolving outbreak is required in order to make the diagnosis. This is vital if we are to try and contain and control the spread of the COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The etiology of abomasal ulcers/tympany was investigated in 48 animals from 36 ranches in Wyoming and Nebraska. Results indicate that subclinical trace mineral deficiencies of copper and/or selenium exist in the range cattle in west central Nebraska and Wyoming. Etiological agents most frequently incriminated by bacteriologic cultures and/or histopathic examination were Clostridium perfringens and Campylobacter species. Histopathologic evaluation of abomasums revealed 31 of 38 cases contained abundant gram-positive bacteria associated with the damaged abomasal mucosa. Campylobacter-like organisms were demonstrated in 9 of 38 cases using the modified Dieterle stain. Clostridium perfringens was isolated in 14 of 38 cases, and Campylobacter jejuni was recovered from 5 of 38 cases.

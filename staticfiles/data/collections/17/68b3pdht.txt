We present a practical proof search procedure for Coq based on a direct search for type inhabitants in an appropriate normal form. The procedure is more general than any of the automation tactics natively available in Coq. It aims to handle as large a part of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions as practically feasible. For efficiency, our procedure is not complete for the entire Calculus of Inductive Constructions, but we prove completeness for a first-order fragment. Even in pure intuitionistic first-order logic, our procedure performs competitively. We implemented the procedure in a Coq plugin and evaluated it on a collection of Coq libraries, on CompCert, and on the ILTP library of first-order intuitionistic problems. The results are promising and indicate the viablility of our approach to general automated proof search for the Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

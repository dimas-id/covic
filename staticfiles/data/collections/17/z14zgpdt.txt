Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota was selected as a bacterial carrier for the development of live mucosal vaccines against coronavirus. A 75 kDa fragment of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) spike glycoprotein S was used as the model coronavirus antigen. The S glycoprotein was cloned into a Lactobacillus/E. coli shuttle vector (pLP500) where expression and secretion of the glycoprotein S from the recombinant lactobacilli was detected via immunoblotting. Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant LcS that constitutively expresses the 75 kDa fragment of the glycoprotein S, induced both local mucosal and systemic immune responses against TGEV. Maximum titers of IgG (8.38 ± 0.19 ng/ml of serum) and IgA (64.82 ± 2.9 ng/ml of intestinal water) were attained 32 days post oral inturbation. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on TGEV infection.

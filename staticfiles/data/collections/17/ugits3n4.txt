This paper presents a Python library to simulate different kinds of quantum finite automata on a classical computer. The library also provides tools for language generation and visual representation of simulation results. We have conducted experiments to measure the time complexity of the simulation in a function of the automaton size, alphabet size and word length. Examples of library usage are also provided.

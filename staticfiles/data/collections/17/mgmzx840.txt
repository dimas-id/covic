Surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is widely considered mandatory. The purpose of surveillance is to detect asymptomatic complications, so that early secondary intervention can prevent late aneurysm rupture. CT angiography has been taken as the reference standard imaging test, but there is increasing interest in using other modalities to reduce the use of ionising radiation and iodinated contrast. As a result, there is wide heterogeneity in surveillance strategies used among EVAR centres. We reviewed the current evidence available on the outcomes of different imaging modalities and surveillance strategies following EVAR.

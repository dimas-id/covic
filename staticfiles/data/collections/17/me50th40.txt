In 45 newly-weaned 3 to 4-week-old piglets, diarrhoea was induced by a combined infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains. In untreated control animals this dual inoculation resulted in profuse diarrhoea, vomiting, hypovolaemic shock and death of 77% of the animals within five days of TGE virus inoculation. Antisecretory drugs were administered intramuscularly for three consecutive days after experimental infection. The neurolepticum chlorpromazine, at 2 mg/kg/24 h, resulted in a significant inhibition of diarrhoea and vomiting, and in an increase in weight gain and survival. Sedation and hypothermia, however, were serious side-effects. The α(2) agonist clonidine, at 80 μg/kg/12 h, induced a significant antidiarrhoeal effect and a reduction in mortality. The drug, however, provoked decreased activity of α(2)-adrenergic excitation and incoordination. The β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, at 0.33 mg/kg/8 h, and the calcium channel blocker verapamil, at 2 mg/kg/8 h, had no beneficial effect on the experimentally induced diarrhoea.

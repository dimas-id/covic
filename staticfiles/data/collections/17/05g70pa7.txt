Abstract From the minute our organization received our first presumptive positive COVID-19 patient, and throughout our journey, many challenges and obstacles have been presented for health care leadership. Priorities are rapidly shifting, anxiety and fear are present, and knowing where to focus support is a challenge. As I sit and reflect on lessons learned throughout this experience, I can't help but continue to focus on frontline leadership and their important role in this entire process.

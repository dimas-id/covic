Acute pancreatitis is characterized by zymogen pre-activation. Severe inflammation caused by zymogen activation can eventually lead to multiple organ dysfunctions, which contributes to the high mortality rate of severe acute pancreatitis. However, there is no specific treatment available for acute pancreatitis therapy. Here, we show that spautin-1, which effectively inhibits autophagy flux, ameliorated the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein or L-Arginine. CaMKII phosphorylation due to cytosolic calcium oeverload was revealed in this paper. It was also demonstrated that autophagic protein aggregates degradation blockade accompanying with impaired autophagy correlated positively to intra acinar cells digestive aymogen activation sitimulated by cerulein or L-Arginine. The role of spautin-1 in ameliorating acute pancreatitis was shown here to be associated with impaired autophagy inhibition and Ca2+ overload alleviation. We provided a promising therapy for acute pancreatitis here through targeting both impaired autophagy and increased cytosolic calcium.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow-diverting devices now offer a new treatment alternative for cerebral aneurysms. We present the results of a large single-center series of patients treated with the PED, including long-term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between November 2008 and September 2011, sidewall aneurysms with a wide neck (≥4 mm) or unfavorable dome-neck ratio (≤1.5); large/giant, fusiform, dissecting, blister-like, and recurrent sidewall aneurysms; aneurysms at difficult angles; and aneurysms in which a branch was originating directly from the sac were treated with the PED. Patients were premedicated with dual antiplatelet medications. Data, including demographics, aneurysm features, clinical presentation, complications, results, and follow-up information, for up to 2 years are presented. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-one aneurysms in 191 patients were treated. Of these, 96 (38.3%) were large or giant (≥10 mm). In 34/251 (13.5%), PEDs were used for retreatment. Adjunctive coiling was performed in 11 aneurysms (2.1%). The mean number of devices per aneurysm was 1.3. One aneurysm ruptured in the fourth month posttreatment (0.5%), and symptomatic in-construct stenosis was detected in 1 patient (0.5%) treated with percutaneous transarterial angioplasty. Any event rate was 27/191 (14.1%), with a permanent morbidity of 1% and mortality of 0.5%. Control angiography was available in 182 (95.3%) patients with 239 (95.2%) aneurysms. In 121 aneurysms (48.2%), 1- to 2-year control angiography was available. The aneurysm occlusion rate was 91.2% in 6 months, increasing to 94.6%. CONCLUSIONS Use of the PED is safe, efficacious, and durable in cerebral aneurysm treatment, with low morbidity-mortality and high occlusion rates as confirmed with mid- to long-term control angiography.

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid and drastic shift for clinicians and patients away from traditional in-person visits and toward Internet-based virtual visits. The adoption of telehealth services is likely to persist in some capacity even as in-person visits resume, given the convenience and efficiency of telehealth consultations for patients and perhaps surgeons. A primary challenge of virtual visits, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery, is the physical examination. However, for the foot and ankle, routine physical examination maneuvers can be completed virtually with little modification given proper patient instruction. We present a comprehensive virtual foot and ankle examination for telehealth visits, including instructions that can be provided to patients verbatim and a corresponding checklist for provider documentation. Level of Evidence: Level V, expert opinion.

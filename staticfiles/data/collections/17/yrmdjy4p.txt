BACKGROUND: In late December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) first outbroke in Wuhan city, China, and has now become a global pandemic. However, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID‐19. METHODS: This study enrolled 33 COVID‐19 patients in the nineth hospital of Nanchang from January 27(th) to February 24(th), 2020. Clinical indexes of patients upon admission/discharge were examined. Patients were divided into two groups according to different treatment plans (Danoprevir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir). The days to achieve negative nucleic acid testing and the days of hospital stays were counted and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: COVID‐19 patients treated with Danoprevir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir were all improved and discharged. Indexes like blood routine, inflammation and immune‐related indexes were significantly recovered after treatment. Additionally, under the circumstance that there was no significant difference in patients’ general information between the two groups, we found that the mean time to achieve negative nucleic acid testing and hospital stays of patients treated with Danoprevir both were significantly shorter than those of patients with Lopinavir/Ritonavir. CONCLUSION: Collectively, applying Danoprevir is a good treatment plan for COVID‐19 patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The data science and AI community has gathered around the world to support tackling the climate change problem in different domains. This research aims to work on the air quality through emissions and pollutant concentration data along with vegetation information. Authorities especially in urban cities like London have been very vigilant in monitoring these different aspects of air quality and reliable sources of big data are available in this domain. This study aims to mine and collate this information spread all over the place in different formats into usable knowledge base on which further data analysis and powerful Machine Learning approaches can be built to extract strong evidences useful in building better policies around climate change.

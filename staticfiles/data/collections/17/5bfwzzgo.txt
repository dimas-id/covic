An observational study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Isospora suis oocysts in fecal samples from suckling piglets in Ontario, and to evaluate the relationship between the presence of I. suis oocysts and diarrhea. Fifty farms and 709 litters of piglets were included in the study. Oocysts were detected on 70% of farms, with 187 litters infected. A litter of pigs that was positive for oocysts was significantly more likely to exhibit diarrhea than a litter that was negative [odds ratio (OR) = 4.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.8 to 5.8; P < 0.001]. Management and housing factors were examined with respect to risk factors for the presence of I. suis. Farms that did not use a detergent when cleaning farrowing crates were 10-times more likely to be positive for I. suis than those that used a detergent (P = 0.007). It was concluded that coccidiosis is a common problem on Ontario swine farms.

Recently, it was shown that aminopeptidase N (E.C. 3.4.11.2, CD13) is up-regulated during mitogenic stimulation of peripheral T-cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the half-life of APN mRNA was considerably prolonged in these cells leading to a 2.7-fold increase of APN transcript level. The apparent half-life time of the APN transcript was investigated by the RNA synthesis inhibitor-chase method using actinomycin D. The steady-state APN mRNA levels was determined by a competitive RT-PCR. The half-lives estimated in resting T-cells, natural killer cells and permanently growing tumour cells varied between 3.5 and 6 h. Finally, nuclear run-on assays revealed that the APN gene expression of stimulated T-cells is controlled by increased promoter activity as well. These studies suggest a control of APN gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in addition to promoter-mediated regulation.

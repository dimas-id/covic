BACKGROUND The vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) used to be a common restrictive bariatric procedure but has been abandoned by many due to a high failure rate, a high incidence of long-term complications, and the newer adjustable gastric band (AGB) and sleeve. However, potential favorable long-term results and the upcoming banded gastric bypass, with a similar mechanical outlet restriction and control of the pouch size, renewed our interest in the VBG. Therefore, we investigated the long-term outcome of primary VBG at the Catharina Hospital in the Netherlands. METHODS Patients that underwent a primary VBG between 1998 and 2008 were included. Patients' characteristics, operative details, evolution on weight and comorbidities, complications, and outcome of revisions were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 392 patients (80 % female) were reviewed with a mean age of 40 ± 9 years and body mass index of 44 ± 5 kg/m(2). Mean follow-up after VBG was 66 ± 50 months and showed a mean excess weight loss (EWL) of 53 ± 27 % and comorbidity reduction of 54 %. One hundred fifty-two patients (39 %) out of 227 patients (58 %) with long-term complaints underwent revisional surgery. Main reasons for revision were weight regain and vomiting/food intolerance. Analysis before revision showed an outlet dilatation (17 %), pouch dilatation (16 %), and outlet stenosis (10 %). After revision, an additional EWL of 23 % and 33 % further reduction in comorbidities was seen. CONCLUSIONS Primary VBG has an acceptable EWL of 53 % and 55 % of comorbidities were improved. However, the high complication rate, often necessitating revision, underlines the limits of this procedure.

This report is a condensation of data from a collaborative study proposed and sponsored by the Antiviral Substances Program of NIAID. The individual reports were prepared by the following persons: S. Baron and M. Worthington, NIAID, NIH; A. Friedman-Kien, New York University College of Medicine; J. C. Duenwald, Washington State University, L. A. Glasgow, M. Harmon, B. Janis, E. Kern, J. C. Overall, Jr., C. B. Smith, D. A. Stringfellow, and S. Westerberg, University of Utah College of Medicine; B. C. Easterday and E. H. Weinberg, University of Wisconsin.* Recently there has been much interest in isoprinosine as a broad-spectrum antiviral compound. The activity of this substance was evaluated in a coordinated study at five institutions. Experimental models in five species of animals were established using 11 viruses. Criteria for selection were: (l) representation of most major groups of viruses, (2) reproduction of natural routes of infection, and (3) simulation of potentially treatable viral infections of man. No therapeutic effect could be demonstrated in infections with encephalomyocarditis virus, type 2 Herpesvirus hominis, influenza, and rabies viruses in mice; vaccinia virus in rabbits; rhinotracheitis and panleukopenia viruses in cats; distemper virus in ferrets; and influenza and transmissible gastroenteritis viruses in swine. The only antiviral activity observed in this extensive series of experiments was suppression of fibroma virus lesions in rabbits given 600 mg/ kg per day of isoprinosine. Although antiviral activity is not precluded in other viral infections in animals or in man, these results clearly fail to substantiate the potential of isoprinosine as a potent, broad-spectrum antiviral substance.

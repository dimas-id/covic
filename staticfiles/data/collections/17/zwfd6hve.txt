Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium protozoan parasites and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is diffused in tropical areas, where it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. P. falciparum is the most dangerous species, mainly affecting young children. The parasite cycle occurs both in humans (asexual stages) and in mosquitoes (sexual stages). In humans, Plasmodium grows and multiplies within red blood cells using hemoglobin as essential source of nutrients and energy. However, this process generates toxic heme that the parasite aggregates into an insoluble inert biocrystal called hemozoin. This molecule sequesters in various organs (liver, spleen, and brain), potentially contributing to the development of malaria immunopathogenesis. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria clinical frame ranges from asymptomatic infection to classic symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, headache, and muscle aches. However, malaria can also evolve into severe life-threatening complications, including cerebral malaria, severe anemia, respiratory distress, and acute renal failure.

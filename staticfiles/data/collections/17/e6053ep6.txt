Within 30 years of Laveranâ€™s discovery of human malaria parasites in 1880, four species, Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malar-iae and P. ovale, had been described and their morphological distinguishing features clarified. Although other diagnostic techniques have been developed, 130 years later the gold standard is still examination of thick and thin blood films. Recently a fifth species, the monkey malaria Plasmodium knowlesi, has been found to infect humans in parts of Southeast Asia. With human activities continuing to impinge on the habitats of other primates, it is possible that other malaria species may cross over to humans as well.

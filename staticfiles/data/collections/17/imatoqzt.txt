BACKGROUND: Despite recommendations for influenza vaccination of people aged 65 and above, uptake rate of influenza vaccines remains low. This study aims to understand barriers and motivators behind older adult’s decision on influenza vaccination. METHODS: Face to face interviews with participants aged 65 and above were conducted and audio recorded in Geylang polyclinic in Singapore. Thematic content analysis was used to organise the data. RESULTS: 15 older adults were interviewed, aged between 66 and 85 years old. 6 were vaccine refusers, 3 defaulters and 6 acceptors. A perceived lack of vulnerability, fear of side effects, and trivialisation of influenza were common reasons for not taking the vaccine. Encouragement from family and friends, travel and previous positive vaccination experiences were motivators for getting vaccinated. Healthcare workers played a role in influencing many of the participants’ decision-making. Common misconceptions included vaccines considered as necessary only before travel and as a cure rather than prevention. Most participants exhibited ambivalence, giving reasons both for and against vaccine uptake. DISCUSSION: Most older adults do not perceive influenza as a potentially serious disease nor trust in influenza vaccines’ efficacy. Misconceptions played a significant role in vaccine decline. Novel findings include the importance of the family unit in decision making, prioritization of chronic health problems over vaccination and misconception that vaccines are only needed when travelling out of country. Healthcare workers and family members appear to be important influencers in the decision making of older adults and should be actively engaged in future health promotion initiatives.

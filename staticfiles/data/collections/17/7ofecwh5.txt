Tasmania contributes very few laboratory confirmed cases to Australia's national influenza surveillance statistics. In 2004, a study was conducted to pilot test sentinel syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness supplemented by point-of-care testing using the Binax Now Flu A Test Kit and by viral culture, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this method of surveillance. Overall, the goal of such a system would be to increase laboratory surveillance activity within Tasmania and increase the number of specimens sent for viral culture. Five sites participated in the study, including three public hospital emergency departments and two general practices. Despite being conducted during a period of low influenza activity, the pilot study demonstrated that augmentation of syndromic surveillance with point-of-care testing is both feasible and acceptable but is best conducted in the general practice setting.

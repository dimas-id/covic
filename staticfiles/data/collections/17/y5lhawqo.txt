Abstract Background Successful airway management is critical to the practice of emergency medicine. Thus, emergency physicians must be ready to optimize and prepare for airway management in critically ill patients with a wide range of physiologic challenges. Challenges in airway management commonly encountered in the emergency department are discussed using a pearl and pitfall discussion in this first part of a two-part series. Objective This narrative review presents an evidence-based approach to airway and patient management during endotracheal intubation in challenging cases commonly encountered in the emergency department. Discussion Adverse events during emergent airway management are common with post-intubation cardiac arrest reported in as many as 1 in 25 intubations. Many of these adverse events can be avoided by proper identification and understanding the underlying physiology, preparation, and post intubation management. Those with high risk features including severe metabolic acidosis; shock and hypotension; obstructive lung disease; pulmonary hypertension, right ventricle failure, and pulmonary embolism; and severe hypoxemia must be managed with airway expertise. Conclusions This narrative review discusses the pearls and pitfalls of commonly encountered physiologic high-risk intubations with a focus on the emergency clinician.

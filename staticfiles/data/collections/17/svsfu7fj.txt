Borna disease virus (BDV), which seems to be distinct from all other known viruses, exhibits a unique mechanism of pathogenesis. This review highlights several aspects of the biology of infection with this virus and summarizes the preliminary characterization of the agent. Studies on BDV may help to illuminate several important areas of neurobiology, including the mechanisms regulating the replication of a new type of RNA virus in the nuclei of neural cells, the neuroinvasiveness and neurotropism of such viruses, their T cell-mediated immunopathology, tolerance in newborn animals to persistent viral infection of the central nervous system, and behavioral diseases and eating disorders induced by such agents.

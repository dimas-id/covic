INTRODUCTION Appendectomy is performed on almost 700 000 patients per year in the European Community, rendering it the most common acute surgical procedure. Since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery, there has been increased interest in carrying out procedures with fewer incisions and less ports. MATERIALS AND METHODS After the inception of single-port access, it is possible to insert into the abdominal cavity multiple instruments through a single device. A total of 15 patients--mean age 22 years and mean body mass index 27 kg/m(2)--with acute appendicitis were included in this study. RESULTS Mean operative time was 35 minutes with no conversions. Local suction drain was needed in 2 patients. Mean hospital stay was less than 24 hours with no complications. CONCLUSION Single-port suprapubic appendectomy is feasible and safe, and can allow a more direct vision of the operating field depending on the position of the appendix and presents good cosmetic and postoperative outcomes.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of nucleic acid extracted from stool samples of diarrhoeic children revealed in 3 out of 690 (0.43 %) specimens two electrophoretic bands with a migration pattern characteristic of picobirnavirus ds-RNA. In none of the 92 control children were similar bands detected. No other potential enteric pathogens were found in the patients with picobirnavirus infection.

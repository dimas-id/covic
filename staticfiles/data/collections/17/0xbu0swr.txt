OBJECTIVES To describe a novel balloon sizing technique used during adult transcatheter patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. In addition, to determine the clinical and procedural outcomes in six patients who underwent PDA balloon sizing with subsequent deployment of a PDA occluder device. BACKGROUND Transcatheter PDA closure in adults has excellent safety and procedural outcomes. However, PDA sizing in adults can be challenging due to variable defect size, high flow state, or anatomical complexity. We describe a series of six cases where the balloon- pull through technique was successfully performed for PDA sizing prior to transcatheter closure. METHODS Consecutive adult patients undergoing adult PDA closure at our institution were studied retrospectively. A partially inflated sizing balloon was pulled through the defect from the aorta into the pulmonary artery and the balloon waist diameter was measured. Procedural success and clinical outcomes were obtained. RESULTS Six adult patients underwent successful balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing during transcatheter PDA closure, since conventional angiography often gave suboptimal opacification of the defect. All PDAs were treated with closure devices based on balloon PDA sizing with complete closure and no complications. In three patients that underwent preprocedure computed tomography, the balloon size matched the CT derived measurements. CONCLUSION The balloon pull-through technique for PDA sizing is a safe and accurate sizing modality in adults undergoing transcatheter PDA closure.

BACKGROUND Chronic pain is a common complication arising after conventional open herniorrhaphy and to a lesser extent postlaparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs as groin incision is avoided. Although published studies support elimination of mesh fixation during endoscopic procedures, the vast majority of surgeons will still recommend it by fear of encountering increased recurrence rates, if omitted. Regrettably, penetrating staple or tack fixation devices are the preferred methods to secure the mesh and cannot be applied at the level of the triangles of 'doom' and 'pain' where hernia tends to reoccur the most. This ongoing prospective cohort study aimed to confirm the safety and advantages of fibrin glue, as a substitute to staple mesh fixation during totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Over a 10-year period, 703 patients underwent 1000 elective TEP inguinal hernia repairs. Mesh fixation was achieved using exclusively fibrin sealant. Patients were reviewed at 2, 6 weeks and thereafter on an ad hoc basis if judged necessary until complete resolution of their symptoms. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed in a subgroup of 320 patients using the Carolina Comfort Scale (CCS). RESULTS No conversion to open surgery was observed. There were three cases of major morbidities and no mortality. Three months after surgery, only seven patients (1 %) experienced chronic groin or testicular discomfort and none of them required prescription painkillers. When using the CCS, at 2 weeks 93.1 % of the patients were either satisfied or very satisfied with their outcome. This satisfaction index increased up to 99.2 % at 6 weeks post surgery. Finally, only eight hernia recurrences (1.1 %) were reported, of which five occurred during the first month of the study. CONCLUSION Fibrin glue mesh fixation of inguinal hernia during TEP repair is extremely safe and reliable, with a very high satisfaction index for the patients and limited risk of developing chronic pain.

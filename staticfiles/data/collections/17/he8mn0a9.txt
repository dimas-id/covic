Abstract The viral epidemic caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the new Coronavirus disease -2019 (Covid-19). This epidemic imposes upheavals in our organizations in healthcare centres which should not obscure the importance of nutritional care. The nutritional diagnosis and the early nutritional care management of Covid-19 infected patients must be integrated into the overall therapeutic strategy, as with any acute situation of acute illness. This document was prepared by the French speaking Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNCM) in the emergency of the health crisis by a group of experts, based on the national and international recommendations available in the field of malnutrition, critical illness, metabolic stress and intensive care medicine on March 23, 2020. We hope that this article will bring to healthcare professionals, especially those not specialized in nutrition, useful landmarks to help them to manage hospitalized patients, infected or not by Covid-19 in the context of epidemic and intrahospital confinement.

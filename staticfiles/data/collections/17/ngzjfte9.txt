The last 20 years have seen many advances in transfusion therapy and safety. Blood products are biological products engendering complex interactions with the immune system. Prestorage leukoreduction results in a reduced risk of febrile reactions, CMV transmission, and immune modulation, proving to be safer for patients than non-leuko reduced products. Simple patient identification issues and clerical error continue to be the primary causes of ABO-incompatible transfusions. Rigorous donor screening as well as serologic and nucleic acid testing for transfusion transmitted infection have brought the blood supply to a very safe level, although transmission of these agents continues to be a problem in underdeveloped countries. Emerging infectious diseases, beyond current laboratory detection capabilities, combined with global travel, pose unknown imminent risks everywhere. We also briefly discuss the current risks of transfusion-transmitted infections. We review currently available hemostatic blood products, their compositions, and their clinical indications; we mention product modifications currently in development; and we touch upon the hemostatic properties and drawbacks of whole blood, which is currently gaining popularity as an alternative to split blood products. We conclude with an in-depth overview of the risks associated with transfusion, including incompatibility, hemolytic transfusion reactions, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).

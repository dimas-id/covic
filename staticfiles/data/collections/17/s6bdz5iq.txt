The growth of large, intensive pig operations has made effective vaccination imperative in the swine industry. This growth in size has been accompanied by outbreaks of disease such as porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhea. These have caused massive losses, and effective vaccines are not yet available. Older diseases such as pleuropneumonia, erysipelas, enzootic pneumonia, proliferative enteritis, pseudorabies, and colibacillosis still persist, and classical swine fever and influenza remain as ongoing threats. The large size of many operations has required the introduction of mass vaccination procedures such as vaccination through drinking water. The current African swine fever pandemic makes the development of an effective vaccine against this virus, a matter of urgent necessity.

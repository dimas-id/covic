BACKGROUND In the context of COVID-19 home confinement, objective, real-time data are needed to assess the population's adherence to home confinement in order to adapt policies and control measures. OBJECTIVE Wearable activity trackers provide continuous monitoring of people's natural activity patterns whatever their location. We asked whether the huge amount of data they provide might reflect adherence to confinement rules. METHODS We analyzed data on number of steps per day from over 740,000 individuals around the world. RESULTS Results: We show physical activity patterns in several representative countries with total, partial or no home confinement. The decrease in steps per day regions with strict total home confinement ranged from -25 to -54%. CONCLUSIONS Aggregate analysis of activity tracker data, with the potential for a daily update, can inform governments on the adherence to home-confinement policies. CLINICALTRIAL

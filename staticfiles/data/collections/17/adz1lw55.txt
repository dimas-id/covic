The majority of the genome is noncoding and was thought to be nonfunctional. However, it is now appreciated that transcriptional control of protein coding genes resides within these noncoding regions. Thousands of genes encoding long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been recently identified throughout the genome, which positively or negatively regulate transcription of neighboring target genes. Both TMEVPG1 and its mouse ortholog encode lincRNAs and are positioned near the IFN-Î³ gene (IFNG). In this study, we show that transcription of both mouse and human TMEVPG1 genes is Th1 selective and dependent on Stat4 and T-bet, transcription factors that drive the Th1 differentiation program. Ifng expression is partially restored in Stat4-/-Tbx21-/- cells through coexpression of T-bet and Tmevpg1, and Tmevpg1 expression contributes to, but alone is not sufficient to, drive Th1-dependent Ifng expression. Our results suggest that TMEVPG1 belongs to the general class of lincRNAs that positively regulate gene transcription.

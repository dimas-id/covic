Families of internationally adopted children face risks associated with travel if they pick up their children overseas. Unlike other travelers, they also face risks because of close contact with a child with uncertain infection and vaccination status. Tuberculosis organisms, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, and measles virus have been transmitted from adopted children to family and community members. Intestinal parasites, Bordetella pertussis, and other infectious disease agents can also be transmitted. Some of these infections may be inapparent or may not manifest in adopted children until many years after the adoption. Increased attention to preventive measures for family members and early diagnosis of infectious diseases in adopted children can reduce transmission of the organisms causing these infections. Those providing health care to families planning international adoption should know about standard pretravel advice, as well as the spectrum of possible infections in adopted children, so that they can protect the health of the travelers and family members and close friends who will welcome the new child into the home.

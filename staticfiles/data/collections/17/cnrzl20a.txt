The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic continues, with the number of infections and deaths increasing The respiratory tract is the main route of transmission of the virus, and the majority of symptoms are respiratory relative Until now, there has been no reports concerning the nervous system onset We present a 2019-nCoV patient with the onset of simple dizziness, accompanied by dry throat, no fever, no cough, no headache, no mental abnormality, and no obvious abnormality in the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head Meanwhile, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed multiple small spot shadows and interstitial changes in the early stage, especially in the extrapulmonary zone There was a development of multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with mild pleural effusion The nucleic acid gene detection was positive, and thus the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV was confirmed At last, the prognosis was good after active treatment After antiviral and anti-infective treatment, the symptoms recovered We presume that 2019-nCoV can also manifest in the nervous system alone, and lung CT, which has relative specificity, should be used as a routine screening method

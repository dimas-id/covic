Renal artery entrapment by the diaphragmatic crus is a very infrequent cause of renovascular hypertension. We present the case of a young man who was assigned to our hospital with arterial hypertension and stenosis of the left renal artery. Extrinsic compression was diagnosed by duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography. We performed laparoscopic decompression using the transperitoneal retrorenal approach. Antihypertensive medication could be stopped thereafter and duplex ultrasound revealed a normal blood flow to the left renal artery. We therefore propose laparoscopic treatment of left renal artery entrapment as a minimally-invasive alternative to open surgery.

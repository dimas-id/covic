OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of ReCell® autologous cell regeneration techniques combined with dermabrasion treatment on the therapy of acne scars. METHODS We analyzed retrospectively 78 patients with acne scars who presented to the Department of Plastic Surgery at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from May 2015 to May 2017; 30 patients were treated with dermabrasion (Group 1), and the other 48 patients were treated with ReCell® autologous regeneration techniques combined with dermabrasion (Group 2). Efficacy was evaluated through self-evaluation of the patient, third-party evaluation and photographs taken before and after treatment. The wound healing time and postoperative complication rate were also recorded. RESULTS The study revealed a significant difference in healing time (P < 0.001) between patients treated with dermabrasion (Group 1) and patients treated with ReCell® autologous regeneration techniques combined with dermabrasion (Group 2). The average healing time of Group 1 was 12.30 ± 1.725 days, while the average healing time of Group 2 was 5.27 ± 1.086 days. In Group 2, patient self-evaluation and third-party evaluation were more satisfactory than those of Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, there were no postoperative complications in Group 2 such as pigmentation and scar hyperplasia. CONCLUSION The ReCell® technique is simple, minimally invasive, biocompatible and effective in the treatment of acne scars. It can shorten healing time and reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications, thereby providing a safe and effective treatment approach for patients with facial acne scars.

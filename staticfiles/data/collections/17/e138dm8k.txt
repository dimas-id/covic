With the emergence of COVID-19, it is important to address the possible scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Although several researchers have addressed the possible mechanisms of enveloped virus transfection, for example, influenza, here, the relationship between exhaled virus laden-particles, the climate, and transfection probability is discussed by interpreting the findings of prior studies. Importantly, the higher probability of viral transfection in cold and dry public spaces such as near cold shelves of groceries is illustrated. Thus, additional protective measures in such spaces are recommended.

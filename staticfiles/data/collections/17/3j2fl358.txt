Community-networks such as families and schools may foster and propagate some types of public health disasters. For such disasters, a communitarian-oriented ethical lens offers useful perspectives into the underlying relational nexus that favors the spread of infection. This chapter compares two traditional bioethical lenses—the communitarian and care ethics framework—vis-à-vis their capacities to engage the moral quandaries elicited by pandemic influenza. It argues that these quandaries preclude the analytical lens of ethical prisms that are individual-oriented but warrant a people-oriented approach. Adopting this dual approach offers both a contrastive and a complementary way of rethinking the underlying socioethical tensions elicited by pandemic influenza in particular and other public health disasters generally.

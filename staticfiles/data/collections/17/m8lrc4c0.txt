The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a family of large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses which has been considered as a global health concern as it has a very high transmissibility potential. Regarding to the similarity of the virus to SARS-CoV, it is postulated that the Covid-19 accumulates mainly in the nasal epithelia and lower respiratory airways. However, there is evidence suggesting the Covid-19 neurotropism which might contribute to respiratory failure. Here in we aim to review the central nervous system complications of the Covid-19 CoV since the emergence of the virus. Keywords: Novel Coronavirus, Covid19-Cov, CNS Complication, Nervous System.

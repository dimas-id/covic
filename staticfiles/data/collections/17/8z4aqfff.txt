"Emerging infections" have been defined as infections that have newly appeared, that have appeared previously but are expanding in incidence and geographic range, or that threaten to increase in the near future. This article focuses on nine emerging viral infectious agents. These viruses illustrate how such agents emerge: by encroaching on previously unvisited habitats (eg, hantaviruses), by air travel (eg, SARS), and by accidental importation (eg, monkeypox). Additionally, the example of SARS demonstrates not only how quickly emerging viral infections can spread but also how quickly they can be identified and contained with motivated cooperation.

In the context of the modern nation state, the ecology of infectious diseases cannot be described by interacting populations alone, as much of the modeling literature implicitly presumes (Wallace and Wallace 2016). Modern states incorporate elaborate public health bureaucracies tasked with either containing or eliminating pathogen outbreaks. States are thus highly cognitive entities at the institutional level. It is then appropriate, indeed arguably necessary, to reconsider vector-borne infection from a control theory perspective.

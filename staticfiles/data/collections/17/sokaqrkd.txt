Objective: The mean hospitalization time and outcome among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was estimated with the purpose of providing evidence for decision-making in medical institutions and governments in epidemic areas. Method：The data of COVID-19 patients in china were collected from the websites of provincial and municipal health commissions. The mean hospitalization time and mortality in the mild or severe patients and the mean time from severe to mild illness were calculated by Gaussian mixture modeling. Results: The mean hospitalization time among mild patients in Hubei province, other areas except Hubei province, and the national areas was 20.71 ± 9.30, 16.86 ± 8.24, and 19.34 ± 9.29 days, respectively. The mean transition time from severe to mild illness in the above three areas were 15.00, 17.00, and 14.99 days, respectively. The death rate of mild and severe patients in Hubei province and the national areas were 1.10% and 18.14%, and 1.10% and 17.70%, respectively. Among those patients who died of COVID-19, the mean time from severe transition to death in Hubei province and the national areas was 6.22 ± 5.12 and 6.35 ± 5.27 days, respectively. Conclusion: There were regional differences in the average length of stay between Hubei province and other regions, which may be related to different medical configurations. For those severe patients who died of COVID-19, the average time from hospitalization to death was about one week, and proper and effective treatments in the first week were critical.

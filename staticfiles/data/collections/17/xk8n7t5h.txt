The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nucleocapsid protein stimulated translation of a chimeric reporter mRNA containing an intact MHV 5'-untranslated region and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding region. The nucleocapsid protein binds specifically the tandemly repeated-UCYAA- of the MHV leader. This RNA sequence is the same as the intergenic motif found in the genome RNA. Preferential translation of viral mRNA in MHV infected cells is stimulated in part by this interaction and represents a specific, positive translational control mechanism employed by coronaviruses.

Many viruses regulate protein synthesis by -1 ribosomal frameshifting using an RNA pseudoknot. Frameshifting is vital for viral reproduction. Using the information gained from the recent high-resolution crystal structure of the beet western yellow virus pseudoknot, a systematic mutational analysis has been carried out in vitro and in vivo. We find that specific nucleotide tertiary interactions at the junction between the two stems of the pseudoknot are crucial. A triplex is found between stem 1 and loop 2, and triplex interactions are required for frameshifting function. For some mutations, loss of one hydrogen bond is sufficient to abolish frameshifting. Furthermore, mutations near the 5' end of the pseudoknot can increase frameshifting by nearly 300%, possibly by modifying ribosomal contacts. It is likely that the selection of suitable mutations can thus allow viruses to adjust frameshifting efficiencies and thereby regulate protein synthesis in response to environmental change.

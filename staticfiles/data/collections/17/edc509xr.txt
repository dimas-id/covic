This communication aims to advocate a more coordinate activity mainly between medical and environmental scientists to clarify some confusing information related to airborne diffusion mechanisms of COVID-19. In this frame it is suggested that parameters other than environmental pollution (accounting for pollution-to human transmission mechanisms), as for example parameters involving commercial exchanges (accounting for human-to human transmission mechanisms), should be considered to better justify the difference in the initial diffusion of virus in Italy.

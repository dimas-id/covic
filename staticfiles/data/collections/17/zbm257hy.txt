OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the personal protective equipment (PPE) utilized in common urologic procedures before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. As elective urologic procedures are being reduced to conserve resources, we sought to quantify the PPE used per case to determine the impact on potentially limited resources needed for protecting healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective analysis of all urologic procedures in March 2019 and March 2020 was performed. Additionally, all urologic procedures performed by vascular interventional radiology (VIR) in May 2019 and March 2020 were included in the analysis. Case length, surgical and operating room staff present and number of articles of PPE were quantified. Articles of PPE were defined as surgical bonnet/hat and mask, and disposable or reusable gown with 1 pair of surgical gloves. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-seven urologic and VIR procedures were included in the analysis. The mean PPE per case varied significantly between endoscopic and robotic categories. Robotic assisted laparoscopic cystectomy required the most hats and masks (14.5 per case in March 2019) whereas percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement by VIR required the fewest (3.1 in May 2019 and March 2020). CONCLUSION: PPE consumption varied significantly across urologic procedures. Robotic-assisted cases require the most PPE and percutaneous nephrostomy placement by VIR requires the fewest. While PPE shortages are currently being addressed national and internationally, our results provide a baseline benchmark for articles of PPE required should another pandemic or global disaster requiring careful attention to resource allocation occur in the future.

Endogenous processing of viral glycoproteins for presentation to CD4(+) T cells is a poorly investigated aspect of antigen processing and presentation. This pathway may involve not only pathogens, but also self proteins, and may thus be involved in self‐tolerance. We have characterized the processing of the endoplasmic reticulum‐restricted glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus, termed poison tail (Gpt), biochemically and enzymatically, and by T cell recognition assays. Expressed with a vaccinia vector, Gpt remains endoglycosidase H‐sensitive and does not mature to endoglycosidase D sensitivity. The protein is degraded in the ER with a T1/2 of 4 h. Gpt peptides are not secreted since Gpt‐infected cells are unable to sensitize uninfected antigen‐presenting cells in an innocent bystander assay. Using flow cytometry, Gpt is undetectable on the plasma membrane; in contrast, wild‐type G is readily found on the surface or secreted into the milieu as soluble G following infection of A20 cells with a vaccinia recombinant expressing G. The degradation of Gpt is sensitive to the thiol reagent diamide and occurs optimally at physiological pH. A series of proteolytic inhibitors were tested: 3,4‐dichloroisocoumarin and 1‐chloro‐3‐tosylamido‐7‐amino‐2‐heptanone inhibited degradation, which suggests the involvement of a serine protease. The degradation does not require transport to the Golgi complex, and is not sensitive to a variety of lysosomotropic agents. We show that the degradation products include the immunogenic epitopes recognized by a panel of T cell clones and hybridomas.

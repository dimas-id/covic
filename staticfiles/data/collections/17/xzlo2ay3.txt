In February 1980 blood samples from 91 women and their newborn babies (cord blood) from Mali have been analysed for influenza and corona OC 43 HI antibodies. The titers of influenza HI antibodies were higher in blood samples collected from the mothers at delivery than in their newborns. Considering the GMT values and percentage of persons with protective titers (greater than or equal to 1:40) we may assume that influenza A (H3N2) viruses had been highly active in Mali. Influenza A (H1N1) and B activity may be considered as minor. The prevalence of OC 43 coronaviruses HI antibodies was higher in the cord blood of the newborn babies (95%) than in the blood samples of their mothers (75%).

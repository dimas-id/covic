PURPOSE: Stigma is a common barrier to mental health professionals (MHPs) seeking help for occupational stress and burnout, although there is a lack of psychometrically sound tools to measure this construct. The current study aimed to develop and validate a scale (the Mental Health Professional Stigma Scale; MHPSS) for this purpose. METHODS: The MHPSS and related measures were completed by 221 Australian MHPs via online survey, with a subsample completing the MHPSS again 2 weeks after initial completion. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution, comprising of 13 items and accounting for 50.16% of variance. Factors were Perceived Other Stigma, Perceived Structural Stigma, Personal Stigma, and Self stigma. The internal consistency, testâ€“retest reliability, and validity of the scale were supported. CONCLUSIONS: The MHPSS has utility to capture stigmatising attitudes and beliefs related to occupational stress and burnout among MHPs. It may be used to assist in the development and evaluation of initiatives to reduce stigma and increase help-seeking among MHPs.

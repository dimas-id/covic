Hemodialysis (HD) patients exhibit poor functional capacity and reduced quality of life as a result of the complications associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A review of the literature indicates that regular physical activity can reduce the complications associated with ESRD by inducing adaptations in the cardiovascular, nervous, and musculoskeletal systems. In turn, this increases functional capacity and enhances quality of life in patients on HD. Hemodialysis patients can safely participate in a variety of exercise programs with minimal adverse effects. Intradialytic exercise programs that can incorporate aerobic and resistance exercise promote exercise adherence and should be encouraged on dialysis units.

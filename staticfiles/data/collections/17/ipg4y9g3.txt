The Forensic Science Institute of the French “Gendarmerie Nationale” (IRCGN™) developed in 2015 an ISO 17025 certified mobile DNA laboratory for genetic analyses. This Mobil’DNA laboratory is a fully autonomous and adaptable mobile laboratory to perform genetic analyses in the context of crime scenes, terrorism attacks or disasters. To support the hospital task force in Paris during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, we adapted this mobile genetic laboratory to perform high-throughput molecular screening for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. We describe the adaptation of this Mobil’DNA lab to assist in Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

Japanese domestic cats were surveyed for circulating antibodies to the plO and p24 proteins of the Borna disease virus (BDV) by Western blotting. Twenty-four of 52 cats (46.2%) with ataxia and other neurologic symptoms of unknown cause were positive for antibodies to BDV p10 and/or p24. In contrast, cats without neurological symptoms gave a significantly lower prevalence of anti-BDV antibodies to p10 and/or p24 (36 of 152 cats, 23.7%). Thirty specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats tested as controls were uniformly negative to BDV pl0 and p24 antigens. These results suggest that BDV may play a role in ataxia in cats. Additionally, our results suggest that it is necessary to use both p10 and p24 as antigens to detect circulating antibodies to BDV in cats.

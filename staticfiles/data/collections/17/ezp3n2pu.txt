Abstract Different viruses belonging to the genus Vesivirus infect a broad range of animals, and cause gastroenteritis, vesicular skin lesions, hemorrhagic disease, respiratory diseases and other conditions. A recent report on Vesivirus viremia, as detected by PCR, in samples from patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology in the USA suggested a zoonotic potential for vesiviruses. These results have not been confirmed by another laboratory. In order to do so, a generic PCR assay on the RNA polymerase region was developed, and validated with RNA from 69 different Vesivirus species. Except SMSV serotype-8, all species tested were detected, including the ones that were suggested to be involved in zoonotic transmission in the USA (SMSV serotype-5). The generic Vesivirus assay was used on RNA extracted from serum samples from patients with hepatitis, stool samples from patients with gastroenteritis, throat-swab specimens of patients with rash illnesses, throat-swab and nose-swabs of patients with acute respiratory diseases, and cell cultures with cytopathologic effect from enterovirus surveillance in which no pathogen was found. None were found positive. In this study a generic Vesivirus assay was developed and it was concluded that vesiviruses are an unlikely cause of common illnesses in humans in the Netherlands.

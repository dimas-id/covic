In order to establish immunological detection methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we established monoclonal antibodies directed against structural components of the virus. B cell hybridomas were generated from mice that were hyper-immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV virion. By screening 2,880 generated hybridomas, we established three hybridoma clones that secreted antibodies specific for nucleocapsid protein (N) and 27 clones that secreted antibodies specific for spike protein (S). Among these, four S-protein specific antibodies had in vitro neutralization activity against SARS-CoV infection. These monoclonal antibodies enabled the immunological detection of SARS-CoV by immunofluorescence staining, Western blot or immunohistology. Furthermore, a combination of monoclonal antibodies with different specificities allowed the establishment of a highly sensitive antigen-capture sandwich ELISA system. These monoclonal antibodies would be a useful tool for rapid and specific diagnosis of SARS and also for possible antibody-based treatment of the disease.

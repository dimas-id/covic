Abstract A blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting antibodies to the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in pig sera was developed and compared with the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA), the most widely used serological diagnostic test in Europe. The blocking ELISA was specific and more sensitive than the IPMA when applied to field sera and to sera which were collected early after an experimental infection with PRRSV. Problems with high background activity as observed in IPMA or indirect ELISA were not encountered.

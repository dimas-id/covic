ABSTRACT: Since a novel coronavirus was discovered from a cluster of patients with emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China, it has spread rapidly through droplet and contact transmission. Recently, the novel coronavirus pneumonia which was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been raised as a worldwide problem. Radiological examinations were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of COVID-19. It is reported that some radiologists and radiological technologists were infected when giving examinations to the patients with COVID-19. In order to reduce the infection risk of medical staff in radiology department, we summarized the experience on prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19, aiming to guide the prevention and practical work for radiologists and radiological technologists. KEY POINTS: • The novel coronavirus spreads rapidly through droplet and contact transmission. • Radiologists and radiological technologists were possibly infected by patients. • Prevention and control measures in radiology department for COVID-19 are important.

A novel library of amide functionality having 1,2,4-thiadiazole-1,2,4-triazole (8a–j) analogs was designed, synthesized, and structures were characterized by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and mass (ESI–MS) spectral data. Further, all compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activities against four different cancer cell lines including breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA MB-231), lung cancer (A549), and prostate cancer (DU-145) by MTT reduction assay method, and etoposide acts as a standard drug. The results confirmed that majority of the synthesized compounds showed moderate to potent anticancer activities aligned with four cell lines. Among the synthesized compounds, 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e, 8g and 8i displayed more potent activity along with inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.10 ± 0.084 to 11.5 ± 6.49 µM than the standard IC(50) values, which ranges from 1.91 ± 0.84 to 3.08 ± 0.135 µM, respectively.

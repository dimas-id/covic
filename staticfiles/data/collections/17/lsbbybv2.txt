INTRODUCTION Despite their appeal as vaccine vectors, adenoviral vectors are yet unable to induce protective immune responses against some weakly immunogenic antigens. Additionally, the maximum doses of adenovirus-based vaccines are limited by vector-induced toxicity, causing vector elimination and diminished immune responses against the target antigen. In order to increase immune responses to the transgene, while maintaining a moderate vector dose, new technologies for improved transgene presentation have been developed for adenoviral vaccine vectors.Areas covered:This review provides an overview of different genetic-fusion adjuvant technologies that aim to improve antigen presentation in the context of adenoviral vector-based vaccines. The influence on both T cell and B cell responses are discussed, with a main focus on two technologies: MHC class II-associated invariant chain and virus-like-vaccines.Expert opinion:Different strategies have been tested to improve adenovirus-based vaccinations with varying degrees of success. The reviewed genetic adjuvants were designed to increase antigen processing and MHC presentation, or promote humoral immune responses with an improved conformational antigen display. While none of the introduced technologies is universally applicable, this review shall give an overview to identify potential improvements for future vaccination approaches.

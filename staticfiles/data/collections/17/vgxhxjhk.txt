Abstract Despite the hard times COVID-19 has imposed on us, the Biomedical Journal strives to provide fresh and compelling reading material - to be enjoyed safely from home. In this issue, we glance behind the scenes of dental stem cell preservation for potential therapeutic use, and discover that cancer cells hijack podoplanin expression to induce thrombosis. Moreover, we learn how the helicase DDX17 promotes tumour stemness, how genetic defects in meiosis and DNA repair cause premature ovarian insufficiency, and that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor is associated with several psychiatric diseases. Further accounts relate the role of miR-95-3p in colorectal cancer, the protective power of eggplants against mercury poisoning, and the predictive value of inhibin A for premature delivery. Finally, the very rare case of adenoid cystic carcinoma in the external auditory canal receives some attention, and we get to read up on how 3D imaging and modelling combines functional and aesthetic repair of cleft lip and palate cases.

ABO blood groups have been related to COVID19 infection. ABO blood groups are slightly differently distributed in the populations and therefore these results should be replicated in the specific areas with a proper control population. In this work, we present data from 412 COVID19 patients and 17796 blood donors from Gipuzkoa, a region in Northern Spain. Our data shows the importance of group O as a protective factor.

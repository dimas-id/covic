Background: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have anti-inflammatory effects. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is increased by ARB/ACEI treatment, as a cell entry receptor. Therefore, the use of ARBs/ACEIs for COVID-19 remains controversial. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with hypertension before COVID-19 onset. The primary outcome was severe infection or all-cause mortality. Cases included ARB/ACEI use for 30 days or longer during the 6 months before COVID-19 onset. Primary controls included antihypertensive use other than ARBs/ACEIs (narrow control); secondary controls included all other hypertension patients (broad control). We investigated ARB/ACEI association with outcomes in general and by subgroups (age, sex, and presence of diabetes) using logistic regression models with propensity score matching. Findings: Of 234427 suspected COVID-19 patients we screened, 1585 hypertension patients were analyzed. In the 892 cases, 428 narrow controls, and 693 broad controls, severe infection or death occurred in 8.6%, 22.2%, and 16.7%, respectively. ARB/ACEI use was associated with a reduced risk of severe infection or death relative to the narrow control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.65) and broad control group (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.71). The association was smaller for newly diagnosed hypertension patients (aOR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.42 compared to narrow control group). ARB/ACEI protective effects against severe infection or death were significantly observed in male and diabetic patients. Interpretation: ARB/ACEI use was associated with a lower risk of severe infection or mortality compared to other antihypertensives or ARB/ACEI nonuse.

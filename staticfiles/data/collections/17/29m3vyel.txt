This paper identifies two structural proteins of the occluded derived viral envelope of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV): ODV-E18 and ODV-E35. In addition, we identify a protein, ODV-EC27, that is incorporated into the capsid of occluded virus, which is not detected in budded virus. The genes for these proteins reside within the IE0 intron. The intron was sequenced, and five open reading frames (ORF) were identified. ORF 3 (genomic ORF 143) codes for the ODV envelope protein, ODV-E18. ORF 4 (genomic ORF 144) codes for ODV-EC27, and Western blot analyses locate this protein to both the ODV capsid and envelope. Transcripts for both ODV-E18 and ODV-EC27 initiate from conserved TAAG motifs, and transcripts are detected from 16 through 72 hr p.i. Antiserum to ODV-E18 recognizes a band of 18 kDa on Western blots of extracts from infected cells and bands of 18 and 35 kDa on Western blots of proteins from purified ODV envelope. N-terminal amino acid sequencing reveals that both ODV-E18 and ODV-E35 contain the same N-terminus. Antiserum to ODV-EC27 recognizes a protein of 27 kDa on Western blots of extracts from infected cells and bands of 27 and 35 kDa on Western blots of proteins from purified ODV. Using immunogold labeling techniques, ODV-E18 and/or ODV-E35 are detected in viral induced intranuclear microvesicles and are not detected in the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic membranes, or the nuclear envelope. Immunogold labeling using antisera to ODV-EC27 detects this protein on both the ODV envelope and capsid.

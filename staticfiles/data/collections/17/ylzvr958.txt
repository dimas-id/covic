Abstract Background A seasonal peak in asthma exacerbations in the fall has previously been reported. The association between fall exacerbations and viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) remains uncertain. Objective To investigate the number of fall exacerbations and the incidence of RTIs in a pediatric asthmatic population using an at-home mucus collection methodology. Methods This was a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group exploratory study. Children, 4–11 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of asthma requiring use of an inhaled corticosteroid, a morning peak expiratory flow ≥70% predicted and a history of ≥1 asthma exacerbation during the previous respiratory viral season were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 100/50 mcg or FP 100 mcg prior to starting school. Subjects collected mucus samples using an at-home kit when they experienced respiratory symptoms. Mucus samples obtained during symptomatic periods were analyzed for common respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The number of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was recorded. Results In total, 339 (FP/SAL, n = 171; FP, n = 168) subjects were randomized and included in the intent-to-treat population; 292 (86%) completed the study. Of the 537 mucus samples collected, 64% tested positive for viruses, but only 6% of positive samples were associated with an asthma exacerbation. Exacerbations were infrequent, with only 41 subjects reporting 49 exacerbations in total. Adverse events were reported in 66% of subjects. Conclusions In a susceptible population, the fall asthma exacerbation rates in children were low despite frequent detection of viral RTIs. NCT01192178; GSK ID: ADA113872.

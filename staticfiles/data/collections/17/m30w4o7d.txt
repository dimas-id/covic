Abstract Aldol reaction of N,N-dibenzyl valinal with propiolic acid ethyl ester derived lithium reagent provides anti-aminoalcohol 8 and syn-aminoalcohol 9 , which are converted into the lactone 6 via two different routes. Alkylation of 6 followed by lactone ring opening afford the acid 2a , which is coupled with the amine 3 and 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxylate acid 1 , respectively, to deliver AG7088.

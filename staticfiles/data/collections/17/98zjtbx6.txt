Acute necrotizing encephalitis (ANE) is a rare complication of viral respiratory tract infections, with specific histological changes. The condition is most commonly described in the pediatric population, however, it can also develop in the elderly, with some genetic factors being described as contributory. Herein, we report the autopsy finding of a patient with a viral respiratory tract infection, complicated with ANE. The patient was a 77-year-old female with multiple comorbidities living in a social home. For the two months prior, she had been hospitalized with cerebral infarction, respiratory tract infection, and exacerbation of chronic cardiac failure and concomitant hypertension and type 2 diabetes. On gross examination, the brain was edematous, with ground-glass opacity meninges a focus of encephalomalacia in the right cerebral hemisphere and multiple petechial hemorrhages. Histology revealed diffuse foci of encephalitis, with large areas of neuronal necrosis (coagulative-like necrosis) around the blood vessels and a sharp border with the surrounding healthy parenchyma - ANE. The patients tested negative for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

AIM Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES(Â®); American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [Oak Brook, IL] and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [Los Angeles, CA]) is a new approach that allows surgical manipulations and specimen extractions through the natural orifices such as the vagina. There have been limited numbers of cases about the adaptation of NOTES for ventral hernia repairs. Here, we aimed to present two more cases and highlight our technical differences compared with the previously reported instances. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two patients (43 and 46 years old; body mass index of 29 and 30 kg/m(2), respectively) were treated with hybrid transvaginal incisional hernia repairs. Two 5-mm abdominal trocars were used to monitor transvaginal access, adhesiolysis, dissection of the hernia, and tuckering of the mesh. A 15-mm transvaginal trocar was used for scope and mesh introduction into the abdomen. Defects were 3-5 cm in diameter. RESULTS A rigid 5-mm laparoscope was used. The composite synthetic meshes were, respectively, 11 and 13 cm in diameter. These were passed through the vagina without any protection such as a bag or sheath. No conversion or additional port was required. Respective operative times were 120 and 180 minutes, and the patients were discharged uneventfully on the second day. One patient had seroma, which was managed conservatively (aspiration of 20 mL on Day 7). There were no recurrences after 7 and 13 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Conventional laparoscopic equipment can be used for hybrid transvaginal incisional hernia repair. An anti-adhesive synthetic mesh can be inserted through the vaginal trocar without protective devices. The main advantage of this technique is to avoid 10-15-mm abdominal trocars, which increase the risk of trocar-site hernias themselves.

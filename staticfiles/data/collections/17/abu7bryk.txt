BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Current nonhuman primate stroke models are limited by either stroke variability or survivability. A new nonhuman primate stroke model was developed by using endovascular trapping techniques to limit collateral vessels with serial MR imaging and neurologic assessments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight adult rhesus monkeys (female, 7-13 years of age) underwent MR imaging and Spetzler neurologic assessment followed by endovascular stroke induction consisting of superselective endovascular placement of surgical silk sutures into the right MCA by using a trapping technique. Two initial subjects were euthanized immediately following postocclusion MR imaging. The subsequent 6 subjects recovered and underwent follow-up MR imaging and Spetzler neurologic assessments at 48 hours, with 4 being followed to 96 hours. Stroke infarct volumes were measured, and the longitudinal Spetzler clinical neurologic scores were assessed. The brain tissues were harvested and prepared with hematoxylin-eosin staining. RESULTS Focal permanent cerebral ischemia was induced in the targeted right MCA territory in all subjects. The volumes of the ischemic lesions at 6, 48, and 96 hours were 3.18 ± 1.007 mL (standard error of the mean) (n = 8), 6.70 ± 1.666 mL (standard error of the mean) (n = 6), and 7.23 ± 1.371 mL (standard error of the mean) (n = 4). For the survival animals, the immediate postsurgical Spetzler grading score improved from 60.7 at 24 hours to 68.7 at 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS We report a trapping modification to an established endovascular suture stroke model that yielded reproducible ischemia and clinically quantifiable neurologic deficits with no strokes in nontarget areas. This technique may be useful in evaluating translational stroke and penumbral imaging research in addition to preclinical testing of neuroprotective therapies.

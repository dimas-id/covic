Fusion of MHV-3-immune splenocytes from MHV-3-resistant A/J murine strain, with NS myeloma cells produced several hybridomas. Among eight hybridoma clones, the 1E7A4H1 clone secreted kappa IgG2a apparently directed against the nucleoprotein of the MHV-3 virion. The monoclonal antibody was able to neutralize the in vitro cytopathic effect of MHV-3 on cultured L2 cells, and was detected by indirect immuno-fluorescence on MHV-3-infected cultured YAC cells. In addition, it conferred a significant protection against MHV-3-induced acute disease, if injected intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 mice before inoculation with MHV-3.

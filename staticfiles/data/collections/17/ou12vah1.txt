Blood samples from 95 randomly selected pet cats that were brought to veterinarians in southeastern Florida were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Virus-specific antibodies (indicative of virus infection) were found in 8 of the 95 (8.4%) cats tested. All of the virus-infected cats were males (statistically significant, P less than or equal to 0.016) and were at least 1 year of age. The 3 most severely ill cats infected with FIV were also infected with feline leukemia virus.

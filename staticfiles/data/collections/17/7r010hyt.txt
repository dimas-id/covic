ACPGBI and BDRF led the way on patient and public involvement (PPI) in colorectal research with the 2013-16 Delphi Games, which led to the integration of patients as key partners in research studies, as well as studies such as CIPHER and PREPARE ABC. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen the majority of colorectal research studies suspended, given the need for routine work to be reduced to focus resources on critical care. When we look to return to a new normal, these studies and others in the pipeline will resume.

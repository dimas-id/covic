This chapter discusses the methods for the separation and characterization of leukocytes from the intestine. Intestinal immune mechanisms must be studied directly and incorporated into models based on the observations made using intestinal cells and not just systemic cells. Numerous reports in the literature compare and contrast mucosal and systemic responses; however, despite their tissue-specific variations, the different tissues do interact. The procedures used to isolate cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are traumatic or include enzyme digestion. A technique should be selected that is efficient yet gentle enough to provide viable and functional cells. Moreover, the cells contaminating leukocyte preparations can affect the functional assays. This necessitates that positive controls are put through the procedure or even added to intestinal pieces before isolation. If these cells demonstrate a positive response following this handling, then one is more confident of negative results observed in the isolated intestinal cells.

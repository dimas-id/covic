Gastric cancer with metastases outside of the regional lymph nodes is deemed oncologically unresectable. Nevertheless, some metastatic lesions are technically resectable by applying established surgical techniques such as para-aortic lymphadenectomy and hepatectomy. At the time of compilation of the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines version 4, systematic reviews were conducted to see whether it is feasible to make any recommendation to dissect both the primary and metastatic lesions with intent to cure, possibly as part of multimodality treatment. Long-term survivors were found among carefully selected groups of patients both in prospective and retrospective studies. In addition, there is a growing list of publications reporting encouraging outcomes of gastrectomy conducted after exceptionally good response to chemotherapy, usually among patients who underwent R0 resection. This type of surgery is often referred to as conversion surgery. It is sometimes difficult to define a clear borderline between curative surgery scheduled after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the conversion surgery. This review summarizes what we knew after the literature reviews conducted at the time of compiling the Japanese guidelines and in addition reflects some new findings obtained thereafter through clinical trials and retrospective studies. Metastases were divided into three categories based on the major metastatic pathways: lymphatic, hematogenous, and peritoneal. In each of these categories, there were findings that could provide hope for patients with metastatic disease. These findings implied that the surgical technique that we already use could become more useful upon further developments in antineoplastic agents and drug delivery.

Prediction of intraoperative difficulties may be helpful in planning surgery; however, few studies explored this issue in laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). We performed retrospective analysis of consecutive 468 patients undergoing LS from 1998 to 2017 (295 women; median age 47 years). The patients were divided into difficult LS and control groups. The inclusion criteria for difficult LS were operative time ≥mean + 2SD; intraoperative blood loss ≥500 mL, intraoperative adverse events (IAE), conversion. Primary outcomes were risk factors for difficult splenectomy and secondary outcomes for perioperative morbidity. Fifty-six patients were included in the difficult LS group (12%). Spleens ≥19 cm and higher participation of younger surgeons in consecutive years were predictive for difficult splenectomy. Age ≥53 years and diagnosis other than idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) were independent risk factors of spleen ≥19 cm. The perioperative morbidity was 8.33%; its OR was increased only by blood loss and IAEs. Only blood loss significantly increased serious morbidity. Male sex, spleens ≥19 cm, and IAEs were independent risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage. Spleen length ≥19 cm was a risk factor for difficult LS and intraoperative hemorrhage. Diagnoses other than ITP in patients aged ≥53 years with ≥19 cm spleens are predictive for intraoperative difficulties and perioperative complications.

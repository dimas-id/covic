A molecular survey was conducted to understand recent distribution of pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) in Japan. Nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs were collected from asymptomatic dogs and those with CIRD, living in private house or in kennels. PCR-based examination was conducted for detecting nine pathogens. Among private household dogs, 50.8% with CIRD, 11.1% with respiratory disease other than CIRD, and 4.3% asymptomatic were positive for more than one pathogen, whereas in kennel-housed dogs, 42.9% with CIRD and 27.3% asymptomatic were positive. Bordetella bronchiseptica was most frequently detected, followed by canine herpesvirus 1, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, Mycoplasma cynos, and canine adenovirus type 2. In kennel environment, asymptomatic dogs might act as reservoirs carrying the respiratory pathogens.

The ResPlex I assay (Qiagen) was designed to amplify and detect DNA of six bacterial respiratory pathogens. This assay was compared with real-time PCR assays based upon the same target sequences for the ability detect the target bacteria by use of both stock strains and specimens from respiratory disease patients. The ResPlex I assay is somewhat less sensitive than real-time PCR assays but offers the advantage of multiple assays in a single reaction.

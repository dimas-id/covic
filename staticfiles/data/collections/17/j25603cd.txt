Abstract Digitization has led to smart, connected technologies be an integral part of businesses, governments and communities. For manufacturing digitization, there has been active research and development with a focus on Cloud Manufacturing (CM) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This work presents a computer vision toolkit (CV Toolkit) for non-invasive digitization of the factory floor in line with Industry 4.0 requirements for factory data collection. Currently, technical challenges persist towards digitization of legacy systems due to the limitation for changes in their design and sensors. This novel toolkit is developed to facilitate easy integration of legacy production machinery and factory floor artifacts with the digital and smart manufacturing environment with no requirement of any physical changes in the machines. The system developed is modular, and allows real-time monitoring of production machinery. The modularity aspect allows the incorporation of new software applications in the current framework of CV Toolkit. To allow connectivity of this toolkit with manufacturing floors in a simple, deployable and cost-effective manner, the toolkit is integrated with a known manufacturing data standard, MTConnect, to “translate” the digital inputs into data streams that can be read by commercial status tracking and reporting software solutions. The proposed toolkit is demonstrated using a mock-panel environment developed in house at the University of Cincinnati to highlight its usability.

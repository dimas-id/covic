OBJECTIVES In the context of common adhesion prevention in laparotomic, laparoscopic and hysteroscopic surgery this article details the effects of a cross-linked sodium hyaluronate anti-adhesion barrier gel. The observed adhesion score is expressed in the following three measurements: Severity, extent and incidents of adhesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS From a total of 85 patients treated by laparoscopy and hysteroscopy, a second look endoscopic procedure could be performed in 35 cases. RESULTS Our preliminary, short evaluation of 35 patients submitted to a second look laparoscopy or hysteroscopy revealed the beneficial effect of the applied HYAcorp endo gel, showing only a minimal amount of adhesions at the second look observation. CONCLUSION Cross-linked sodium hyaluronate is highly effective in the prevention of adhesions at laparoscopic and hysteroscopic surgery.

BACKGROUND Selective control of vascular inflow can reduce blood loss and transfusion rates and may be particularly efficient in laparoscopic liver resection (LLR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of selective prior vascular control (PVC) in patients undergoing laparoscopic or open liver resections (OLR). METHODS Between 1999 and 2008, 52 patients underwent LLR with PVC with prospective data collection and were compared with patients undergoing OLR with PVC. RESULTS There was no difference in the operative time between the 2 groups. Blood loss and transfusion rates were lower in patients who underwent LLR (367 vs 589 mL, P = .001; 3.8% vs 17.3%, P = .05, respectively). Morbidity did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Hospital stay was longer in the OLR group (11.0 vs 7.4 days, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS PVC during LLR was feasible and improved intraoperative and postoperative results. Selective PVC should be obtained in LLR whenever possible.

Cellular functions rely on a series of organized and regulated multienzyme cascade reactions. The catalytic efficiencies of these cascades depend on the precise spatial organization of the constituent enzymes, which is optimized to facilitate substrate transport and regulate activities. Mimicry of this organization in a non-living, artificial system would be very useful in a broad range of applicationsâ€”with impacts on both the scientific community and society at large. Self-assembled DNA nanostructures are promising applications to organize biomolecular components into prescribed, multidimensional patterns. In this review, we focus on recent progress in the field of DNA-scaffolded assembly and confinement of multienzyme reactions. DNA self-assembly is exploited to build spatially organized multienzyme cascades with control over their relative distance, substrate diffusion paths, compartmentalization and activity actuation. The combination of addressable DNA assembly and multienzyme cascades can deliver breakthroughs toward the engineering of novel synthetic and biomimetic reactors.

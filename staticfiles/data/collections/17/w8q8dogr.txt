Background Pilonidal disease is a morbid condition of the young population, that could impair quality of life with a high cost for the health care system. No consensus exists on optimal surgical treatment, even if several techniques have been proposed. In this preliminary case-control study we compared excision by knife and diathermy to investigate if wound dehiscence could be related to heat spreading during excision of the sinus. Materials and method Between January 2017 and February 2018, 29 patients underwent to sinus excision.16 patients underwent sinus excision by diathermy (named "Hot" group, case-group) while 13 patients underwent excision by the knife as the control group (named "Cold" group). The temperature data were recorded for both groups. Were considered primary and secondary outcomes. Results the cold group has worse outcomes in operative time and blood loss, but better results in post-operative pain at first day and first control, number of weekly and total dressings until healing, time for full wound recovery, days to return to work, patient feeling feedback and scar aspect. Wounds healed within 8-12 days were 84.6% in the Cold group and 18.8% in the Hot one. I° Dindo-Clavien complications were respectively 15.4% and 100.0% for the Cold and Hot group. No differences were recorded for II° Dindo-Clavien complications and in days of hospitalization. Conclusion cold excision of the sinus pilonidalis has better results both in terms of precarious healing and quality of life, probably because the tissues are not subjected to diathermocoagulation damage and therefore the healing occurs more quickly.

INTRODUCTION Parastomal hernia is a common complication following stoma creation. The surgical approaches included local repair by suture, stoma relocation and mesh-based techniques; but none has been able to provide satisfactory results. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 60-year-old asian female was referred complaining of abdominal pain and constipation caused by recurrent parastomal hernia of an end stoma. She had undergone total cystectomy with creation of an ileal conduit at the age of 53 years, and laparoscopic sigmoid colostomy at the age of 55 years. Parastomal hernia of an end stoma had developed postoperatively, and she had undergone recreation of colostomy at the same place with fasciorrhaphy at the age of 59 years, but parastomal hernia recurred 6 months later because of split fascia sutures. Laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia was conducted using the sandwich technique while preserving an ileal conduit. The patient has been followed postoperatively for more than 3 years without any sign of recurrence. DISCUSSION Although further cases are required to get definitive conclusions, we suppose that the laparoscopic sandwich technique can be useful for parastomal hernia. CONCLUSION We herein report a case of recurrent parastomal hernia treated laparoscopically while preserving an ileal conduit using the sandwich technique which combines the keyhole and Sugarbaker techniques. This is a quite rare case report of laparoscopic repair for recurrent parastomal hernia in a patient with an ileal conduit.

Legionnaires' disease is a common cause of non-zoonotic atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Legionnaires' disease has varied manifestations but may be diagnosed clinically on the basis of its characteristic pattern of extra-organ involvement. In a patient with non-zoonotic CAP, the clinical and laboratory features in a patient with CAP pointing to the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease include relative bradycardia, mental confusion/ encephalopathy, loose stools/diarrhea, abdominal pain, mild/transient increases in serum transaminases, decreased serum phosphorous, a highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), highly elevated serum ferritin levels, or microscopic hematuria. The radiologic manifestations of Legionnaires' disease are varied and no radiographic appearance is pathopneumonic. Patchy infiltrates in Legionnaires' disease are symmetrical and rapidly progressive even on appropriate anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy. Spontaneous unilateral pneumothorax is a rare radiographic manifestation of Legionnaires' disease. We present a case of a young male who is presenting clinical finding was that of spontaneous bilateral pneumothoraces due to Legionella CAP. We believe this is the first reported case of Legionnaires' disease presenting as spontaneous bilateral pneumothoraces. Clinicians should be aware of the protean radiological manifestations of Legionnaires' disease. In patients presenting with CAP and unilateral or bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax, clinicians should have Legionnaires' disease in the differential diagnosis.

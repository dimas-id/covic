This chapter provides a description of the components of disease prevention and control programs, and then focuses on information systems designed to support public health surveillance, epidemiologic investigation of cases and outbreaks, and case management. For each such system, we describe sources used to acquire necessary data for use by public health agencies, and the technology used to clean, manage, organize, and display the information. We discuss challenges and successes in sharing information among these various systems, and opportunities presented by emerging technologies. Systems to support public health surveillance may support traditional passive case-reporting, as enhanced by electronic laboratory reporting and (emerging) direct reporting from electronic health records, and also a wide variety of different surveillance systems. We address syndromic surveillance and other novel approaches including registries for reporting and follow-up of cases of cancer, birth defects, lead poisoning, hepatitis B, etc., and population-based surveys (such as BRFSS or PRAMS). Systems to support epidemiologic investigation of outbreaks and clusters include generic tools such as Excel, SAS, SPSS, and R, and specialized tool-kits for epidemiologic analysis such as Epi-Info. In addition to supporting outbreak investigation, agencies also need systems to collect and manage summary information about outbreaks, investigations, and responses. Systems to support case management, contact tracing, and case-based disease control interventions are often integrated to some degree with surveillance systems. We focus on opportunities and choices in the design and implementation of these systems.

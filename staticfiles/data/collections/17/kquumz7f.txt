A 30-year-old male with cerebral palsy and motor impairment presented with right femur fracture. He had gradually worsening mobility and contractures of all extremities for the preceding 5 years. Evaluation showed multiple vertebral and femoral fractures, severe osteoporosis, a large parathyroid adenoma, and parathormone (PTH) exceeding 2500 pg/mL. Because of poor general health and high anesthetic risk, parathyroidectomy was deemed impractical. Ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) helped achieve 50% size reduction and PTH levels with better control of hypercalcemia. Later, as calcium and PTH remained elevated, percutaneous ethanol ablation was performed with resultant normalization of PTH and substantial symptomatic improvement. Two years later, he still remains normocalcaemic with normal PTH levels. We propose that RFA and percutaneous ethanol ablation be considered as effective short-term options for surgically difficult cases, which could even help achieve long-term remission. Although not previously reported, our case illustrates that both RFA and percutaneous ethanol ablation could be safely performed successively achieving long-term remission.

Abstract The number of patients returning from or staying abroad is likely to increase in the future. We performed a retrospective study of patients returning from abroad in our travel clinic in Japan. All patients presenting within 6 months of traveling abroad between 2004 and 2014 were included in the present study. A total of 2374 (mean age, 35 years) patients were seen by doctors specializing in treating infectious diseases. Of these, 918 were females and 87 of them lived abroad. Diagnoses and exposure regions were recorded for all patients. The most frequent region visited before attending our clinic was Southeast Asia (n = 1050, 44%), with a median duration for staying abroad of 8 days. The major purposes for overseas travel were tourism (n = 1302, 55%) and business (n = 684, 29%). Of the 2399 individual diagnoses made, the most frequent were diseases of the gastrointestinal system (n = 1083, 45%), skin and soft tissue (n = 440, 18%), systemic febrile disease without specific systems (419, 18%), and the respiratory system (353, 15%). The relative incidences of specific diseases changed drastically due to significant disease outbreaks, such as pandemic influenza in 2009. Exposure regions remained relatively constant throughout the study period, except for Japan. Vaccine-preventable diseases accounted for 5.3% of all the diseases, and 402 (26%) patients received pre-travel consultation and prophylaxis with vaccines and/or anti-malarial drug. We should make an effort to make more people notice the risk of travel and properly perform prophylaxis.

PURPOSE N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) glue is a valuable liquid embolic agent for the endovascular treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVM). The use of NBCA carries a risk of embolic agent reflux and distal migration with ensuing possibility of venous drainage compromise. The aim of this technical note is to describe a single center case series of high-flow intranidal fistulas embolized though a dual lumen balloon under local flow-arrest conditions. METHODS This article presents a retrospective description of a case series including five NBCA injections through a dual lumen balloon performed by a single operator in three patients with BAVM. Demographic, clinical, imaging and procedure-related data are reported. RESULTS The three patients presented with ruptured BAVMs. Of the patients, one underwent proximal flow-related ruptured aneurysm coiling before planned BAVM embolization. In the three patients, staged BAVM embolization as a first line treatment was decided. Preliminary embolization of high-flow BAVM fistulas by NBCA using a dual lumen balloon under local flow-arrest conditions was performed and five separate injections were carried out without any complications. No balloon entrapment or rupture was observed. CONCLUSION High-flow BAVM fistulas can be treated with NBCA embolization using a dual lumen balloon under local flow-arrest conditions.

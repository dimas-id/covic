Background and Aims Laryngoscopy and intubation cause sympathetic stimulation and arousal reactions. We evaluated the role of dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate on pressor responses to laryngoscopy and intubation as compared to placebo, when depth of anaesthesia was maintained at a constant bispectral index (BIS) range 40-50 (±5). Methods One hundred and twenty patients were randomised to receive either dexmedetomidine 1 μg/kg (Group DS), magnesium sulphate 30 mg/kg diluted in 100 ml saline (Group MS) or 100 ml normal saline (Group NS) 15 min before induction of anaesthesia in a double blind manner. After achieving BIS 40-50 (±5), laryngoscopy and intubation were performed. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded pre-drug, after drug, at intubation, at intervals of 1 min till 5 min, then every 2 min till 10 min and every 10 min for 30 min. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test and one way analysis of variance. Results SBP, DBP and HR fell in the DS and MS groups. No significant changes in BP were seen in the NS group at induction and after intubation. HR rose in the NS group (P < 0.001) at induction from 86.35 ± 9.05 to 95.35 ± 11.60 at 2 min. Patients in DS and MS groups had significantly lower HR, SBP and DBP at laryngoscopy and intubation. Conclusion At BIS levels 40-50 (±5) there was no pressor response to intubation in the NS Group. Dexmedetomidine and magnesium sulphate significantly reduced the heart rate and blood pressure from baseline.

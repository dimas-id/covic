A patient with a complete right ureteral triplication presented with recurrent pyelonephritis and flank pain that was refractory to medical management. Evaluation showed that the atrophic upper-most renal moiety had been chronically obstructed and was associated with a dilated ureter. Intraureteral and intravenous indocyanine green (ICG) were used as real-time contrast agents intraoperatively to facilitate right robotic partial nephroureterectomy of the diseased system. Intraureteral ICG was used to accurately distinguish the pathologic ureter and associated renal pelvis from its normal counterparts. Intravenous ICG was used to assess perfusion in the right kidney and delineate the margins of diseased renal parenchyma.

Abstract Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a universal technology for aptamer' screening. Accurate and efficient screening methods and strategy design are the key to success. This review briefly summarizes capillary electrophoresis (CE) involving in the efficient screening for aptamers in our group since 2007, including the application of CE in pre-screening, screening and post-screening process, classification and screening strategies against different protein targets, multiple screening modes, and screening for multi-scale targets. Finally, combined with the current progresses of aptamer screening, some remaining issues are discussed and the development prospects are proposed.

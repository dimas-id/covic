The isolation of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) in The Netherlands raised questions about its contribution to respiratory illness. In this study, a total of 525 respiratory specimens, collected in Canada primarily during the winter months of 2001–2002, were tested for HCoV-NL63; 19 tested positive for HCoV-NL63, demonstrating virus activity during January–March 2002. Patients with HCoV-NL63 were 1 month-100 years old (median age, 37 years). The main clinical presentations were fever (15/19), sore throat (5/19), and cough (9/19), and 4 patients were hospitalized. These results provide evidence for the worldwide distribution of HCoV-NL63.

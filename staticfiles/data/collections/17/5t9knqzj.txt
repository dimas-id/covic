PURPOSE To report the histological outcomes of a case of bilateral severely resorbed posterior maxilla augmented with the use of blocks of enzymatically deantigenated equine bone. MATERIALS AND METHODS In conjunction with bilateral sinus lifts, blocks of enzymatically deantigenated equine bone were used bilaterally to augment the severely atrophic maxilla of a patient seeking a fixed implant-supported prosthesis. After 8 months, bone core samples were obtained from the augmentation sites and implants were placed. RESULTS Six months after implant placement, the peri-implant bone levels were maintained. A prosthesis delivered 3 months after implant placement provided excellent rehabilitation. Histological analysis of the bone cores revealed that the graft material was still undergoing remodeling, with newly formed vital bone in all fields and osteoclasts included in the mineralized component. CONCLUSIONS The deantigenated equine bone was biocompatible and resorbed only minimally. This material seems to offer excellent potential for being incorporated in a procedure that increases the width of edentulous alveolar crests.

[Chemical structure: see text] Environmentally benign oxidation methods satisfy the postulates of green chemistry. Heterocyclic Noxides have applications in synthetic organic chemistry, chemotherapy and agrochemicals. Synthesis of Noxides using green oxidants will be attractive over the conventional methods. The presence of the N‐oxide group in the azine ring makes it more subject to electrophilic and nucleophilic attack and substantially expands the synthetic approaches for the modification of nitrogen‐containing heterocyclics. That is the reason for the increasing interest in the chemistry of heterocyclic N‐oxides. Some reactions adopted for oxidation of N‐heterocyclics have been discussed. Stereochemical and spectroscopic aspects have been mentioned. It will be advantageous if anchored catalysts are employed for industrial exploitation. Several physiochemical aspects of various methods have been discussed.

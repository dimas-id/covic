The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak, first reported in Wuhan, China, is gradually spreading worldwide. For diagnosis, chest computed tomography is a conventional, noninvasive imaging modality that is very accurate for detection and evaluation of pneumonia and is an important adjunct to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction diagnosis of the virus. Previous studies have reported typical computed tomography imaging features indicative of COVID-19, such as multifocal ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation. With the sharply increasing demand for computed tomography examination during the outbreak, ensuring appropriate infection control in radiology departments is challenging. Thus, advanced training and education in standardized infection control and prevention practice are essential. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize such training and education for clinical management of this outbreak for radiology department personnel. We will describe standard transmission-based precautions, workflow for computed tomography examination of fever patients, and decontamination management of a radiology department.

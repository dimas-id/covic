This study's aim was to discern the nursing organizational culture and job stress, induced by infection control nurses (ICNs)’ working together, affects ICNs’ turnover intentions. Job stress was the most significant factor affecting ICNs’ turnover intention. To reduce ICNs’ turnover intention, their task stress needs to be lowered and managed. In particular, efforts should be made to establish a relation-oriented organizational culture that values positive relationships while enhancing their community spirit at the organization level.

An intelligent agent refers to an autonomous entity directing its activity towards achieving goals, acting upon an environment using data obtained with the help of a sensory mechanism. Intelligent agent software is a software system that performs tasks independently on behalf of a user in a networking environment based on user interface and past experiences. By the design of an intelligent sensing software program we can regulate the flow of traffic in a transportation infrastructure network. The problems leading to inefficiencies like loss of time, decrease in safety of vehicles and pedestrians, massive pollution, high wastage of fuel energy, degradation in the quality of life can be achieved by the optimized design. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) has proven to be a very powerful optimization model for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm has the objective of regulating high real time traffic enabling every vehicle in the network with increased efficiency to minimize factors like time delay and traffic congestion.

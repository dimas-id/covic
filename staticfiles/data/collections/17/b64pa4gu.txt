An electron microscopic study was carried out on specimens of feces and intestinal contents from cases of canine gastroenteritis submitted to the Diagnostic Laboratory, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, during 1979-1981. The majority of samples came from New York State and the Northeast with no marked shift in distribution over the three year period. Canine parvovirus was the major virus identified. In August and September 1980 there was an epidemic of canine gastroenteritis, with 247 samples received during this two month period alone, of which 48 percent were positive for canine parvovirus. Almost half of the total number of specimens examined were from dogs less than 6 months of age and well over 50 percent of these were parvovirus positive. In addition to canine parvovirus, three cases of coronavirus, two cases of rota-like virus and one case of astro-like virus were detected. Three dual infections with canine parvovirus and rota or astro-like virus were also confirmed. An unidentified virus-like particle with cubic symmetry was found in two specimens. The adoption of immunoelectron microscopy for the detection of canine parvovirus in March 1980 facilitated identification of this virus and greatly increased the sensitivity of the technique.

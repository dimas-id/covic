The burn center in our hospital is a national and regional (Southeast Asia) center. Of all admissions, 10% are related to blast explosions, and 8% due to chemical burns. In the acute burn management protocol of Singapore General Hospital, early surgical debridement is advocated for all acute partial-thickness burns. The aim of early surgical debridement is to remove all debris and unhealthy tissue, preventing wound infection and thereby expediting wound healing. In chemical burns, there can be stubborn eschars that are resistant to traditional debridement. We would like to present a novel technique using the diathermy scratch pad as a cheap and efficient tool for the dual purpose of surgical debridement and dermabrasion.

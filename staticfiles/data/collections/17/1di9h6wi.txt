Clinical molecular laboratory professionals are at the frontline of the response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, providing accurate, high-quality laboratory results to aid in diagnosis, treatment, and epidemiology. In this role, we have encountered numerous regulatory, reimbursement, supply-chain, logistical, and systems challenges that we have struggled to overcome to fulfill our calling to provide patient care. In this Perspective from the Association for Molecular Pathology Infectious Disease Subdivision Leadership team, we review how our members have risen to these challenges, provide recommendations for managing the current pandemic, and outline the steps we can take as a community to better prepare for future pandemics.

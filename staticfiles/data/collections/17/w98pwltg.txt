The sharp increase in antibiotic resistance imposes a global threat to human health and the discovery of effective antimicrobial alternatives is needed. The use of probiotics to combat bacterial pathogens has gained a rising interest. Pathogenic Escherichia coli is causative of multiple clinical syndromes such as diarrheal diseases, meningitis and urinary tract infections. In this work, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotics to control multidrug-resistant E. coli and reduce their ability to form biofilms. Six E. coli resistant to at least five antibiotics (Ceftazidime, Ampicillin, Clarithromycin, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic Acid and Ceftriaxone) were isolated in this work. Preparations of cell-free spent media (CFSM) of six probiotics belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus which were grown in Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth exhibited strong antibacterial activity (inhibition zones of 11.77â€“23.10 mm) against all E. coli isolates. Two E. coli isolates, namely E. coli WW1 and IC2, which were most resistant to all antibiotics were subjected to antibiofilm experiments. Interestingly, the CFSM of MRS fermented by all probiotics resulted in inhibition of biofilm formation while B. longum caused highest inhibition (57.94%) in case of E. coli IC2 biofilms and L. plantarum was responsible for 64.57% reduction of E. coli WW1 biofilms. On the other hand, CFSM of skim milk fermented by L. helveticus and L. rhamnosus exhibited a slight inhibitory activity against IC2 isolate (inhibition percentage of 31.52 and 17. 68, respectively) while WW1 isolate biofilms was reduced by CFSM of milk fermented by B. longum and L. helveticus (70.81 and 69.49 reduction percentage, respectively). These results support the effective use of probiotics as antimicrobial alternatives and to eradicate biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant E. coli.

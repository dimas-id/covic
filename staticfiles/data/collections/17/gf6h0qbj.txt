Lung injury can occur secondary to a myriad of causes, including infection, immunologic disorders, drug toxicity, or inhalational injury among others. Although the list of causative agents is long, the lung’s response to injury is limited resulting in similar patterns of disease irrespective of the cause. From a pathological perspective, acute lung injury refers to a group of entities that present with acute or subacute disease. These conditions are characterized by particular histological patterns including diffuse alveolar damage, acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia and clinically correspond to the varying degrees of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Patel et al, Chest 125:197–202, 2004; Beasley et al, Arch Pathol Lab Med 126:1064–1070, 2002; Avecillas et al, Clin Chest Med 27:549–557, 2006; Cottin, Cordier, Semin Respir Crit Care Med 33:462–475, 2012; Ferguson et al, Intensive Care Med 38:1573–1582, 2012). In most cases, the underlying cause will not be apparent from the histological findings requiring close correlation with clinical history and laboratory findings to determine the etiology. Nevertheless, careful search for infectious organisms with application of histochemical and immunohistochemical stains should be performed in all cases in order to identify cases that benefit from more targeted treatment.

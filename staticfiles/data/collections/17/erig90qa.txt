BACKGROUND Post-acute pancreatic collections (PAPCs) may require intervention when persistent, large or symptomatic. An open cystgastrostomy is an effective treatment option particularly for larger, solid predominant collections. A laparoscopic cystgastrostomy (LCG) as initially described, could be technically challenging. This report describes the evolution of the operative technique and the results from LCG in a tertiary referral centre. METHODS Retrospective analysis of the unit's prospectively populated database was conducted. All patients who underwent a surgical cystgastrostomy (SCG) were identified. Patient demographics, outcome and complications were collected and analysed. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent SCG: 8 open and 36 laparoscopic. Of the 36 LCG, 6 required open conversion, although with evolution of the technique all of the last 17 cases were completed laparoscopically. The median interquartile range (IQR) length of stay in patients completed laparoscopically was 6 (2-10) compared with 15.5 days (8-19) in those patients who were converted (P = 0.0351). The only peri-operative complication after a LCG was a self-limiting upper gastrointestinal bleed. With a median (IQR) follow-up of 891 days (527-1495) one patient required re-intervention for a residual collection with no recurrent collections identified. CONCLUSION LCG is a safe and effective procedure in patients with large, solid predominant PAPCs. With increased experience and technical expertise conversion rates can be lowered and outcome optimized.

We have read with great interests a recent article showing SARS‐CoV‐2 viral RNA in feces of children during their recovery period from the disease.(1) The study showed that even though no viral nucleic acid was detected in the throat swab specimens, the virus was identified in their feces samples. More recently, Li et al(2) and Liu et al.(3) detected the virus nucleic acid in the feces and sputum of discharged patients of the disease following quarantine protocol in their homes.

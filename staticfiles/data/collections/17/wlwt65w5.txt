Objective To evaluate the clinical experience of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment on two cases of infection with the critical Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) complicated by fulminant myocarditis (FM) Methods This study selects two COVID-19 cases comorbid with fulminant myocarditis and had been treated with ECMO in Shenzhen Third People's Hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 We compare the index of inflammation, immunization, D-dimer and lactic acid before and after ECMO treatment in 24 and 96 hours, cardiopulmonary function before and after ECMO treatment in 24, 48, 72, 96 hours, We also analyze the complications and clinical outcomes of the two cases during the ECMO treatment Results Both patients were elderly obese men with chronic cardiopulmonary disease Comparing the laboratory test results and imaging data of the two patients, the acute lung injury score, oxygenation index, albumin level, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels in 2 patients after ECMO treatment were improved as compared with those before ECMO treatment Finally, case 1 died of multiple organ failure and his cardiac function continued to deteriorate, while, case 2 successfully withdrew and his cardiac function gradually improved Conclusions For critical COVID-19 patients with fulminant myocarditis, ECMO treatment can improve pulmonary function in the short term, provide valuable time for rescuing COVID-19 patients with fulminant myocarditis

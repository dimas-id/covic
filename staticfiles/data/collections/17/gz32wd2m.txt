Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Patients with AD have increased infection risk, including skin infections and systemic infections. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin‐4 (IL‐4) and IL‐13. Dupilumab is approved for inadequately controlled moderate‐to‐severe AD.(1)

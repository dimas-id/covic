In vitro, lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) infection of flounder gill (FG) cell cultures causes obvious cytopathic effect (CPE). We describe attempts to isolate and characterize the LCDV-binding molecule(s) on the plasma membrane of FG cells that were responsible for virus entry. The results showed that the co-immunoprecipitation assay detected a 27.8 kDa molecule from FG cells that bound to LCDV. In a blocking ELISA, pre-incubation of FG cell membrane proteins with the specific antiserum developed against the 27.8 kDa protein could block LCDV binding. Similarly, antiserum against 27.8 kDa protein could also inhibit LCDV infection of FG cells in vitro. Mass spectrometric analysis established that the 27.8 kDa protein and beta-actin had a strong association. These results strongly supported the possibility that the 27.8 kDa protein was the putative receptor specific for LCDV infection of FG cells.

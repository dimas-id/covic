Combined immunodeficiency syndrome is an inherited disorder of the Arabian breed of horses. Affected foals usually die of infectious disease within the first few months of life, and the respiratory tract is the commonest site of infection. This report describes the clinical and pathological features of a case which showed signs of alimentary and respiratory infections. Intestinal infection by coronavirus (not previously recorded in cases of the syndrome) and cryptosporidia was identified. Histopathological evidence also suggested the presence of an adenovirus infection.

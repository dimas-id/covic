BACKGROUND Stent-assisted coiling is a commonly adopted technique employed in the coiling of broader-based aneurysms. It avoids flow arrest and the risk of vessel rupture associated with balloon-assisted coiling. However, there is a risk of stent thrombosis with the corollary risk of stroke during and after the procedure. Antiplatelet agents are used to mitigate this risk but raise a secondary concern of hemorrhagic complications, particularly with ruptured aneurysm where further interventions such as ventriculostomy occur not infrequently. Stent removal after coil embolization would eliminate the risk of post-procedure stent thromboembolic complications and alleviate the need for continuing antiplatelet therapy. METHODS A prospectively maintained endovascular database was searched to identify patients who underwent stent-assisted coil embolization followed by stent retrieval and removal. The clinical and technical aspects of the cases were obtained in addition to the procedural outcomes. RESULTS Three cases were identified where the use of the fully resheathable Solitaire AB Neurovascular Remodeling Device permitted the coiling of broad-based aneurysms with subsequent retrieval and removal of the stent. All patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and received aspirin prior to the procedure. Two patients did not require antiplatelet therapy after the procedure. No coil herniation or thromboembolic events were encountered. CONCLUSIONS Stent retrieval and removal can be done safely in selected cases at the end of stent-assisted coil embolization using the Solitaire AB device. This technique avoids the need for continuing antiplatelet therapy, which can be particularly important in the setting of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.

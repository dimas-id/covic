The influence of the somatostatin analogue angiopeptin on transplant arteriosclerosis was investigated using two aortic transplantation rat models. One was characterized by ischemia/reperfusion-induced changes in syngeneic transplants while immunologically induced changes dominated in the other allogeneic model. Angiopeptin, 100 μg/kg per day, was administered continuously until the sacrifice of the rats after 8 weeks. No additional immunosuppression was used in either model. An image analysis system was used to quantify the intimal and medial thicknesses of the grafts. In the syngeneic grafts, the intimal thickness was less than 50% of that of control grafts (P<0.05), but no difference was seen in the allogeneic model. The expression of selected cells, TGF-βs and PDGF and PDGF α-receptors was detected immunohistochemically and displayed a similar picture in control and angiopeptin-treated grafts in both models. We conclude that angiopeptin has no clear immunosuppressive properties but may counteract ischemia-induced transplant arteriosclerosis.

The term “liver insufficiency” denotes a break down in the functions of the liver. The syndrome of functional liver failure covers a wide spectrum of clinical, biochemical and neurophysiological changes. In principle, liver insufficiency can occur without previous liver damage as well as with already existing liver disease. It is characterized by a deterioration in the synthesizing, regulatory and detoxifying function of the liver. This final stage of liver disease terminates in hepatic coma.

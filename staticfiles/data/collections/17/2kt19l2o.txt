Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies are important in dermatology, but indications are influenced by SARS-CoV-2. We will focus on skin disorders such as autoimmune connective tissue disorders, neutrophilic dermatoses, and vasculitis. Immunomodulators such as colchicine and antimalarials can easily be preferred taking their beneficial effects on COVID-19 into consideration and also given their wide spectrum of action. Among the conventional therapies, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil increase the risk of infection, and thus their use is recommended only when necessary and at low doses. On the other hand, use of cyclosporine is also not recommended as it increases the risk of hypertension, which is susceptible to COVID-19. Anti-TNF agents from among the biological therapies appear to be slightly risky in terms of susceptibility to infection. However, there are ongoing studies which suggest that some biological treatments may reduce cytokine storm impeding the COVID-19 progression as a result, in spite of their susceptibilities to COVID-19. Patients, who will be started on immunosuppressive therapy, should be tested for COVID-19 prior to the therapy, and in the event that COVID-19 is suspected, the therapy should be discontinued.

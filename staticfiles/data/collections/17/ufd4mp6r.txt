The article of Galván Casas et al. describing the cutaneous manifestations occurring during the COVID‐19 pandemic(1) prompted us to make some observations. Informations regarding the prevalence of enanthems, their clinical features and the association with exanthem patterns and disease severity are lacking. In the absence of a clearly defined temporal connection, the relationship between exanthems and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is at times unclear, as in the case of urticarial/maculopapular eruptions in patients undergoing treatment with multiple drugs.

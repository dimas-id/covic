A 7‐month‐old‐intact male domestic shorthair cat was presented with fever, anterior uveitis in the right eye and respiratory distress when handled. These signs along with mild changes in serum protein levels and the exclusion of other potential causes were suggestive of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). As the disease progressed, more clinical signs consistent with FIP, including renal involvement and later pleural effusion, became evident. Non‐pruritic cutaneous lesions, characterized by slightly raised intradermal papules over the dorsal neck and over both lateral thoracic walls, were recognized at the end stage of the disease. The identification of papules in well‐haired skin was difficult, and clipping of the fur facilitated their detection. Definitive diagnosis of FIP was made by histopathology and by immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen in macrophages within kidney and skin lesions. The case was classified as a mixed form of FIP. Recognition of associated cutaneous lesions may facilitate a diagnosis of FIP in suspicious cases.

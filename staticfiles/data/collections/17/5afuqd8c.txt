Reported here are the findings of a comparative study on the effects of using a Socratic Intelligent Tutoring System for source code comprehension and learning computer programming. The result shows there are significant differences between the two groups where students who used Socratic Tutor ITS improved their knowledge by 45% in term of learning gain, developed a better understanding of concepts such as nested if-else and for loop, and improved their confidence level by 13%. Furthermore, the result of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient shows a positive correlation (r = 0.68) between feedback from the ITS and learning gain.

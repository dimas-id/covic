Adherence of the population to COVID-19 prevention recommendations is crucial to control the epidemic. However, a study of communication messages around COVID-19 in 15 West African countries showed a number of unfounded messages, as well as a lack of communication on critical information to understand the prevention measures being promoted. Incidents of violence that have taken place recently suggest that general mistrust and hostility could grow, similar to the events that occurred during the previous Ebola epidemics. It is therefore urgent to review and revise the COVID-19 communication messages currently used in sub-Saharan Africa.

The high prevalence of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and inefficient preventive measures taken to curb the disease are significant public health concerns. Rapid and innovative advances in digital media offer opportunities for health education, which could result in increased preventive behaviors. This study assessed preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 and tested mediation pathways linking four types of digital media consumption (social media, mobile social networking apps [MSNs], online news media, and social live steaming services [SLSSs]) to preventive behaviors, mediated by worry. Results from an online survey (N = 511) revealed that the vast majority (>90 percent) of respondents had very often or always practiced preventive behaviors against contracting COVID-19 such as washing their hands more regularly with soap and water, staying away from crowded places, and wearing face masks out in public. In addition, COVID-19 information seeking through the four types of digital media was a salient parameter that encouraged people to practice preventive behaviors either directly or indirectly. Specifically, seeking COVID-19-related information on MSNs, SLSSs, and online news media was directly associated with preventive behaviors. Whereas COVID-19 information consumption on social media, MSNs, and SLSSs during the infectious disease outbreak could elicit intense worry and, in turn, increase preventive behaviors. The reasons for and implications of the results are discussed.

PURPOSE: COVID-19 as a pandemic calls for rapid development of vaccines. METHODS: Here a proposal of a seamless, adaptive, phase 1-3 trial for accelerated vaccine development is described. RESULTS: Starting at 10, the number of vaccinated volunteers would exponentially increase by tenfold at an interval of 2 weeks; close surveillance of antibody responses, safety and efficacy is necessary. After only 16 weeks, general vaccination would be feasible if supply meets the demand. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 vaccine would be rapidly available at a slightly increased risk for undetected late side effects or insufficient efficacy if compared with standard vaccine development schemes.

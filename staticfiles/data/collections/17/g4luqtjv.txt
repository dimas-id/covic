Information about the clinical presentation and course of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. Data are emerging from retrospective clinical studies conducted in Wuhan, China, showing the symptoms and characteristics of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic data on COVID-19 cases reveal bilateral opacities on chest radiography and ground-glass opacities on computed tomography. Data on laboratory markers and mortality and morbidity are also emerging.

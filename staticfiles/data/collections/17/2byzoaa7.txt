BACKGROUND Global prevalence of obesity has soared. Where lifestyle and medical treatments have failed, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is increasingly regarded as a good surgical procedure for morbid obesity. Following the introduction of LSG, we assessed our surgical outcomes. METHODS We reviewed a consecutive series of LSGs from January 2009 to January 2015. Our primary focus was to assess the success of this procedure on the percentage excess body weight loss (%EWL), Body Mass Index (BMI), hypertension and diabetes. Additionally, we evaluated the rate of procedure-related complications. RESULTS There were 183 consecutive patients evaluated. Median age was 45 years (24-73). The majority were female (73.2 %, n = 134). At 1 year post-op, median %EWL was 57.6 %. There was an associated median reduction in BMI of 16 kg/m2 (0-33). At 2 years, median %EWL was sustained at 58.4 %. The median reduction in BMI was 16 kg/m2 (4-32). At 2-year post-op, 78.9 % of diabetic patients had their diabetic medications completely discontinued, while a further 15.8 % having their medication reduced. 34.6 % of hypertensive patients had their antihypertensives discontinued, with 50 % having medications reduced. There was no procedure related mortality. 3.3 % (n = 6) of patients had a confirmed staple-line leak. CONCLUSION This study shows LSG is a safe and successful management strategy for morbid obesity. In addition to the direct effects of sustained weight loss, it highlights indirect effects that LSG has on obesity-related health issues, with substantial reduction in diabetic and anti-hypertensive medications. Our results reaffirm international studies of the beneficial effects of LSG on Type II diabetes and hypertension.

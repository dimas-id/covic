Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a highly contagious, life-threatening condition with unprecedented impacts for worldwide societies and healthcare systems. Since the first detection in China, it has spread rapidly worldwide. The increased burden has substantially impacted the neurosurgery practice and intensive modifications were required in surgical scheduling, inpatient and outpatient clinics, management of emergency cases, and even academic activities. In some systems, non-overlapping teams were created to minimize transmission among healthcare workers. In case of a massive burden, neurosurgeons may be needed to reassign to the COVID-19 wards, or teams from other regions may be needed to send to severely affected areas. In outpatient practice, if possible, appointments should be turned into telemedicine. All staff assigned in the non-COVID treatment unit should be clothed in level 1 personal protective equipment. If possible, postponement is recommended for operations that do not require urgent or emergent intervention. All patients indicated for surgery must receive a COVID-19 screening, including nasopharyngeal swab, and thorax computed tomography. Level 2 protection measures would be appropriate during COVID-19 negative patients' operations. Operations of COVID-19 positive patients, and emergency cases, where screening can not be obtained, should be performed following level 3 protective measures. During surgery, the use of high-speed drills and electrocautery should be reduced to minimize aerosol production. Screening is crucial in all patients since the surgical outcome is highly mortal in COVID-19 patients. All educational and academic conferences can be turned into virtual webinars.

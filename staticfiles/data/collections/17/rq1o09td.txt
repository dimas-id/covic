• Although severe multisystemic manifestations have been defined in adults, there is limited data on the disease burden of COVID-19 in infants and children. • We present the case of a 15-day-old infant who was born with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and was found to be COVID-19 positive on day 7 of life. • Although the majority of children with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic, among symptomatic children, 5% have dyspnea or hypoxemia, and 0.6% progress to acute respiratory distress or multi organ dysfunction. • In the face of this sustained public health crisis, the concomitant occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 with pediatric congenital heart disease may become more and more common; guidance on appropriate management of patients in such a situation is imperative to ensure patient safety.

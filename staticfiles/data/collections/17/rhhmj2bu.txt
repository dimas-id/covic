OBJECTIVES Real-world, prospective, long-term studies in Crohn's disease (CD) characterizing adalimumab safety data and lymphoma risk were lacking. We present the final results from the PYRAMID registry, which was designed to rule out a doubling of lymphoma risk in adalimumab-treated patients with CD. METHODS Patients with moderately to severely active CD newly prescribed or currently receiving adalimumab according to local product labels were followed for up to 6 years and analyzed for adverse events (AEs). The registry exposure-adjusted observed rate of lymphoma was compared with the estimated background lymphoma rate from a sex-matched general population in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 17 Registry database adjusted for anticipated prior or concurrent thiopurine use in a CD population. RESULTS A total of 5025 patients were evaluated (16680.4 PY of adalimumab registry exposure, â‰ˆ3 years/patient mean follow-up). Registry treatment-emergent AEs included 4129 serious AEs (n = 1853 [36.9%]; 24.8 E/100 PY), 792 serious infections (n = 556 [11.1%]; 4.7 E/100 PY), and 134 malignancies (n = 116 [2.3%]; 0.8 E/100 PY), including ten lymphomas. The observed lymphoma rate (0.060 E/100 PY) was lower than the estimated background rate (0.084 E/100 PY), and the upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI of the observed rate (0.102 E/100 PY) was lower than double the estimated rate (0.168 E/100 PY). CONCLUSIONS PYRAMID is the longest prospective adalimumab study in routine clinical practice, with up to 6 years of follow-up. No new safety signals were reported. The pre-specified registry objective of ruling out a doubling of lymphoma risk with adalimumab was met.

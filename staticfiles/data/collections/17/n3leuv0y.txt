Flow diversion has revolutionised the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, and the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) remains the only flow diverter (FD) approved in the USA. However, thromboembolic events remain an issue for FDs. Attempting to minimise these incidents, a newer PED has been developed with the use of covalent bonding of phosphorylcholine onto the Pipeline device that has been known as Shield Technology (PED Shield), which in vitro has demonstrated a significant reduction in material thrombogenicity. We report the first US experience of the PED Shield in the treatment of a ruptured fusiform aneurysm located in the right vertebral artery in an attempt to mitigate complications related to the use of dual-antiplatelet therapy and discuss our rationale for using the new FD, using aspirin only as the antiplatelet regimen.

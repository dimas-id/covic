Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Emerging evidence showed that lncRNAs play important roles in a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. The infection of virus generally can regulate the expression of the cellular lncRNA expression. The lncRNAs which encoded by virus can also modulate the expression of the hosts' gene which is critical for virus infection. Here, we summarized the recent progress on long noncoding RNA and its relationship with virus, especially the function of long noncoding RNA on virus-induced oncogenesis. Studies on lncRNAs and their relationship with viruses may give new insights into virus-host interactions and therapy of related diseases.

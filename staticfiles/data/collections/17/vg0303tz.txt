At present, the prevention and control of COVID-19 in China has entered a critical period. Recently, various areas outside Hubei Province have gradually begun to resume work and production, but the development of the epidemic situation is still uncertain and complex. A few days ago, researchers gradually began to pay attention to asymptomatic infection of 2019-novel coronavirus and described the disease process of asymptomatic infection and the possibility of being a source of infection. This provided a scientific basis for further optimizing and improving epidemic prevention and control measures. Paying attention to the screening and self-protection of high-risk groups and strengthening the level of detection should be helpful to the detection and management of asymptomatic infection.

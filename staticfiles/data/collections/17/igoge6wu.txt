In March 2020, we treated a cohort of 26 critically ill hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who underwent electroencephalography to assess unexplained altered mental status, loss of consciousness, or poor arousal and responsiveness. Of the 26 patients studied, 5 patients had electroencephalograms that showed periodic discharges consisting of high-amplitude frontal monomorphic delta waves with absence of epileptic activity. These findings may suggest central nervous system injury potentially related to COVID-19 in these patients. ANN NEUROL 2020.

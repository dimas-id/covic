Porcine epidemic diarrhea has become pandemic in the Asian pig-breeding industry, causing significant economic loss. In the present study, 11 complete genomes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field isolates from China were determined and analyzed. Frequently occurring mutations were observed, which suggested that full understanding of the genomic and epidemiological characteristics is critical in the fight against PEDV epidemics. Comparative analysis of 49 available genomes clustered the PEDV strains into pandemic (PX) and classical (CX) groups and identified four hypervariable regions (V1 to V4). Further study indicated key roles for the spike (S) gene and the V2 region in distinguishing between the PX and CX groups and for studying genetic evolution. Genotyping and phylogeny-based geographical dissection based on 219 S genes revealed the complexity and severity of PEDV epidemics in Asia. Many subgroups have formed, with a wide array of mutations in different countries, leading to the outbreak of PEDV in Asia. Spatiotemporal reconstruction based on the analysis suggested that the pandemic group strains originated from South Korea and then extended into Japan, Thailand, and China. However, the novel pandemic strains in South Korea that appeared after 2013 may have originated from a Chinese variant. Thus, the serious PED epidemics in China and South Korea in recent years were caused by the complex subgroups of PEDV. The data in this study have important implications for understanding the ongoing PEDV outbreaks in Asia and will guide future efforts to effectively prevent and control PEDV.

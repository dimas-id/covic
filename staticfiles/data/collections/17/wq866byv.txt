Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, planned medical and surgical activities are being postponed. For the dermatology community, this interruption to the healthcare system can lead to delays in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma. Neglecting melanoma during this crisis can result in increased mortality, morbidity and healthcare costs. With the COVID-19 pandemic evolving and no clear solutions in sight, it is time for the prospective evaluation of teledermatology. However, dermatologists should be cautious and continue seeing patients with pigmented lesions in person due to the necessity of early surgical intervention.

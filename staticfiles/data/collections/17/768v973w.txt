Abstract Acute exacerbation is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Although the real nature of it is still not clear and there is no proven effective therapy, progress has been made since the consensus definition and diagnostic criteria were proposed. The trial results of several new innovative therapies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have suggested a potential for benefit in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, leading to double blind randomized clinical trials in this area. This article reviews the present knowledge on acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, focusing on the triggering factors and treatment.

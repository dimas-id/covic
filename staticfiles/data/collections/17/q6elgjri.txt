BACKGROUND The application of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for advanced procedures in children is logical. However, the intracorporeal placement and tying of suture can be challenging, leading to prolonged anesthesia and morbidity. We describe our initial experience with the use of a novel unidirectional barbed knotless suture (V-LOC, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) that permits a safe and efficient advanced MIS reconstruction in infants and children. METHODS From August 2010 to February 2012, 11 infants and children underwent diaphragmatic reconstruction utilizing either the absorbable or the permanent V-LOC suture. Data retrieval included gender, weight, diagnosis, operative time, complications and follow up. RESULTS Thoracoscopic or laparoscopic repairs were carried out in all children. Two of the infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia of Bochdalek (CDH) developed a recurrence at 4 and 6 months of age and required reoperation. There were no other complications or recurrence in the remaining 9 children, and there were no mortalities in the group. CONCLUSION This is the first study to evaluate the use of the unidirectional barbed knotless suture in pediatric surgery. We demonstrate that the use of the V-LOC barbed suture is an innovative, safe and time saving option for pediatric MIS. Prospective analysis with long-term follow-up is required to confirm these initial results and to ascertain if this novel approach can be utilized in other pediatric surgical conditions.

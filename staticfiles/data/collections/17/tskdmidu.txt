Abstract Background The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 associated infections as a global health public emergency that has led to more than 3,50,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 infections are seen across all age groups but they have shown to have a predisposition for the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities. Specifically, these include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and underlying lung conditions. Further, patients with severe COVID-19 infections and comorbidities are more prone to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mechanical ventilator use and ultimately succumb to these complications. Little evidence exists of the prevalence of underlying lung comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and associated mortality. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature including PubMed (Medline), Embase (Ovid), Google Scholar and Cochrane Library. The last date for our search was 29th April 2020. We included all original research articles on COVID-19 and calculated prevalence of chronic lung disease patients among COVID-19 patients using random effects model. Further we assessed for mortality rates among COVID-19 patients associated with these lung comorbidities. We calculated pooled prevalence of these conditions among COVID-19 patients using random effects model. Results The authors identified 29 articles that reported the prevalence of chronic lung conditions among COVID-19 patients. Among those, 26 were from China and 3 from the United States. The pooled prevalence of lung comorbidities including Asthma, COPD, and lung cancer was 3% (95% CI=0-14%), 2.2% (95% CI=0.02-0.03%) and 2.1% (95% CI=0.00-0.21%) respectively. Mortality rates associated with these comorbidities was 30% (41/137) for COPD and 19% (7/37) for lung cancer respectively. No mortality rates were reported for patients with asthma. Conclusion This study provides preliminary evidence of the prevalence of chronic lung conditions among patients with COVID-19. Future studies are needed to assess other lung comorbidities and associated mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

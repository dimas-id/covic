We read with interest the study by Lei and colleagues on the association between markers of liver injury and mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in China. The authors have painstakingly collated data from a large number of COVID‐19 patients from multiple centers across Wuhan. They found that an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and its dynamicity correlated with COVID‐19‐related liver injury and patient outcomes. They concluded that the dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators, represented by AST, correspond with COVID‐19‐related liver injury.

Information on treatment of COVID-19 infection in renal transplant recipients is scarce, especially in symptomatic patients and patients with recent major clinical events. This group of patients suffers from different opportunistic infections which may coexist with COVID-19. Currently available expert opinions suggest reduction of immunosuppression therapy for renal transplant recipients with symptomatic COVID-19 infection with either antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin. Inspired by our experience in treatment of CMV pneumonia and literature data on the potential benefit of convalescent plasma for treatment of different viral diseases we suggest use of the hyperimmune anti-CMV gamma globulins in addition to other available therapies. Besides the immunosuppression reduction which is supposed to be beneficial, immunoglobulins with their immunomodulatory effects and possible antiviral role, may increase a possibility for favorable outcome.

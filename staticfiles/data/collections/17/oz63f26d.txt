As the world accommodates to the COVID-19 pandemic, routine in-person medical services are resuming. The resumption of non-urgent electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing faces unique challenges due to the long duration of the procedure and direct close contact with patients, including studies with risk of exposure to oropharyngeal secretions. We provide consensus guidance for resumption of EDX testing, addressing scheduling, patient arrival and registration, use of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 screening and testing, the performance of EDX in outpatient and inpatient settings, cleaning and maintenance of the EDX equipment and laboratory, balancing trainee safety and training requirements, and patient care issues. These are broad recommendations which need to be adapted to local COVID-19 risks, institutional guidelines and policies, and changing federal, state and local regulations, and to changes in the pandemic over time.

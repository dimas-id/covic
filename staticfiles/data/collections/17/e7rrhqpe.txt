In this study, cDNA of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7 and 9 were synthesized and completely sequenced. The coding regions of cDNA for bat TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 were 2,718, 3,150 and 3,090 bp in length, respectively. The open reading frames encoded 905, 1,049 and 1,029 amino acids for TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, respectively. The nucleotide sequences, predicted amino acid sequences and predicted domain structures of the three bat TLRs had high homology with those of other mammals. In addition, the expression profiles of each TLR in main organs were analyzed. Expression of TLR3 was highest in the liver, whereas the expressions of TLR7 and TLR9 were highest in the spleen.

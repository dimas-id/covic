PURPOSE: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease with high mortality. The agent causing CCHF is a Nairovirus. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through tick bites. CCHF is a life-threatening disease observed endemically over a wide geographical regions in the world and a little known about pulmonary findings in CCHF patients. METHODS: The patients that were admitted and diagnosed with CCHF between April 2010 and September 2015 were examined. Patients’ medical records were then evaluated retrospectively. Patients who underwent thorax CT evaluation based on the clinical findings at the time of admission and/or during the hospital stay were included in the study. Patients’ laboratory test results and thorax CT findings for respiratory assessment along with demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Forty patients diagnosed with CCHF that underwent thorax CT based on their indications were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients (62.5 %) were male with a mean age of 55.22 ± 19.84 years. According to these results, the three most common thorax CT findings were parenchymal infiltration [32 patients (80 %)], pleural effusion [31 patients (77.5 %)], and alveolar infiltration [28 patients (70 %)]. Moreover, we determined that the most frequently seen radiological findings often occurred bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: There is still not enough information regarding this life-threatening disease. We also would like to emphasize that both direct radiography and thorax CT are highly successful in detecting frequently encountered radiological findings such as pleural effusion, alveolar hemorrhage, and parenchymal infiltration that indicate pulmonary involvement.

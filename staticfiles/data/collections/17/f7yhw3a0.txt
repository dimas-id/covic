Italy has been one of countries most affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic and the Government instituted a strict national lockdown on 9 March 2020 to limit the spread. Healthcare services were only open for emergencies or undelayable needs. This study describes the impact of the lockdown on the tertiary level Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, in Trieste, North East Italy. It is the only PED in the city and sees 25,000 patients aged 0‐17 annually.

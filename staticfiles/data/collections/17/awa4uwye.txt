With the outbreak of COVID-19, patients and providers were forced to isolate and become innovative in ways to continue exceptional patient care. The Cleveland Clinic went from mostly in-person medical appointments to all virtual/telemedicine care in about 2 weeksâ€™ time.

Additionally, we discuss the importance of innovating the training and supervision of postdoctoral trainees using telepsychology and virtual options.

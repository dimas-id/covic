Of the reemergent transmissible diseases of the past decades, SARS is probably not the last to express the alterations occurring in the relationships of the human being with its global ecosystem. The life of contemporary man is characterized, among others, by a huge thirst for traveling, for varied reasons, consequence of the globalization process. SARS virus, mutant belonging to Coronaviridae, occurred in one of the most densely populated areas of the world. There are two main moments marking the reemergence and evolution of SARS: firstly, the onset of the epidemic in China in November 2002 followed by the worldwide spread of the epidemiological process, and secondly the discovery of SARS virus as a mutant of coronaviruses in March-April 2003 in USA, Canada, and Hong Kong. The possibilities of general and special prevention, and particularly vaccine prevention are likely to bring this disease under control.

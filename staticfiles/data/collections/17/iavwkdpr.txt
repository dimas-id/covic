We introduce a new evaluation lab named ChEMU (Cheminformatics Elsevier Melbourne University), part of the 11th Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF-2020). ChEMU involves two key information extraction tasks over chemical reactions from patents. Task 1—Named entity recognition—involves identifying chemical compounds as well as their types in context, i.e., to assign the label of a chemical compound according to the role which the compound plays within a chemical reaction. Task 2—Event extraction over chemical reactions—involves event trigger detection and argument recognition. We briefly present the motivations and goals of the ChEMU tasks, as well as resources and evaluation methodology.

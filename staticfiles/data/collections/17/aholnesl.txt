BACKGROUND Recurrence is the most important complication of abdominal wall reconstruction. It is possible the repair itself is intact, but bulging or expansion of mesh causes recurrent swelling's of the abdominal wall. CASE SUMMARY In this report, we present bulging of a polyester mesh due to central pore expansion. DISCUSSION Repetitive stress and variations in intra-abdominal pressure can change tensile strength and stretches mesh materials. CONCLUSION A swelling after abdominal wall repair can be caused by bulging of the mesh. A progressive bulging might be the result of failure of the mesh implant due to elongation. Mesh characteristics should be considered when choosing a feasible and suitable mesh for abdominal wall reconstruction. Clinical distinction between recurrent hernia and mesh bulging is difficult but therapeutically irrelevant in symptomatic patients.

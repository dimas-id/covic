Abstract Aptamers are nucleic acid ligands that are generated artificially by in vitro selection and behave similar to antibodies. The development of aptamer-based sensing systems or strategies has been in vogue for the past few decades, because aptamers are smaller in size, stable, cheaper and undergo easier modifications. Owing to these advantages, several facile aptamer-based colorimetric strategies have been created by controlling the assembly and disassembly of aptamers on unmodified gold nanoparticle probes. As these kinds of assay systems are rapid and can be visualized unaided by instruments, they have recently become an attractive method of choice. The formation of purple-colored aggregates (attraction) from the red dispersed (repulsion) state of GNPs in the presence of mono- or divalent ions is the key principle behind this assay. Due to its simplicity and versatility, this assay can be an alternative to existing diagnostic assays. Here, we have investigated the critical elements involved in colorimetric assays, and have screened different proteins and small ligands to evaluate biofouling on GNPs.

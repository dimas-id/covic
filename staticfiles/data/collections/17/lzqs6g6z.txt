Multiple epizootics of typhlocolitis associated with high morbidity and mortality occurred among suckling mice in an arbovirology research laboratory. Affected mice had necrosis and hyperplasia of cecal, colonic, and less often, small intestinal mucosa. Epithelial syncytia were present throughout the affected areas. Other organs generally were not involved. The etiologic agent was a coronavirus antigenically related to mouse hepatitis virus strains 1 and S. Sera from dams of affected litters and recovered animals did not contain detectable complement fixing antibody to coronavirus antigen. The lesions and the causative agent differed from previously reported coronaviral syndromes in mice. The source of the infection was not definitely found.

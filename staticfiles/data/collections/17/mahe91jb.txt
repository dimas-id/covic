This chapter reports the applicability of ionic liquids in the formation of different types of multicomponent reactions. Easy work-up, relatively short reaction times, good to high yields of the desired products, mild reaction conditions, low cost, availability, and reusability of the employed ionic liquids are the striking Â­features of the reported methodologies.

Abstract Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this scenario, managing acute medical conditions, such as stroke, requires a timely treatment together with proper strategies that minimize the risk of infection spreading to health care workers and other patients. We report the case of a 79-year-old woman, who was admitted for a wake-up stroke due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. She was treated outside the COVID-19-dedicated track of the hospital because she had no concomitant signs or symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor recent contact with other infected individuals. Post-mortem nasal and pharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose that hyperacute stroke patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission and then managed as having COVID-19 until cleared by a negative result. We are aware that such measure results in some delay of the acute treatment of stroke, which could be minimal using well-exercised containment protocols.

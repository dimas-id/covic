PURPOSE We compared the results of hypospadias repair using polyglytone versus polydioxanone to evaluate the potential benefit of using a suture with a rapid absorption time. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 100 patients 8 to 24 months old affected by distal isolated penile hypospadias were considered for this study. Patients were randomized and assigned to 2 different groups according to the suture material used during the surgical procedure (tubularized incised plate repair with or without preputial reconstruction). Polyglytone was used in group A and polydioxanone was used in group B. All patients were evaluated at 4 intervals (1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 2 years postoperatively). Persistence of sutures on penile skin, urethral fistulas, skin dehiscence, infection and skin tracks were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. RESULTS Followup data documented the absence of significant differences in terms of urethral fistula rate, skin dehiscence and acute skin infection. Persistence of sutures and multiple skin tracks at long-term followup were significantly greater in patients in group B. CONCLUSIONS Both sutures are adequate for hypospadias surgery in small children. The use of a rapid absorption monofilament may allow much more rapid disappearance of the skin sutures. In the long term this outcome means almost complete absence of suture tracks. No statistically significant difference in terms of urethrocutaneous fistula was observed, suggesting that the tensile strength of polyglytone is adequate.

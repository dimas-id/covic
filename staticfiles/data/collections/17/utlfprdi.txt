The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and evolution of mild dilatation confined to the renal pelvis in term neonates with urinary tract infection developing within 2 weeks from birth. Twenty-two neonates with mild dilatation of the renal pelvis out of 180 neonates with urinary tract infection were identified giving an incidence of 12.2% for this finding. Male to female ratio was 6.3:1. The left kidney was twice as frequently involved (68 vs. 32%). At follow-up, the dilatation had disappeared in 20 neonates (90.9%) by a mean age of 2.7 years with only one neonate developing two further episodes of urinary tract infection in the infantile period. No other morbidity was noted.

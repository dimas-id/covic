BACKGROUND Cataract is the leading cause of blindness and low vision worldwide. Presently, cataract surgery is the only treatment for cataract and is very effective in restoring sight. In cataract surgery, the natural lens of the eye that becomes clouded is removed and replaced with an artificial intraocular lens. There are multiple techniques for removal of lens as well as many types of intraocular lenses available for implantation. For this reason, it becomes imperative to monitor the impact of different surgical techniques and different intraocular lenses on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of the patients. This systematic review aims to evaluate HRQoL evidences on effects of different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses on visual function and quality of life in age-related cataract patients. METHOD Databases like Cochrane, EMBASE, SCOPUS, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov , Current Controlled Trials and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) will be searched systematically. Two reviewers will independently screen studies using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria along with the extraction of data, and assessment of methodological quality using a standard checklist. DISCUSSION This systematic review will help in understanding how different types of cataract surgeries and intraocular lenses make a difference on quality of life of age-related cataract patients in terms of visual function and health-related quality of life. As the review attempts to bring together all the cataract-related HRQoL evidences pertaining to different cataract surgical techniques, different intraocular lenses and cataract-related complications, it will also identify gaps in evidence.

Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) includes inner BRB (iBRB) and outer BRB (oBRB), which are formed by retinal capillary endothelial (RCEC) cells and by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells in collaboration with Bruchâ€™s membrane and the choriocapillaris, respectively. Functions of the BRB are to regulate fluids and molecular movement between the ocular vascular beds and retinal tissues and to prevent leakage of macromolecules and other potentially harmful agents into the retina, keeping the microenvironment of the retina and retinal neurons. These functions are mainly attributed to absent fenestrations of RCECs, tight junctions, expression of a great diversity of transporters, and coverage of pericytes and glial cells. BRB existence also becomes a reason that systemic administration for some drugs is not suitable for the treatment of retinal diseases. Some diseases (such as diabetes and ischemia-reperfusion) impair BRB function via altering tight junctions, RCEC death, and transporter expression. This chapter will illustrate function of BRB, expressions and functions of these transporters, and their clinical significances.

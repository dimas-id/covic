Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which is based on the dual mechanisms of restriction and mal-absorption, is considered to be one of the gold standard surgeries for treatment of morbid obesity. However, the classic laparoscopic approach requires five to seven incisions for multiple trocar placement. Recently, single incision laparoscopic surgery has been adopted for performing appendectomies, cholecystectomies, sleeve gastrectomies, and adjustable gastric band surgeries. Here, we described the first case of a patient receiving laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass through a single transumbilical incision. The operative time was 170 min. There were no intra-operative complications; the patient did very well postoperatively and was discharged 2 days later. Single incision laparoscopic surgery has been viewed as an alternative to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. When performed via the transumbilical route, it can make the abdominal wound scarless and cosmetically more acceptable.

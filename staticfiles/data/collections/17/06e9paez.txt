OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to propose a classification of surgical techniques for treatment of prolapse by vaginal route using prosthetic reinforcements and to relate the evaluation of surgeons involved in the care of surgical patients. METHODS A literature review was conducted searching for all articles relating novel technique of surgical management of patients with use of prosthetic reinforcements vaginally. The classification was made from descriptions found and then assessed by questionnaires filled out by surgeons. RESULTS The classification takes account of all the techniques available today and can integrate new. Among the surgeons, 56.5% (13/23) found that the POP-ST is adapted to reflect the reality and variety of techniques and 60.8% (14/23) will be ready for daily use. CONCLUSION A classification covering all the techniques put them at risk of a final tool too complex for routine use. The simplification would make it more usable but limited the comprehensiveness and evolutionary. Only 23 surgeons returned the questionnaire. A larger sample would be desirable. The POP-ST is the first classification of this type. We believe that it would assess the new techniques to better understand the complications.

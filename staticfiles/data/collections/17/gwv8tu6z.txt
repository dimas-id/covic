A total of 763 fecal or intestinal samples from diarrheic calves and piglets were examined for viral content by immunofluorescence, electron microscopy or cell culture. Routine fluorescent antibody and cultural tests detected rotavirus (n=126), coronavirus (n=80) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (n=13). Electron microscopy detected rotaviruses (n=24) and coronaviruses (n=17) not identified by standard fluorescent antibody tests. Other viruses detected by electron microscopy included Breda virus-like particles (n=49), astroviruses (n=1), caliciviruses (n=1), rhabdoviruses (n=1), parvoviruses (n=2), enteroviruses (n=3), togavirus-like particles (n=2), and "chained" particles (n=5). Mixtures of several of the viruses were detected in a number of fecal samples.The survey emphasized the value of electron microscopy as a broad-spectrum diagnostic tool.

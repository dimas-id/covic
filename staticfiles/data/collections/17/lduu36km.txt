BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak of worldwide, we aim to analyze the laboratory risk factors of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: All &#8805;18-year-old patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 3 to February 20, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed up until March 20, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and explored the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 73 severe patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 20 (27%) patients died in hospital during the average 28 days of follow-up period. The median age of non-survivors was significantly older than survivors (69 [64-76.5] years vs 64 [56-71.3] years, P = .033) and 15 (75%) patients were males. The laboratory abnormalities of non-survivors mainly presented in serious inflammation response and multiple organ failure, with high levels of cytokines and deranged coagulation parameters. Multivariable regression showed that neutrophil count greater than 4.47 Ã— 109 /L (OR, 58.35; 95%CI: 2.16-1571.69; P = .016), hypersensitivity C-reactive protein greater than 86.7 mg/L (OR, 14.90; 95%CI: 1.29-171.10; P = .030), creatine kinase greater than 101 U/L (OR, 161.62; 95%CI: 6.45-4045.20; P = .002), and blood urea nitrogen greater than 6.7 mmol/L (OR, 11.18; 95%CI: 1.36-91.62; P = .024) were risk factors for in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: The risk factors of neutrophil count, hypersensitivity C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, and blood urea nitrogen could help clinicians to early identify COVID-19 severe patients with poor outcomes on admission. Virus direct attack and cytokine storm play a major role in the death of COVID-19.

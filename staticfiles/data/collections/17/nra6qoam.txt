Abstract Coronaviruses possess a distinctive morphology, the name being derived from the outer fringe, or “corona” of embedded envelope protein. Members of the family Coronaviridae cause a broad spectrum of animal and human diseases. Uniquely, replication of the RNA genome proceeds through the generation of a nested set of viral mRNA molecules. Until 2003, coronaviruses attracted little interest beyond causing mild upper respiratory tract infections. This changed dramatically in 2003 with the zoonotic SARS-CoV and the more recent emergence of MERS-CoV has confirmed the coronaviruses as significant causes of severe respiratory disease.

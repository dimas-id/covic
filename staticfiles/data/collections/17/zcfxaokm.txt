Objective Osteoid osteoma, which is observed in the adolescent and young adult population as benign bone tumors, appears as a single nidus with a diameter < 2 cm and is treated with open surgery. However, technological advances in medicine have made it possible to apply less invasive procedures in surgery. Methods Between 2006-2014, 24 patients < 18 years of age were treated for osteoid osteoma. Patient demographic data, surgical data, complications, and recurrences were noted. Results Twenty-four patients (mean age, 11 [2-18] years) were treated and followed up for a mean 3.58 (range, 1-9) years. Mean patient age in the curettage group was 12.1 (range, 3-18) years. Mean operation length was 69.5 (range, 60-120) minutes. Mean hospital stay was 1.3 (range, 0-2) days. Mean patient age in the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) group was 10.7 (range, 2-17) years. Five patients were female and 8 were male. Mean operation length was 49.6 (range, 20-90) minutes. Mean hospital stay was 0.3 (range, 0-1) days. Mean follow-up time was 1.76 (range, 1-4) years. Mean operation length, hospital stay, and follow-up were significantly shorter in the RFA group. Conclusions Considering reduced costs due to shorter hospitalization periods and the ability to reach anatomically difficult locations, percutaneous procedures are likely to replace the conventional open approach. Level of evidence: II, retrospective study.

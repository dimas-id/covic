The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of four travel risk factors (natural disaster risk, physical risk, political risk, and performance risk) on traveler groups with different characteristics and the relationship among these risk factors, travel satisfaction, and travelers’ repurchase intention. For the research purpose, this study analyzed the data from passengers of a major international airline. The results suggest that traveler groups with different characteristics (gender, airline seat class, travel purpose, travel destination, travel duration, travel companion, and income level) respond differently to some risk factors, while they show the same response to other risk factors. The results also show that each risk factor affects travel satisfaction and repurchase intention differently. These findings imply that airlines should develop different strategies based on risk factors and travelers’ characteristics.

BACKGROUND Totally laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) is preferred over open gastrectomy because it allows safe anastomosis, a small wound, and early bowel recovery. However, esophagojejunostomy (EJS) following laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) remains technically challenging. To popularize LTG, a secure method of reconstruction must be developed. We present a simple and safe technique for intracorporeal EJS following LTG. METHODS Our modified technique for intracorporeal EJS as a part of Roux-en-Y reconstruction following LTG incorporates an isoperistaltic stapled EJS with closure of the entry hole using two unidirectional barbed sutures. First, a side-to-side isoperistaltic EJS is created between the dorsal and left side of the esophagus and the jejunal arm. Second, the opening for the stapler is closed with a two-layer continuous suture using two 15-cm 3-0 V-Loc suture devices. The full-thickness inner layer closure commences from the sides of the staple lines and progresses toward the center of the enterotomy. During suturing, the remaining thread is utilized to apply tension and lift the enterotomy. Once the full-thickness layer closure is complete at the center of the enterotomy, suturing of the second seromuscular layer is started in the forward direction toward each corner to give a crossover-shaped suturing line. RESULTS From February 2012 to October 2017, 27 patients with gastric cancer underwent LTG with intracorporeal stapled EJS as a part of Roux-en-Y reconstruction. All procedures were successfully performed without any intra- or postoperative anastomosis-related complications. No conversion to other procedures was required. The mean suturing time was 19.1 Â± 9.5 min. The mean postoperative time to tolerating a liquid diet was 3.3 days, and the mean hospital stay was 12.1 days. CONCLUSIONS We herein report our procedure for intracorporeal EJS using a linear stapler and barbed sutures. This technique is simple and feasible and has acceptable morbidity.

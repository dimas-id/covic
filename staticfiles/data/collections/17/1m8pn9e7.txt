Objectives To evaluate the intra- and postoperative gastrointestinal complications following abdominal sacrocolpopexy and determine the possible causes. Methods A total of 86 patients who underwent abdominal sacrocolpopexy due to symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse between January 2014 and January 2016 at Ä°zmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic were retrospectively reviewed using the hospital information system. Patients were divided into two groups: those with and without prolonged length of hospital stay. They were evaluated in terms of gastrointestinal complications and risk factors. Results The reason for prolonged hospitalization was nausea and vomiting in 24 (88%) of 27 patients. The symptoms in these patients were recovered with hydration, stopping of oral intake, and administration of antiemetics. Nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition were required in three (11%) patients due to clinical and radiological evidence of ileus. The parameter that significantly prolonged the length of hospital stay was prior abdominal surgery (p < 0.05). Conclusion There were obvious gastrointestinal complications in three out of 27 patients with prolonged length of hospital stay. These findings may be beneficial for preoperative patient counselling.

BACKGROUND In liver surgery, clamp-crushing (CC) procedure has been shown to be the most efficient system for liver transection. Recently, it has been suggested that radiofrequency-assisted liver resection (RFALR) may be more advantageous, but sufficient evidence has yet to be accumulated. METHOD The control group was constituted by 32 patients undergoing CC liver transection. The study group included 13 patients undergoing RFALR with a new fully automated radiofrequency generator supplying a comb-shaped bipolar multielectrode device. RESULTS RFALR allowed a faster hepatic transection and reduced both surgical time and intraoperative blood loss. RFALR was the only independent prognostic indicator of bleeding during liver transection. No significant liver damage and postoperative complications, particularly biliary leakage and stenosis, were experienced in the RFALR group. CONCLUSION Compared with the CC procedure, this bipolar device was shown to be safe and effective in liver resections, allowing a very clean surgical field without increase of postoperative complications.

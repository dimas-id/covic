Abstract In times of global pandemics, the self-protection of medical personnel is of paramount importance. Faced with the worldwide supply shortages of medical equipment, we have designed a simple, effective splash protection made of medical packaging. Because of the ease of manufacture and the instructions published in this technical note, we hope that healthcare professionals worldwide will be able to protect themselves against infectious fluids with an intubation dome.

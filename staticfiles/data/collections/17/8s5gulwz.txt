INTRODUCTION This multimedia video is the second part of our study on transanal endoscopic radical resection of the rectum, which we have previously described (http://links.lww.com/DCR/A4). In this present study, we hypothesized that this procedure is not only technically feasible but also safe. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE This procedure was performed on two swine as a surviving model. After radical resection of the rectum and primary anastomosis, the two swine were monitored in an animal holding area for a period of 1 week, and the anastomoses were inspected after that period. The lower rectum was transected, and retroperitoneal dissection was performed transanally using flexible endoscopic equipment to achieve high ligation of the caudal mesenteric vessels. After rectal resection, hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis was performed. DISCUSSION Both swine had good postoperative outcomes, and the postoperative period was captured on video. Transanal radical endoscopic resection of the rectum is not only technically feasible, but it can can be safely performed on swine.

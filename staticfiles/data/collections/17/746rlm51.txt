This chapter addresses the factors involved in recovery from infection. Antibody and cellular responses (CMI) are considered. The mechanisms by which antibodies neutralise viruses/prevent infection are described, as is the involvement of antibody in bacterial and protozoal diseases. The role of CMI in recovery from specific bacterial, protozoal and viral infections is considered. The mechanisms of cell killing by cytotoxic T-cells is described and the role of NK cells and macrophages in pathogen clearance is discussed, as is the role of inflammation. Mechanisms by which the complement system acts and its role in vivo is discussed, as is the interferon response. Recovery from S. typhimurium is used to illustrate the multimechanistic nature of recovery. The role of temperature in recovery and pathogen factors that induce fever are considered. Tissue repair mechanisms are discussed, as is finally resistance to infection.

PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) offers excellent cosmetic results and may be associated with decreased postoperative pain and accelerated recovery. Although there have been reports of cholecystectomy and appendectomy using SILS, there have been few reports of gastric resection with intracorporeal reconstruction of the digestive tract using SILS. The first single-incision laparoscopic gastrectomy with intracorporeal reconstruction is reported. METHODS Preliminary experience with single-incision laparoscopic gastrectomy with intracorporeal reconstruction for a patient with an intractable gastric ulcer is reported. RESULTS Single-incision laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction were performed. Operative time for gastrectomy and paraduodenal hernioplasty was 412 minutes, and blood loss was 90 g. No intraoperative or postoperative complications developed. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy for intractable gastric ulcer is technically feasible. Intracorporeal reconstruction of the digestive tract was performed safely using a linear endoscopic stapler. This surgical approach is a further advance toward scarless surgery of the stomach.

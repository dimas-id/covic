PURPOSE: To give an overview of the current knowledge about COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on otolaryngology clinical practice. METHODS: Recent findings about SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 infection it causes are reviewed. In addition to international databases and in the absence of hard scientific data, literature search included reports published online from scientific societies and other institutions. RESULTS: The role of anosmia as a COVID-19-related symptom is presented. Further, considerations about steroid administration in ENT-related conditions are also discussed. Due to the close work with mucosa surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract, otolaryngologists and surrounding staff are considered high risk for coronavirus transmission. Hence, staff protection measures for ENT examinations, surgeries and other procedures during COVID-19 pandemic are recommended. CONCLUSION: Knowledge and evidence about the impact of COVID-19 infection on otolaryngology clinical practice are accumulating rapidly. Additionally to patientâ€™s management, safety of health care professionals should be a main goal right now by following strict safety guidelines.

As of April 9, 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) had caused 89,931 deaths and 1,503,900 confirmed cases worldwide, which indicates an increasingly severe and uncontrollable situation. Initially, little was known about the virus. As research continues, we have learned the genome structure, epidemiological and clinical characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2. Based on these discoveries, identifying potential targets involved in the processes of virus pathogenesis is urgently needed, and discovering or developing promising drugs based on potential targets is the most pressing need. Therefore, we summarize the potential therapeutic targets involved in virus pathogenesis and discuss the advancements, possibilities and significance of promising drugs based on these targets for treating SARS‐CoV‐2. This review will facilitate the identification of potential targets and provide promising clues for drug development that can be translated into clinical applications for combating SARS‐CoV‐2.

BACKGROUND AND AIM The manner in which colorectal lesions are being detected with PillCam COLON2 capsule endoscopy (CCE2) has markedly improved in recent days. However, limited data are available on CCE2 for detecting laterally spreading tumors (LSTs). The aim of this study was to compare CCE2 with optical colonoscopy (OC), which is currently the gold standard used in the detection of LSTs. METHODS We performed a prospective, single-academic center study comparing CCE2 with OC in patients with LSTs diagnosed using OC, which was performed during the 3-month period prior to CCE2. We focused on the sensitivity and specificity of CCE2 for detecting LSTs. LSTs were classified into the LST-granular type (LST-G) or the LST-non-granular type (LST-NG). RESULTS Thirty patients (mean age 59.5 years) were enrolled. Of them, 21 LSTs (7 LST-Gs and 14 LST-NGs) were evaluated in this study. The mean diameter of the LSTs was 27 Â± 15 mm (range 10-60 mm). Histopathological diagnoses of the LSTs were as follows: tubular adenoma, 12 cases (57%); sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P), 4 cases (19%); Tis carcinoma, 1 case (5%); and T1 carcinoma, 4 cases (19 LSTs were found in the following locations: cecum, 1 case (5%); ascending colon, 6 cases (29%); transverse colon, 6 cases, (29%); descending colon, 1 case (5%); sigmoid colon, 3 cases (13%); and rectum, 4 cases (19%). The colon cleansing level was adequate in all cases. The sensitivity and specificity of CCE2 for detecting LSTs were 81 and 100% respectively. For detecting LST-Gs and LST-NGs, the sensitivity and specificity were 71 and 100%, and 86 and 100%, respectively. There were 4 false-negative cases (LST-G (18 mm), cecum; LST-G (20 mm), sigmoid colon; LST-NG (25 mm), transverse colon; LST-NG (20 mm), transverse colon). CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity for detecting LSTs is lower with CCE2 than it is with OC, especially for LSTs located on the right colon or for SSA/P.

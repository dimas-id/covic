Lacaziosis is a cutaneous chronic mycosis caused by Lacazia loboi. Macrophages are important cells in the host immune response in fungal infections. The macrophage population exhibits strong plasticity that varies according to the stimuli in the microenvironment of lesions M1 profile promotes a Th1 pattern of cytokines and a microbicidal function and M2 is related to Th2 cytokines and immunomodulatory response. We investigated the population of M1 and M2 polarized macrophages in human cutaneous lesions. A total of 27 biopsies from human lesions were submitted to an immunohistochemistry protocol using antibodies to detect M1 and M2 macrophages (Arginase-1, CD163, iNOS, RBP-J and cMAF). We could observe high number of cells expressing Arginase1, CD163 and c-MAF that correspond to elements of the M2 profile of macrophage, over iNOS and RBP-J (elements of the M1 profile). The results suggest a predominant phenotype of M2 macrophages, which have an immunomodulatory role and probably contributing to chronicity of Lacaziosis.

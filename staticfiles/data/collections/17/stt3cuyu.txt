Cecal diverticulum of colon is a relatively rare and benign condition in the western world. The reported frequency is approximately 1 in 300 appendectomies. They are usually asymptomatic but it may cause inflammatory, hemorrhagic, or perforatory complications. It is often clinically indistinguishable from acute appendicitis. The diagnosis is almost made intraoperatively. We present a 21-year-old female patient who admitted to our emergency unit with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed due to suspicious acute appendicitis. During exploration, an inflammatory mass originated from cecum was noticed. Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed due to suspicious malignant mass. The postoperative course was uneventful. Although radiologic techniques are improved; the diagnosis of solitary cecal diverticulum is difficult. The choice of surgical therapy is controversial. The therapy is ranged from a simple diverticulectomy to right hemicolectomy. Diagnostic laparoscopy can help the surgeon in the diagnosis of right lower quadrant pain and therapy of solitary cecal diverticulitis.

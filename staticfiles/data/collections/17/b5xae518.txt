As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to gain momentum around the world, several measures are being put in place to control its spread. One such effort includes the installation walkthrough sanitization gates to disinfect passersby and prevent cross infection. However, there is lack of clinical evidence on the effectiveness of these walkthrough gates to contain COVID-19. Moreover, there are potential public health concerns associated with these walkthrough gates. Spraying individuals with disinfectant chemicals is strongly discouraged by various health authorities around the globe because of their propensity for eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm following inhalation, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting. This article underscores that the risks associated with the use of these walkthrough gates overweigh any potential benefits. Health authorities must discourage their use and should focus efforts on other preventive measures such as social distancing, wearing masks, and hand hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the general public.

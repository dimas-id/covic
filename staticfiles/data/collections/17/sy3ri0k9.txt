Multisubunit protein complexes regulate numerous biologically important processes. Elucidation of their functional mechanisms based on their three-dimensional structures allows us to understand biological events at the molecular level. Crystallography and electron microscopy are powerful tools for analyzing the structures of biological macromolecules. However, both techniques require large-scale preparation of pure and structurally homogenous samples, which is usually challenging for large multisubunit complexes, particularly from eukaryotes. In this chapter, we describe the principles and methods of producing multisubunit complexes in insect cells using the MultiBac system.

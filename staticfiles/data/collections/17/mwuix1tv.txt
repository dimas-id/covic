Summary Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant respiratory tract infection in immunosuppressed patients. Aim To describe two consecutive yearly outbreaks of RSV in our haemato-oncology ward. Methods Haematology patients presenting with respiratory symptoms were screened by polymerase chain reaction for viral respiratory pathogens using a saline gargle. Findings None of our patients had undergone bone marrow transplant but all had underlying haematological malignancies. Eight patients were affected in the first outbreak (mortality rate: 37.5%) and 12 patients were affected in the second (mortality rate: 8.3%). Extensive infection control measures were implemented in both outbreaks and were successful in preventing further cross-transmission. Conclusion There was significant learning from both outbreaks and actions implemented with the aim of reducing the likelihood and impact of future outbreaks.

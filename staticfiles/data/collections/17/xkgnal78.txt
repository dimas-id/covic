PURPOSE LigaSure, a vessel sealing system, has been shown to have excellent hemostatic properties; however, its use for lung parenchymal resection has been limited. We herein examined the hemostatic properties and potential for inducing histological lung injury of the LigaSure system in non-anatomic pulmonary resection to estimate the feasibility of its clinical application. METHODS Non-anatomic pulmonary wedge resections of the right cranial, middle, and caudal lobes were performed in four pigs using the LigaSure system (Group A) or electrocautery (Group B). In each resection, the resection time, blood loss, and weight of the resected lung were measured. The thermal effect on the lung tissue was examined by means of intraoperative thermography and histology. RESULTS A total of 12 lung wedge resections were performed in each group. For an equivalent length of operation and weight of the resected lung parenchyma, Group A showed significantly lower blood loss and lower maximum and minimum temperatures of the lung tissue, as assessed by thermography, than Group B. The degree of thermal injury as estimated by a histological examination was lower in Group A than in Group B. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that the LigaSure system may be superior to conventional electrocautery, indicating its clinical usefulness for non-anatomic pulmonary resection.

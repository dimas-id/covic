This article has the purpose of examining the problem of getting help for the medical-psychiatric-substance use group of "homeless" people on the streets of our cities, who refuse treatment. The problem has gradually worsened since closure of state hospitals and subsequent lack of community resources. It has been stalemated, in part, by advocates, who argue for personal autonomy and freedom rather than involuntary diagnosis and treatment over the life of these people. It has reached a crisis situation secondary to such potential patients being imprisoned and/or sick with COVID-19 being potential health and legal threats. We review A) the nature of the problem, B) the current social-legal availability of treatment and long-term management (or lack of one) in the context of societal rejection of these potential patients, and C) suggest what might be done, locally and nationally. Mandating scientifically-based medical orders to citizens regardless of personal freedom - are now being implemented to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue for creating a similar med-psych short- and long-term system as a new approach to help this group. They are now mostly being ignored "to die on the streets."

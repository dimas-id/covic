Understanding the geographical distribution of COVID-19 through the general population is key to the provision of adequate healthcare services. Using self-reported data from 2,266,235 unique GB users of the COVID Symptom Tracker app, we find that COVID-19 prevalence and severity became rapidly distributed across the UK within a month of the WHO declaration of the pandemic, with significant evidence of urban hot-spots. We found a geo-social gradient associated with disease severity and prevalence suggesting resources should focus on urban areas and areas of higher deprivation. Our results demonstrate use of self-reported data to inform public health policy and resource allocation.

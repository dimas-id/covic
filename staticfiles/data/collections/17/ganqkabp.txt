Intraoperative manipulation causes circulating tumor cell (CTC) shedding into the blood and accelerates metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study was conducted to assess the degree of dissemination resulting from surgery and to explore the biological features of CTCs. In patients with NSCLC who underwent complete resection, the pulmonary vein (PV) was isolated and stapled following thoracotomy. The number of CTCs retained per 7.5 ml PV blood (CTC-PV) and peripheral blood were detected. Following hematopoietic cell depletion, a xenograft assay was performed using the CTC-PV. A total of 32 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study, the majority of whom had CTCs in their PV blood (n=29, 90.6%). Circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) were identified in 12 patients (37.5%). The CTC-PV and CTM-PV counts were positively correlated with tumor size (P=0.012 and P=0.028, respectively). Patients with small tumors (<3.0 cm) also had considerable CTC-PV and CTM-PV. A total of 8 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy prior to surgery. The CTC-PV and CTM-PV counts in patients with partial response were significantly lower than those in patients with stable disease or who did not receive induction therapy (P=0.025 and P=0.044, respectively). The enriched CTC-PV from 3 patients were injected into 3 immunodeficient mice, and 1 mouse developed a xenograft tumor. To conclude, the present study indicates that intraoperative manipulation contributes to the hematogenous dissemination of tumorigenic CTCs and CTM. Lobectomy is recommended for lung cancer of any tumor size and stage according to oncological principles, in addition to ligating the PV, if possible, prior to any other treatment.

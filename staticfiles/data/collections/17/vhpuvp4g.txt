Quantification and detection of various contaminants in the ecosystem have become critically important in the past few decades due to their exhaustive use in soil and aquatic ecosystems. The contamination by both organic and inorganic contaminants in the ecosystem has drawn attention due to their persistence, biological accumulation, and toxicity. Organic contaminants reach the air, water, food, soil, and other systems through drift mechanism and have detrimental effect on various life systems after entering the food chain, thus interfering the normal biological process of the ecosystem. Inorganic contaminants have less solubility, primarily get adsorbed, and accumulate on lower sediments. The sources of both organic and inorganic contaminants include anthropogenic activities which dispose industrial and sewage effluent directly into water bodies. Most of the contaminants are very much toxic and have tumorigenic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic effect on various life-forms. Biosensors have various prospective and existing applications in the detection of these compounds in the environment by transducing a signal. It also has immense applications in the detection of different contaminants in the food industry, environmental monitoring, disease diagnosis, etc. where reliable and precise analyses are required. This chapter points out a comprehensive glimpse on different biosensors and their characteristics, operating principles, and their designs, based on transduction types and biological components. Efforts have been made to summarize various applications of biosensors in food industry, environmental monitoring, drug delivery systems, and clinical diagnostics etc.

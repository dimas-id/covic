We present our experience in haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo SCT) in children with benign disorders. We performed a retrospective study where children aged up to 18 years diagnosed to have benign disorders and underwent haplo SCT from 2002 to September 2017 were included. Of the 54 children, the most common indications were Fanconi anaemia 12 (22%), severe aplastic anaemia 8 (14%) and primary immune deficiency disorders (PID) 25 (46%). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) was used in 41 (75.9%) and ex vivo T depletion in 13 (24.1%). Engraftment rates were 70% with acute graft versus host disease in 36% and cytomegalovirus reactivation in 55% children. There was a statistically significant difference found between survival with siblings as donors as compared to parents (p value 0.018). Overall survival was 60% which is the 1-year survival, with 68% survival among those with PIDs. Cytokine release syndrome was noted in 12/41 (29%) of children who received T replete graft and PTCy. In children over 6 months of age, PTCy at a cost of INR 1200 provides cost effective T cell depletion comparable with TCR α/β depletion priced at INR 1200,000. Haplo SCT is feasible option for cure in children with benign disorder.

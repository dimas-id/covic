Abstract Background It is unclear whether multiple respiratory viral infections are associated with more severe bronchiolitis requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. We aimed to identify the association between multiple respiratory viral infections and PICU admission among infants with bronchiolitis. Methods We performed a 1:1 case-control study enrolling previously healthy full-term infants (≤12 months) with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU as cases and those to the general pediatric ward as controls from 2015 to 2017. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for detection of the respiratory viruses. We summarized the characteristics of infants admitted to the PICU and the general pediatric unit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to fit the association between multiple respiratory viral infections (≥2 strains) and PICU admission. Results A total of 135 infants admitted to the PICU were compared with 135 randomly selected control infants admitted to the general pediatric unit. The PICU patients were younger (median: 2.2 months, interquartile range: 1.3–4.2) than the general ward patients (median: 3.2 months, interquartile range: 1.6–6.4). Respiratory syncytial virus (74.1%), rhinovirus (28.9%), and coronavirus (5.9%) were the most common viruses for bronchiolitis requiring PICU admission. Patients with bronchiolitis admitted to the PICU tended to have multiple viral infections compared with patients on the general ward (23.0% vs. 10.4%, P <0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bronchiolitis with multiple viral infections was associated with higher odds of PICU admission (adjusted odds ratio: 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.17–5.57, P =0.02). Conclusion Infants with multiviral bronchiolitis have higher odds of PICU admission compared with those with a single or nondetectable viral infection.

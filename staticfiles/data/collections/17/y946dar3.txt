INTRODUCTION A novel technique for secure placement of the anvil for mechanical stapled anastomosis in the proximal colon without exteriorization of the bowel is described. METHODS After standard laparoscopic segmental colonic mobilization, a needle-cannula from a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy kit is passed under direct endoscopic vision transparietally into the colon at the site intended for anvil placement. A wire passed through the cannula into the colon is then withdrawn endoscopically per ano. The stapler anvil is fixed to the wire and pulled back along the intestine before being positioned by traction through the needle puncture site. After distal specimen transection, a standard stapled anastomosis is performed. RESULTS The technique is illustrated in 2 patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoidectomy by either a single port or a multiport procedure with transanal specimen extraction. CONCLUSION By positioning the anvil without colon exteriorization, this technique enables pure intraperitoneal colonic anastomoses that may advance natural orifice operating.

Zoonotic infections constitute a major public health concern. Outbreaks of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza viruses are but recent examples. Although there are many animal-specific adenoviruses and occasionally they have been noted to infect man, rarely have they been studied as potential zoonotic pathogens. In this study, the authors hypothesized that the hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), an avian adenovirus that causes illness among turkeys, might infect humans. Using an enzyme immunosorbent assay, the authors compared sera from 95 turkey-exposed individuals with sera from 82 nonexposed controls for serologic evidence of infection with HEV. Multivariate modeling revealed no statistical difference in elevated antibody titers against HEV between the two groups. These data do not support the hypothesis that avian adenoviruses cross the species barrier to infect humans.

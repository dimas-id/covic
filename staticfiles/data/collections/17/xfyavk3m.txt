Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) of secondary lymphoid organs form distinct niches for interaction with hematopoietic cells. We found here that production of the cytokine IL-15 by FRCs was essential for the maintenance of group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, FRC-specific ablation of the innate immunological sensing adaptor MyD88 unleashed IL-15 production by FRCs during infection with an enteropathogenic virus, which led to hyperactivation of group 1 ILCs and substantially altered the differentiation of helper T cells. Accelerated clearance of virus by group 1 ILCs precipitated severe intestinal inflammatory disease with commensal dysbiosis, loss of intestinal barrier function and diminished resistance to colonization. In sum, FRCs act as an 'on-demand' immunological 'rheostat' by restraining activation of group 1 ILCs and thereby preventing immunopathological damage in the intestine.

BACKGROUND Engineered adenoviruses are being increasingly explored as immunoprophylactic or immunotherapeutic vaccine vectors. Encouraging data from preclinical studies using human adenovirus vectors carrying different antigen genes have resulted in many currently ongoing clinical trials. OBJECTIVE The article seeks to review the current status of the use of adenoviruses as vaccine vectors. METHODS This review is based on the patent literature since 2000 pertaining to the development of adenovirus vaccine vectors for infectious and non-infectious diseases. CONCLUSION Human adenovirus-vectored vaccines have important limitations that stem from their immunogenicity and restrict their utility. This has spurred intensive efforts to find alternative adenovirus vectors and strategies, each with its own advantages and shortcomings.

Aim: The purpose of this study was to predict and analyze the structure and function of 2019-novel Coronavirus (nCoV) key proteins. Materials & methods: We obtained the structure and sequence of proteins from related databases and studied them through multiple sequence alignment, homology modeling, sequence analysis, virtual screening, reverse mutation, protein structure overlap and surface property analysis. Results & conclusion: We found no significant changes in envelope protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid protein and key proteases in open reading frame 1ab, and predicted results of proteins and performed molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the surface properties of spike protein and docking results with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, we believe that the binding ability of spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 may be similar to SARS. These studies will help us in fighting 2019-nCoV.

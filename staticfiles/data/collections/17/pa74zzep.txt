This paper describes the use of Au nanocages covered with smart, thermally-responsive polymers for controlled release with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). HIFU is a highly precise medical procedure that uses focused ultrasound to heat and destroy pathogenic tissue rapidly and locally in a non-invasive or minimally invasive manner. The released dosage could be remotely controlled by manipulating the power of HIFU and/or the duration of exposure. We demonstrated localized release within the focal volume of HIFU by using gelatin phantom samples containing dye-loaded Au nanocages. By placing chicken breast tissues on top of the phantoms, we further demonstrated the feasibility of this system for controlled release at depths up to 30 mm. Because it can penetrate more deeply into soft tissues than near-infrared light, HIFU is a potentially more effective external stimulus for rapid, on-demand drug release.

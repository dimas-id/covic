Pleomorphic virus‐like particles have been observed by electron microscopy in the faeces of children and adults with diarrhoea. Some of these particles were approximately 100 nm in diameter and had a “fringe” of closely applied peplomers approximately 10 nm long; they closely resembled Berne virus of horses and Breda virus of calves, the two representatives of a newly proposed family called the Toroviridae. In one sample a toroidal nucleoprotein‐like structure was observed within the particles. For two samples a buoyant density of 1.14 g/ml was determined by centrifugation through a sucrose density gradient. One sample possessed a haemagglutination for rat erythrocytes. The serological relationship between these different viruses was observed by immune electron microscopy, haemagglutination inhibition, and serum neutralisation. The role of these viruslike particles as candidate pathogens of humans is discussed.

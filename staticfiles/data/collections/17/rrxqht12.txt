The case of a 63-year-old woman who underwent minimal invasive mitral and tricuspid valve repair and a concomitant CryoMaze is described. During creation of the last lesion of the right-sided maze procedure, dissection of the ascending aorta occurred that necessitated emergency sternotomy, replacement of the ascending aorta, and aortocoronary bypass grafting to the right coronary artery (RCA) because of detachment of the RCA from the aortic annulus. Repair of this complication was successful; nevertheless, the patient died 5 days after the operation because of multiorgan failure. The cause of this complication can only be speculated, but a relation to the CyroMaze is obvious. Because of the restricted incision with impaired vision especially in the area of the right atrial appendage, the cryoprobe could have come into contact with the orifice of the RCA during the last lesion, with subsequent detachment of the RCA from the aorta, which could subsequently have caused dissection.

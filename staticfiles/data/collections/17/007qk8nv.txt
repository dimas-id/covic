A novel set of moment invariants for pattern recognition applications, which are based on Jacobi polynomials, are presented. These moment invariants are constructed for digital images by means of a combination with geometric moments, and are invariant in the face of affine geometric transformations such as rotation, translation and scaling, on the image plane. This invariance is tested on a sample of the MPEG-7 CE-Shape-1 dataset. The results presented show that the low-order moment invariants indeed possess low variance between images that are affected by the mentioned geometric transformations.

Pseudoaneurysm of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) has been reported as a rare complication of RVOT reconstruction performed using conduit replacement or patch repair. Rarely, it may present alongside symptoms secondary to the compression of adjoining mediastinal structures. We report the case of a patient who developed a symptomatic RVOT pseudoaneurysm one month after a total correction of tetralogy of Fallot. In the present case, superior vena cava syndrome was caused by compression of the superior vena cava, which was a very unusual presentation.

Abstract Adjuvant enhancing mucosal immune response is preferred in controlling many pathogens at the portal of entry. Earlier, we reported that a toll-like-receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, resiquimod (R-848), stimulated the systemic immunity when adjuvanted with the inactivated Newcastle disease virus vaccine in the chicken. Here, we report the effect of R-848 when adjuvanted with live or inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines with special emphasis on mucosal immunity. Specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks (n = 60) were equally divided into six groups at two weeks of age and immunized with either inactivated or live IBV vaccine adjuvanted with or without R-848. Groups that received either PBS or R-848 served as control. A booster was given on 14 days post-immunization (dpi). R-848 enhanced the antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses when co-administered with the vaccines as evidenced by an increase in the antibody titre in ELISA and stimulation index in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) till 35 dpi and increased proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells on 21 dpi in the flow cytometry. Interestingly, it potentiated the IgA responses in the tear and intestinal secretions when used with both live and inactivated IBV vaccines. The combination of IBV vaccine with R-848 significantly up-regulated the transforming growth factor beta 4 (TGFβ4) transcripts in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than that of the respective vaccine per se. An enhanced secretory IgA response is likely due to the up-regulation of TGFβ4, which is responsible for class switching to IgA. In conclusion, co-administration of R-848 with inactivated or live IBV vaccine enhanced the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the chicken.

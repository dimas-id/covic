Objective To assess food insecurity during pediatric visits to federally qualified health centers (FQHC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design Interviews using the validated American Academy of Pediatrics 2-question food insecurity screen were performed with 200 consecutive families presenting for pediatric care to two FQHC in Central Texas from April 14 to May 20, 2020. Brief qualitative interviews were conducted to determine whether families found a worsening of food insecurity during the pandemic. Results Overall, 47% of families had a positive food insecurity screen. Over 90% of these were worrying about food running out whereas about 60% were positive for the question related to food not lasting. Among food insecurity families, 94% indicated this had begun or worsened during the pandemic. Of the 115 families volunteering information about employment, 46% reported job loss during this time period. Both ethnicity (p < 0.001) and WIC participation (p = 0.03) were associated with greater levels of food insecurity. Among primarily Spanish speaking families participating in the WIC program, 64% reported food insecurity. Conclusions Approximately one-half of families receiving routine pediatric care at a FQHC during the COVID-19 pandemic reported food insecurity and this was associated with loss of jobs during the pandemic. Participation in the WIC program was not protective against food insecurity. Increased frequency of food insecurity was detected in Hispanic and Spanish speaking families. Screening of families at an FQHC should be strongly considered as part of routine pediatric care. Knowledge of community resources is important for providers to share with patients.

Epiphrenic diverticula are known to cause a series of complications. We report the case of a 54-year-old woman who was diagnosed with an epiphrenic diverticulum at a regular checkup in November 2006. Ten years later, she presented with massive hematemesis. Imaging studies revealed an epiphrenic diverticulum measuring 7.8 cm in diameter and a large amount of bleeding inside the diverticulum. Computed tomography showed fistula formation between the diverticulum and the left lower lobe of the lung, leading to the development of a pulmonary abscess. Diverticulectomy and 180Â° posterior partial fundoplication were performed transabdominally. The pulmonary abscess was treated with antibiotics alone. She was discharged 16 days after the operation without any complications over 7 months of follow-up.

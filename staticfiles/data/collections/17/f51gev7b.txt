The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of "in-hospital" inpatient telemedicine within a children's referral hospital to facilitate inpatient care activities such as interprofessional rounding and the provision of supportive services such as lactation consultations to pediatric patients in strict isolation. To test the feasibility of in-hospital video telemedicine, a dedicated telemedicine device was set up in the patient's room. This device and the accompanying Bluetooth stethoscope were used by the health care team located just outside the room for inpatient rounding and consultations from supportive services. Video telemedicine facilitated inpatient care and interactions with support services, reducing the number of health care providers with potential exposure to infection and decreasing personal protective equipment use. In the setting of strict isolation for highly infectious viral illness, telemedicine can be used for inpatient care activities such as interprofessional rounding and provision of supportive services. KEY POINTS: · Telehealth supports patient care in isolation.. · Telehealth reduced health care provider exposures.. · Telehealth conserves personal protective equipment..

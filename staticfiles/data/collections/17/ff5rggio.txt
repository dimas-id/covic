The EU remains under threat of communicable diseases of livestock that may have a severe economic impact or that are of public health significance or both. Such diseases may be introduced and spread by the trading of animals and their products. Measures in line with international agreements are required to prevent the introduction of disease, to control its spread and to protect animal and human health, and to provide safe, wholesome food for European consumers. The EU’s Animal Health Strategy 2013–2017, the Common Financial Framework and the Animal Health Law contributed to the recent update of the EU’s animal health policy. Although the EU’s animal health policy is evaluated to be clearly effective, its cost-effectiveness (efficiency) is difficult to determine.

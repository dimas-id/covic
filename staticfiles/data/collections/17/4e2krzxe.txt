OBJECTIVE: Evaluate renal outcomes and early predictive factors in infants with congenital posterior urethral valves who required catheter or surgical urinary tract decompression within the first 7 days of life. STUDY DESIGN: A 10-year retrospective study at a single hospital. Primary outcomes were estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and development of end stage renal disease (ESRD). RESULTS: Of 35 infants, 50% developed eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 15% progressed to ESRD. Nadir creatinine, need for invasive ventilation in the newborn period, and need for surgical diversion after catheter diversion were associated with worse outcomes. 50% of infants requiring invasive ventilation as neonates developed eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Half of infants with early presentation and intervention developed significant renal insufficiency in childhood, similar to children with later presentation or who had fetal intervention. Invasive ventilation in the newborn period and need for surgical urinary diversion are associated with worse outcomes.

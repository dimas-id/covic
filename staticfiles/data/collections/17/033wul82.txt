Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has signed Executive Orders 20‐28 and 20‐29, which will expand mental health counseling options for Minnesotans and streamline the process for Minnesotans applying for unemployment insurance, Minnesota Bring Me the News reported April 6. Executive Order 20‐28 authorizes out‐of‐state mental health providers to treat Minnesota patients via telehealth services to “help ensure that the mental health needs of Minnesotans are met during the stress and uncertainty of the COVID‐19 pandemic.” The order notes that many Minnesotans receive mental health care from providers in neighboring states, and this order will allow them to continue that care via virtual means. Gov. Walz has been trying to expand Minnesota's mental health care options during COVID‐19, asking President Trump for a major disaster declaration so the state can be reimbursed for expanding community‐based crisis counseling services. Executive Order 20‐29 amends a previous order, EO 20‐05, that was designed to help Minnesotans get unemployment insurance as quickly as possible rather than waiting the previous week following the loss of their jobs. Gov. Walz also announced $6.2 million in financial assistance grants that is earmarked for Minnesota veterans and their families who have been impacted by COVID‐19 and will provide one‐time payments of $1,000.

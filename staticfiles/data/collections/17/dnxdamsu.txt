Infections are one of the most common complications in patients diagnosed with leukemia and serve as a major obstacle to treatment. Through the early 1970s, infections were the most common cause of death in patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, but improvement in treatment and supportive care over the past few decades, coupled with expanded prophylaxis and prevention regimens, have led to reduction in both the frequency and severity of infections. Regardless, due in part to an aging cancer population and the diversity of cancer treatments and procedures, infectious diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with leukemia.

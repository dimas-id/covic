OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG) in patients who had insufficient weight loss or weight regain after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Ortadogu Private Hospital, Turkey, between March 2013 and January 2017. METHODOLOGY Patients who underwent LRSG following LSG due to inadequate weight loss or weight regain retrospectively evaluated. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and bariatric surgery outcomes, as well as hospitalisation rate, excess weight loss percentage (EWL%), and body mass index (BMI ) were recorded. Scheduled follow-up visits after surgery at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-surgery and every six months subsequently were done. RESULTS A total of 21 patients that underwent LRSG after LRG due to inadequate weight loss or a regain in weight. Of them, 7 (33.3%) were males, and 14 (66.7%) were females. The mean body weight index (BMI) before primary LSG was 52.3 ±4.7 Kg/m² and EWL% was 32.7 ±4.6. After an average follow-up of 24 months. BMI of patients before LRSG was 46.1 ±4.3 Kg/m². Following a 1-year observation, there was a substantial (p<0.001) improvement in BMI (21.6 ±3.1 Kg/m 2 ) and excess weight loss percentage (86.82% of EWL). CONCLUSION LRSG is an available and efficient method to correct the regain of weight or inadequate weight loss following LSG.

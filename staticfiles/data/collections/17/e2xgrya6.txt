The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and the radiological and laboratory findings of the hospitalised patients who had novel, laboratory-confirmed, swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) infection with pneumonia. Between October and December 2009, 56 patients hospitalised for pneumonia who were tested for S-OIV infection were retrospectively evaluated. Thirty-three patients had positive S-OIV infections. In addition, 23 of the 56 patients who had negative test results for S-OIV infection were compared with the positive group. The mortality rate amongst the patients with S-OIV infection was 24.2%. Of the 33 patients, 42.4% had at least one underlying medical condition and 4 (12%) patients were pregnant or postpartum. Fourteen patients (42.4%) with S-OIV infection were followed up in an intensive care unit. The most common symptom was dyspnea. The mean peak body temperature during hospital stay (39.42 ± 0.70) was higher in this group than in the negative group (38.51 ± 1.05) (p = 0.001). Thrombocytopenia, increased creatine kinase and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were statistically significant. Bilateral infiltration was more common in the patients with S-OIV infection. Although some laboratory, radiological and clinical data show a significant difference between the patients with S-OIV pneumonia and the negative group, each patient presenting with signs of pneumonia during pandemia should be tested for Influenza A.

PURPOSE Initial reports of transanal ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (taIPAA) suggest safety and feasibility compared with transabdominal IPAA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in technique and results of taIPAA in three centers performing taIPAA across two continents. METHODS Prospective IPAA registries from three institutions in the US and Europe were queried for patients undergoing taIPAA. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data were compiled into a single database and evaluated. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (median age 38 years; range 16-68 years, 43 (69%) male) underwent taIPAA in the three centers (USA 24, UK 23, Italy 15). Most patients had had a subtotal colectomy before taIPAA [n = 55 (89%)]. Median surgical time was 266 min (range 180-576 min) and blood loss 100 ml (range 10-500 ml). Technical variations across the three institutions included proctectomy plane of dissection (intramesorectal or total mesorectal excision plane), specimen extraction site (future ileostomy site vs. anus), ileo-anal anastomosis technique (stapled vs. hand sewn) and use of fluorescence angiography. Despite technical differences, anastomotic leak rates (5/62; 8%) and overall complications (18/62; 29%) were acceptable across the three centers. CONCLUSIONS This is the first collaborative report showing safety and feasibility of taIPAA. Despite technical variations, outcomes are similar across centers. A large multi-institutional, international IPAA collaborative is needed to compare technical factors and outcomes.

The processing, storage, and flux of inorganic carbon in rivers and streams play an influential role in the lateral transfer of atmospheric and terrestrial carbon to the marine environment. Quantifying and understanding this transfer requires a rapid and accurate means of measuring representative concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2 in field settings. This paper describes a field method for the determination of DIC based on the direct measurement of dissolved CO2 using a commercial carbonation meter. A 100-mL water sample is combined with 10 mL of a high ionic strength, low-pH, citrate buffer, mixed well, and the dissolved CO2 concentration is measured directly. The DIC is then calculated based on the dissolved CO2 concentration, buffer-controlled ionic strength, pH, and temperature of the mixture. The method was accurate, precise, and comparable to standard laboratory analytical methods when tested using prepared sodium bicarbonate solutions up to 40 mM DIC, North Atlantic seawater, commercial bottled waters, and carbonate spring waters. Coal mine drainage waters were also tested and often contained higher DIC concentrations in the field than in subsequent laboratory measurements; the greatest discrepancy was for the high-CO2 samples, suggesting that degassing occurred after sample collection. For chemically unstable waters and low-pH waters, such as those from high-CO2 mine waters, the proposed field DIC method may enable the collection of DIC data that are more representative of natural settings.

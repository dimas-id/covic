Abstract Humankind has somewhat of a dark, yet almost fascinating, supernatural relationship with rabies. Even after Pasteur's rabies vaccine discovery, globally people continue to be stricken with it today. History has carried along the myths and legends that surround this diabolical virus. Some still believe that rabies treatment requires 20 or more shots to the stomach by some monstrously long needle. However, today's treatment regimen is typically only four vaccinations (five for immunocompromised) in the arm, plus human rabies immune globulin. This chapter explores the misunderstood concepts of rabies prevalence, signs and symptoms, exposures, and treatment protocols.

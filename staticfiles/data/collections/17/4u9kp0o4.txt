Background Double lumen balloon catheters (DLBCs) are currently used in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, especially when involving balloon or stent-assisted coiling. The existing DLBCs allow the delivery of self-expandable stents but do not offer the possibility to deploy flow-diverters. Despite the increasing use and success of flow-diverters, there have been numerous reports of procedural complications such as early in-stent thrombosis or delayed distal embolization. It seems that these complications can be avoided by correct stent positioning and adequate wall apposition, achieved either by manoeuvres with the microguidewire and/or microcatheter or by performing balloon angioplasty following an exchange guidewire manoeuvre. Objective Report the use of a new DLBC able to deliver a flow-diverter. Methods A 41-year-old woman presented to our hospital with binocular horizontal diplopia for two weeks and reduced visual acuity. A left internal carotid artery aneurysm involving the cavernous and ophthalmic segments was found, with a maximum height of 19 mm and a broad 8 mm neck. It presented extra- and intra-dural components and the parent vessel was significantly narrowed. A decision was made to perform endovascular treatment of the aneurysm with placement of a flow diverter through a DLBC. Results Patency and adequate expansion of the flow diverter with evident intra-aneurysmal contrast stasis was observed in the final angiogram. No peri-procedural complications were observed. Conclusion This is a technical note demonstrating the feasibility of a new device to deploy a flow diverter, aiming to improve wall apposition and stent configuration without the need of additional devices or exchange manoeuvres.

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic with significant mortality. Published studies describing clinical characteristics of the disease contain small cohorts from individual centers or larger series consisting of mixed series from multiple different hospitals. We report here analyses of mortality and disease severity among 402 patients from a single hospital. The cohort includes 297 patients with confirmed and 105 with clinical diagnosis. The latter group consists of cases with inconclusive nucleic acid test but meeting the criteria for clinical diagnosis. Data are compared between genders and among different age groups. The overall case fatality is 5.2%. However, age at 70 years or older is associated with a significantly higher mortality (17.8%) and higher rate of severe and critical illness (57.5%). Case fatality is 8% in patients 50 years of age or older, and 1.2% in those younger than 50 years. In addition, case fatality is 7.6% in male patients, as opposed to 2.9% in females, demonstrating a clear gender difference. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

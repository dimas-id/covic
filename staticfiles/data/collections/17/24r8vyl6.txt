BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Treatment of intracranial fusiform aneurysms is complex and controversial, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The goal of this study was to evaluate the strategy of stent only therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of 20 patients with 20 intracranial fusiform aneurysms undergoing endovascular treatment using stent only therapy was undertaken. Feasibility, safety, and angiographic follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS 28 Leo Plus stents were successfully deployed in 20 patients. No technical difficulties in relation to stent navigation, placement, or detachment from the delivery system were observed. A 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow-up angiograms were performed in all patients. 15 aneurysms showed complete occlusion and five partial stable occlusion. During the follow-up period, there was no evidence of in-stent stenoses or occlusion of the incorporated branching vessels. In this study, no patient presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage or died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Stent only therapy in this study proved very useful as a flow diverter for the treatment of intracranial fusiform aneurysms in which parent artery occlusion or stenting-coiling was not feasible.

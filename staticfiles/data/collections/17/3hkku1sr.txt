Background We aimed to evaluate the impact of a new molecular point-of-care test (POCT), the Cobas Liat Influenza A/B for rapid diagnosis of influenza within 20 min, on the operational workflow of the Trust, accurate diagnosis and potential cost savings during the winter of 2017-2018. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients aged > 18 years tested for flu A/B by laboratory PCR in January 2017 and by POCT in January 2018. Results From 21 December 2017 to 30 April 2018, a total of 1375 POCTs were performed with a total of 479 (35%) influenza-positive cases. Results demonstrated that 1046 (76%) suspected cases did not require isolation or were able to be discharged from Emergency Department (ED), once other risks had been ruled out. We particularly looked into the differences between the month of January 2017 (before POCT) and the month of January 2018. Discussion Results demonstrate that influenza POCT had a positive impact on the Trust regarding prompt patient diagnosis and treatment, discharge decisions, improvement of patient bed management by avoiding unnecessary patient isolation and reducing bay closures, and significant reduction in length of stay in both positive and negative cases. Estimated cost savings were significant.

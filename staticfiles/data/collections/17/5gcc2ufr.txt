Replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is tightly linked to membrane alterations designated the membranous web, harboring the viral replicase complex. In this chapter we describe the morphology and 3D architecture of the HCV-induced replication organelles, mainly consisting of double membrane vesicles, which are generated by a concerted action of the nonstructural proteins NS3 to NS5B. Recent studies have furthermore identified a number of host cell proteins and lipids contributing to the biogenesis of the membranous web, which are discussed in this chapter. Viral RNA synthesis is tightly associated with these membrane alterations and mainly driven by the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. We summarize our current knowledge of the structure and function of NS5B, the role of cis-acting replication elements at the termini of the genome in regulating RNA synthesis and the contribution of additional viral and host factors to viral RNA synthesis, which is still ill defined.

Of late, apart from the four calendar seasons, there is yet another season referred to as the “flu season.” During this time of the year, we routinely hear the phrase “the flu is going around.” I was surprised last week when I heard my 6-year-old son mention to me that there is some bug going around in his class and that his best friend was sick. I asked him to define the bug and he said it causes stuffy nose. The word “bug” is used so callously by adults that it has been registered wrongly in the minds of the little ones.

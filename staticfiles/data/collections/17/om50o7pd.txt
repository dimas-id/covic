Autophagy is a conserved cellular process that acts as a key regulator in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Recent studies implicate an important role for autophagy in infection and immunity by removing invading pathogens and through modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. However, several pathogens, notably some positive-stranded RNA viruses, have subverted autophagy to their own ends. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how viruses with a positive-stranded RNA genome interact with the host autophagy machinery to control their replication and spread. We review the mechanisms underlying the induction of autophagy and discuss the pro- and anti-viral functions of autophagy and the potential mechanisms involved.

One of the great success stories in pneumococcal vaccines is the 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-7); and with wider coverage, the broad prevention it offers would be possible with new vaccines. The 7th International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD-7) was held on the 14-18 March 2010 in Tel Aviv, Israel. During this symposium, clinical and epidemiological features in the post-PCV-7 era, current studies about two new approved PCVs (PHiD-CV and PCV-13) and new data about protein-based vaccines were extensively evaluated. Routine surveillance for pneumococcal infections is essential for all countries whether pneumococcal vaccines are available or not, and long-term results of surveillance help us to understand the PCVs potential benefits. Current epidemiological data about serotype 6C have also been presented from different countries and existing PCVs' efficacy against serotype 6C should be evaluated. In the post-PCV7 era, we have some new emerging serotypes and we also need new vaccines or interventions focused on protection for children against serotypes prevalent in the developing world or broad protection across all pneumococcal serotypes. Effectiveness of the new PCVs against nasopharyngeal carriage, acute otitis media and invasive infections need to be investigated in the real world; immunogenicity of investigational protein-based vaccines, are still evaluated in different settings. We will have a chance to hear and discuss all the new achievements in the many aspects related to pneumococcal diseases at the next ISPPD-8, which will be held in Igua√ßu Falls in 2012.

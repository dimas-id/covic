The human conductive respiratory tract spans a long anatomical distance and represents an important barrier to constrain invading respiratory pathogens. The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33°C and 37°C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics. This knowledge can be exploited for the development of novel intervention strategies against SARS-CoV-2.

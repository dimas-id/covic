CONTEXT The potential for endocrine care via telemedicine has been recognized since the early 2000s when clinical outcome data demonstrated improvements in glycemic control with telemedicine. The widespread use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed telemedicine beyond diabetes care and into clinical areas with a paucity of published data. The evaluation and treatment of thyrotoxicosis heavily relies on laboratory assessment and imaging with physical exam playing a role to help differentiate the etiology and assess the severity of thyrotoxicosis. CASE DESCRIPTION We describe a patient presenting for evaluation of new thyrotoxicosis via telemedicine, and describe modifications to consider for thorough, safe evaluation via telemedicine. CONCLUSION Telemedicine may be an ideal way to assess and treat patients with thyrotoxicosis who are not able to physically attend a visit with an endocrinologist but still have access to a laboratory for blood draws. Potential challenges include access to imaging and high-volume surgeons if needed. Clinical and economic outcomes of telemedicine care of thyrotoxicosis should be studied so that standards of care for endocrine telemedicine can be established.

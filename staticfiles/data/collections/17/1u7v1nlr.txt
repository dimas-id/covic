A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with cardiovascular and multiple organ failure till death. The main mechanisms of virus internalization and interaction with the host are down-regulation or upregulation of the ACE2 receptor, the surface glycoprotein competition mechanism for the binding of porphyrin to iron in heme formation as well as interference with the immune system. The interference on renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, heme formation, and the immune response is responsible for infection diffusion, endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, oxidative damage and releasing of inflammatory mediators. The main pathological findings are bilateral interstitial pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Because ACE receptor is also present in the endothelium of other districts as well as in different cell types, and as porphyrins are transporters in the blood and other biological liquids of iron forming heme, which is important in the assembly of the hemoglobin, myoglobin and the cytochromes, multiorgan damage occurs both primitive and secondary to lung damage. More relevantly, myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and disseminated intravasal coagulation (DIC) are described as complications in patients with poor outcome. Here, we investigated the role of SARSCoV-2 on the cardiovascular system and in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, and possible drug interference on the heart.

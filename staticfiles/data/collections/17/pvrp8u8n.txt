One cannot spend more than 5 minutes on social media at the moment without finding a link to some conspiracy theory or other regarding the origin of SARS-CoV2, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. From the virus being deliberately released as a bioweapon, to pharmaceutical companies blocking the trials of natural remedies to boost their dangerous drugs and vaccines, the internet is rife with far-fetched rumour. And predictably, now that the first immunization trials have started, the anti-vaccine lobby have latched on to most of them. In the last week the trailer for a new 'bombshell documentary' Plandemic has been doing the rounds, gaining notoriety for being repeatedly removed from YouTube and Facebook. We usually wouldn't pay much heed to such things, but for retrovirologists like us the name associated with these claims is unfortunately too familiar: Dr Judy Mikovits.

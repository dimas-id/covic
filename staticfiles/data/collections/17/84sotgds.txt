Host genetic variation has a major impact on infectious disease susceptibility. The study of pathogen resistance genes, largely aided by mouse models, has significantly advanced our understanding of infectious disease pathogenesis. The Collaborative Cross (CC), a newly developed multi-parental mouse genetic reference population, serves as a tractable model system to study how pathogens interact with genetically diverse populations. In this review, we summarize progress utilizing the CC as a platform to develop improved models of pathogen-induced disease and to map polymorphic host response loci associated with variation in susceptibility to pathogens.

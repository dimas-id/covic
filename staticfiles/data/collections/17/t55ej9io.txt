BACKGROUND The Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet is a video-assisted system with a rigid but malleable intubating stylet that facilitates endotracheal intubation. Minimizing cervical spine movement with manual in-line stabilization is essential for patients with cervical spine injuries such as multiple trauma. However, the intubation time of the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet and complications associated with intubation in patients with manual in-line stabilization in the neutral-head and head-lift positions remain unclear. METHODS Patients (20-80 years old) who were scheduled to undergo surgery that required general anesthesia with tracheal intubation were randomly allocated to either a neutral-head (n = 62) or a head-lift position (n = 62) group. Manual in-line stabilization was performed to limit cervical spine mobility. We aimed to evaluate orotracheal intubation time and success rate in these 2 positions with the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet. RESULTS Intubation was faster in the head-lift than in the neutral-head position (20 ± 10 and 25 ± 13 seconds, respectively, P = .000); intubation was equally successful in the 2 positions (96.8% vs 96.8%). Responses to intubation did not differ between positions (heart rate, P = .142; visual analog scale scores for throat soreness, P = .54). The only significant predictor of intubation time was the body mass index in the head-lift position group (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Intubation using the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet with manual in-line stabilization is faster in the head-lift position, and therefore preferable. However, if the head-lift position is not suitable, the neutral-head position is a sensible alternative, with comparable intubation success rate, heart rate change, and postoperative throat soreness.

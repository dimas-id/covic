BACKGROUND Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is a novel approach used for the resection of rectal lesions. The purpose of this study was to review our initial experience with TAMIS. METHODS Between March 2012 and May 2012, we collected clinical data on patients who underwent the TAMIS procedure. This included patient demographics, tumour characteristics, operative technique, histological results and post-operative outcomes. RESULTS Three patients successfully underwent TAMIS resection of rectal lesions. All tumours were tubulovillous adenomas with high-grade dysplasia, with one also having a small focus of adenocarcinoma. Clear margins were achieved in all cases. One case was complicated by a post-operative bleed, requiring a return to theatre. CONCLUSIONS TAMIS is a feasible and cost-effective alternative to transanal endoscopic microsurgery for resection of rectal lesions. It may have a shorter learning curve, especially for laparoscopic surgeons already proficient in single-port procedures.

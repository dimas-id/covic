Several systems are available for the expression of foreign gene sequences inEscherichia coli. We describe the use of prokaryotic expression products of viral gene fragments in order to identify the regions that specify the binding sites of antibodies. This approach is particulary successful if the antigenicity does not depend on the native protein, but only on the amino acid sequence, i.e., if the epitope is sequential. Combining prokaryotic expression with the use of synthetic peptides often permits a fast and accurate mapping of an epitope. The occurrence of immunodominant sequential epitopes on the surface of viruses seems to be a widespread phenomenon.

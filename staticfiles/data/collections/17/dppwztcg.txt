There have been immediate and profound impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 on healthcare services worldwide with major consequences for non-COVID-19 related healthcare. Alongside efforts to reconfigure services and enable continued delivery of safe clinical care for patients with IBD, consideration must also be given to management of IBD research activity. In many centres there has been an effective shutdown of IBD clinical trial activity as research sites have switched focus to either COVID-19 related research or clinical care only. As a result, the early termination of trial programmes and loss of potentially effective therapeutic options for IBD, has become a real and worrying prospect. Moreover, in many countries research activity has become embedded into clinical care â€“ with clinical trials often providing access to new therapies or strategies - which would otherwise not have been available in standard clinical pathways. This pandemic has significant implications for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinical trials in IBD. In this Viewpoint, we share our experiences from a clinical and academic perspective in the United Kingdom, highlighting the early challenges encountered and consider implications for patients and staff at research sites, sponsors, research ethics committees, funders and regulators. We also offer potential solutions both for now and for when we enter a recovery phase from the pandemic.

The impact of COVID-19 on surgical practice is worldwide. Controversy is there regarding dissemination of coronavirus by surgical smoke during laparoscopic surgery; hence, laparoscopic surgeries are being used with great cautions. We propose the use of a simple device, which can be prepared cheaply with material readily available in our hospitals, to manage the surgical plume generated during laparoscopic procedures. With proper management of the surgical plume with the above-proposed device, the concerns regarding aerosol generation can be alleviated and all the benefits of laparoscopy can be extended to our patient in need of a surgery that cannot be delayed.

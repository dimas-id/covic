OBJECTIVE To investigate the serum immunological characteristics in patients convalescent from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS In the 1 st, 3 rd, 6 th month after their discharge, eg. SARS-IgG, T cell subsets, blood routine, and the blood biochemistry were systemically determined in SARS convalescent patients. RESULTS The SARS-antibodies could be used as the diagnostic evidence. During the 6 months after discharge, the titers of SARS-antibodies were high, but they lowered along with passage of time. At the first recheck, the CD4(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 55.9% of patients, the CD3(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 31.2% of patients, and the CD8(+) lymphocyte count was lower than normal level in 14.0% of patients. At the second recheck, the levels of T cell subsets recovered to normal level in the most patients. CONCLUSION T cell subsets, and the number of leukocyte are abnormal in some patients convalescent from SARS. All the indexes examined recover to normal levels half year after discharge. Therefore, it is necessary to follow up the changes in the levels of SARS-antibodies.

Abstract As professors, we have witnessed, anecdotally, a shift in doing social justice advocacy teaching. We have witnessed within some of our classrooms a more empowered hostility and intolerance to conversations pertaining to social justice. We agree that this phenomenon is pedagogical because this language usage not only teaches, but also legitimizes hate speech. We have witnessed the illogical extension of this hate speech with an increase in hate crimes across the country since the 2016 election, Without peaceful protest and grassroots feminist activism, we fear that this speech, this pedagogy, will spread even more violent forms of hate. This research was conducted in and around the first Women's March of 2017. We wanted to know: What were marchers' prior histories of political activism prior to the election? If this was their first time participating in such a manner, how did the election and its early political fallout inspire marchers to attend? 2) What plans did marchers have for political activism after the march? 3) What can be learned from these participants about the current state of political activism in our current era? A total of 788 individuals had taken part in the online survey. Among the participants, 45% marched on Washington, and 55% participated in the march in their local cities. We found that issues of gender equality were of great concern to many of the marchers. In particular, issues related to economic and social equity, including salary. These findings are interesting as they speak to the broader implications of gender equality. And, as the past few years have demonstrated, these issues continue to be of concern.

Abstract The reasons for the relative resistance of children to certain infections such as that caused by coronavirus SARS- CoV2 are not yet fully clear. Deciphering these differences can provide important information about the pathogenesis of the disease. Regarding the SARS-CoV2 virus, children are at the same risk of infection as the general population of all ages, with the most serious cases being found in infants. However, it has been reported that the disease is much less frequent than in adults and that most cases are benign or moderate (even with high viral loads), provided there are no other risk factors or underlying diseases. It is not clear why they have lower morbidity and virtually no mortality. A series of findings, relationships and behavioral patterns between the infectious agent and the child host may account for the lower incidence and a greatly attenuated clinical presentation of the disease in children.

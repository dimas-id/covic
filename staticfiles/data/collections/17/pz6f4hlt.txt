The measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) by ultrasonography (USG) is particularly important for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring when invasive measurements are not possible or are contraindicated. Standard USG (SUDs) devices can be bulky and may break down the workflow. The validity and reliability of pocket-sized USG devices (PSUDs) compared to SUDs for ONSD measurement has not been investigated, yet. We compared the reliability and validity of PSUDs with SUDs for ONSD measurement. 35 patients were included in the study. ONSD measurements with PSUDs and SUDs were performed by two clinicians as three different measurements in both sagittal and transverse axis of the eye. There was agreement between mean transverse ONSD (mtONSD), mean sagittal ONSD (msONSD), and mean ONSD(mONSD) values measured with each device according to Bland–Altman test (p = 0.166, p = 0.135, p = 0.066, respectively) with no proportional bias (p = 0.544, p = 0.868, p = 0.929, respectively). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were found to be greater than 0.7 for mtONSD, msONSD, and mONSD values measured by SUD (ICC = 0.790, ICC = 0.817, and ICC = 0.844, respectively). Similarly, for mtONSD, msONSD, and mONSD values measured by PSUD, ICC were found greater than 0.7 (ICC = 0.763, ICC = 0.814, and ICC = 0.843, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between mtONSD and msONSD (p = 0.441 for SUD and p = 0.893 for PSUD). There was a good correlation between mtONSD and msONSD (r = 0.767 for SUD and r = 0.816 for PSUD). The total variance between three different measurements in the transverse and sagittal axis was ± 0.6 mm. PSUDs can be used with similar validity and reliability as SUDs for ONSD measurement.

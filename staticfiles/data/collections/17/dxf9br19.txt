Various porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) regional elimination projects have been implemented in the U.S., but none have yet succeeded. In part, this reflects the need for efficient methods to monitor over time the progress of PRRSV status of participating herds. This study assessed the feasibility of monitoring PRRSV using oral fluids collected at the abattoir. A total of 36 pig lots were included in the study. On-farm oral fluid (n = 10) and serum (n = 10) collected within two days of shipment to the abattoir were used to establish the reference PRRSV status of the population. Oral fluids (n = 3 per lot) were successfully collected from 32 lots (89%) at the lairage. Three veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs) tested the sera (VDL1 and VDL3: n = 316, VDL2: n = 315) and oral fluids (VDL1 and VDL3: n = 319, VDL2: n = 320) for PRRSV antibodies (ELISA) and RNA (rRT-PCR). Environmental samples (n = 64, 32 before and 32 after pigs were placed in lairage) were tested for PRRSV RNA at one VDL. All oral fluids (farm and abattoir) tested positive for PRRSV antibody at all VDLs. PRRSV positivity frequency on serum ranged from 92.4% to 94.6% among VDLs, with an overall agreement of 97.6%. RNA was detected on 1.3% to 1.9%, 8.1% to 17.7%, and 8.3% to 17.7% of sera, on-farm and abattoir oral fluids, respectively. Between-VDLs rRT-PCR agreement on sera and oral fluids (farm and abattoir) ranged from 97.8% to 99.0%, and 79.0% to 81.2%, respectively. Between-locations agreement of oral fluids varied from 31.3% to 50% depending on the VDL. This study reported the application of swine oral fluids collected at the abattoir for monitoring PRRSV, and describes the between-VDL agreement for PRRS testing of serum and oral fluid field samples.

China is currently in a critical stage of controlling the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). As ophthalmologists working in the center of Wuhan city, the virusâ€™s front line, we recently found conjunctivitis in five COVID-19 patients of a total of 92 COVID-19 patients.One of these five patients had conjunctivitis as the first symptom and was then diagnosed with COVID-19.These observations suggest: the mechanism and pathway of transmission of the novel coronavirus need to be further clarified; the symptoms of conjunctivitis accompanying novel coronavirus infection and conjunctiva as an important entrance point of the virus need to be further verified; early diagnosis, implementation of medical isolation, and giving appropriate treatment to patients with asymptomatic and mild-symptom conjunctivitis are essential to prevent the spread of the epidemic; those with conjunctivitis symptoms should be distinguished from other types of viral conjunctivitis; strict personal protection measures should be taken; and more sensitive techniques should be developed as soon as possible for virus detection in tear and conjunctiva swabs.

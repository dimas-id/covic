In this paper, we combine algorithm of Liu & West for the Particle Filter (PF) with SIRU-type epidemic model to monitor and forecast cases of Covid-19 in Brazil from February up to September. We filter the number of cumulative reported cases and estimate model parameters and more importantly unreported infectious cases (asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals). The parameters under study are related to the attenuation factor of the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious becoming reported as symptomatic infectious. Initially, the problem is analysed through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based simulations to provide initial guesses, which are then refined by means of PF simulations. Subsequently, two additional steps are performed to verify the capability of the adjusted model to predict and forecast new cases. According to the results, the pandemic peak is expected to take place in mid-June 2020 with about 25,000 news cases per day. As medical and hospital resources are limited, this result shows that public health interventions are essential and should not be relaxed prematurely, so that the coronavirus pandemic is controlled and conditions are available for the treatment of the most severe cases.

BACKGROUND A new high-resolution manometry (HRM) parameter, the integrated relaxation pressure (IRP), has been proposed for the assessment of esophageal-gastric junction (EGJ) relaxation. Our aim was to assess the effect of Heller myotomy on IRP in achalasia patients. METHODS We prospectively collected data on achalasia patients who underwent HRM between 2009-2014. Barium swallow was used to assess esophageal diameter and shape. Manometric diagnoses were performed by using the Chicago Classification v3. All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of achalasia were treated surgically with Heller Myotomy RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine consecutive achalasia patients (M:F = 72:67) represented the study population. All the patients had 100% simultaneous waves but 11 had an IRP < 15 mmHg. At median follow-up of 28 months, the median of IRP was significantly lower after surgery (27.4 [IQR 20.4-35] vs 7.1 [IQR 4.4-9.8]; p < 0.001), and so were the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) resting pressure (27 [IQR 18-33] vs 6 [IQR 3-11]; p < 0.001). At univariate analysis, IRP correlated with the gender, LES resting residual pressure, and dysphagia score. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to have examined the role of IRP in achalasia, and how it changes after surgical treatment. An increased preoperative IRP correlated directly with a more severe dysphagia. The IRP was restored to normal by Heller myotomy.

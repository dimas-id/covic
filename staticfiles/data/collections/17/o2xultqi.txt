A systematic investigation of the factors affecting the suture retention test is performed. The specimen width w and the distance a of the suture bite from the specimen free edge emerge as the most influential geometrical parameters. A conservative approach for the quantification of suture retention strength is identified, based on the use of a camera to monitor the incipient failure and detect the instant of earliest crack propagation. The corresponding critical force, called break starting strength, is extremely robust against test parameter variations and its dependence on the specimen geometry becomes negligible when a≥ 2mm and w≥ 10mm. Comparison of suture retention and mode I crack opening tests reveals a linear correlation between break starting strength and tearing energy. This suggests that the defect created by the needle and the load applied by the suture thread lead to a fracture mechanics problem, which dominates the initiation of failure.

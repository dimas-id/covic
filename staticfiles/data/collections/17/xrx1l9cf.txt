This chapter discusses the proteinases involved in plant virus genome expression. The chapter focuses on virus-encoded proteinases. It gives an overall view of the use of proteolytic processing by different plant virus groups for the expression of their genomes. It also discusses that the development of full-length cDNA clones from which infectious transcripts can be produced either in vitro or in vivo, has facilitated the functional analysis of the plant virus proteinases. In spite of the high specificity of the viral proteinases, cellular substrates for animal virus proteinases have been described in this chapter. The activity of the viral proteinases can interfere with important cellular processes to favor virus replication. The recent use of proteinase inhibitors in AIDS therapy has emphasized the convenience of virus-encoded proteinases as targets of antiviral action. A mutant protein able to inhibit the activity of the TEV proteinase by manipulation of the Î±(2)-macroglobulin bait region was designed by Van Rompaey.

The appearance of a benign fistula between the airway and the gastrointestinal tract is a rare complication of esophagectomy. We report a patient with neo-esophago-bronchial fistula that developed 13 months after two-stage esophagectomy. Repeat thoracotomy was not deemed appropriate given the patient's chronic sepsis and malnutrition. After unsuccessful attempts at endoscopic closure, the fistula was successfully and permanently occluded under radiological guidance with an AmplatzerÂ® Vascular Plug 2. The patient remained asymptomatic, with a measured weight gain, 12 months after the successful fistula occlusion.

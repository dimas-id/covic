Bigraphs are a universal graph based model, designed for analysing reactive systems that include spatial and non-spatial (e.g. communication) relationships. Bigraphs evolve over time using a rewriting framework that finds instances of a (sub)-bigraph, and substitutes a new bigraph. In standard bigraphs, the applicability of a rewrite rule is determined completely by a local match and does not allow any non-local reasoning, i.e. contextual conditions. We introduce conditional bigraphs that add conditions to rules and show how these fit into the matching framework for standard bigraphs. An implementation is provided, along with a set of examples. Finally, we discuss the limits of application conditions within the existing matching framework and present ways to extend the range of conditions that may be expressed.

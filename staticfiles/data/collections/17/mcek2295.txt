Clinical and laboratory data available on patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) in Beijing, China remain extremely limited. Here, we summarized the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID‐19 in a designated hospital in Beijing, China. 55 patients with laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection were admitted to Beijing 302 Hospital and enrolled in this study. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected and retrospectively analyzed. 15 (27.3%) of the patients had non‐severe symptom, the mean age was 44.0 years (interquartile range 34.0‐56.0), and median incubation period was 7.5 days (interquartile range 5.0‐11.8). 26 (47.3%) patients had exposure history in Wuhan while 20 (36.4%) were associated with familial clusters. 18 (32.7%) had underlying comorbidities including hypertension. The most common symptoms of illness were fever (45, 81.8%), 51 (92.7%) patients had abnormal findings on chest CT. Laboratory findings showed that neutrophil count, percentage of lymphocyte, percentage of eosinophil, eosinophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, and serum ferritin are potential risk factors for patients with poor prognosis. 26 patients (47.3%) were still hospitalized while 29 (52.7%) had been discharged at this point. Compared with patients in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Beijing are relatively mild. Older age, more comorbidities, and more abnormal prominent laboratory markers were associated with severe condition. On the basis of antiviral drugs, antibiotics treatment, appropriate dosage of corticosteroid and gamma globulin therapy significantly improve patients’ outcomes. Early identification and timely medical treatment are important to reduce the severity of patients with COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

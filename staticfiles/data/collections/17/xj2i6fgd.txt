Telehealth is an area of medicine which has magnified the ability to treat patients remotely. Presently the education of medical professionals pertaining to the value, use, and implementation of telehealth is not adequate to harness the potential of available technologies. Patients engaging in telehealth experience time and cost savings, improved disease management through remote monitoring programs, and high-quality care regardless of geographic location. Despite this, medical education has been slow to evolve. It is therefore imperative that medical curricula incorporate training for this rapidly advancing mode of healthcare delivery to enable students to best care for their future patient population.

Immunity against mucosal pathogens-Editor: Michael Vajdy This book highlights the importance of the close interactions of the mucosal immune system with the systemic immune system and the breadth of pathogens and the diversity of pathogenesis associated with infections at mucosal surfaces. The pathogens detailed in the book epitomize the challenges that confront mucosal immunologists and infectious disease researchers. The reader will gain significant insights into these challenges and approaches that researchers attempting to understand mucosal immunology and host-bacterial interactions take to develop effective therapeutic and prophylactic approaches to infection.

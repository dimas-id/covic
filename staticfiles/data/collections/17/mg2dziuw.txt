The ability to detect the SARS-CoV-2 in a widespread epidemic is crucial for screening of carriers and for the success of quarantine efforts. Methods based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and sequencing are being used for virus detection and characterization. However, RNA viruses are known for their high genetic diversity which poses a challenge for the design of efficient nucleic acid-based assays. The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences already showed novel mutations, which may affect the efficiency of available screening tests leading to false-negative diagnosis or inefficient therapeutics. Here we describe the CoV2ID (http://covid.portugene.com/), a free database built to facilitate the evaluation of molecular methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment of COVID-19. The database evaluates the available oligonucleotide sequences (PCR primers, RT-qPCR probes, etc.) considering the genetic diversity of the virus. Updated sequences alignments are used to constantly verify the theoretical efficiency of available testing methods. Detailed information on available detection protocols are also available to help laboratories implementing SARS-CoV-2 testing.

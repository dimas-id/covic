This letter to the Editor aims to provide suggestions and recommendations for the management of urological conditions in times of COVID-19 crisis in Brazil and other low- and middle-income countries It is important to highlight that one of the main characteristics of this pandemic is the oversaturation of the health system capacity, mostly due to a high demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), Hospital/ICU beds, as well as ventilators In places with limited resources and where the health care systems are already saturated, such consideration is even more worrisome Therefore, most worldwide authorities are recommending to avoid, as much as possible, patient&#039;s elective visits to hospitals, as well as a judicious use of the operating room in order to mitigate the strain put on the health system While efforts should be directed to the care of COVID-19 patients, other conditions (especially urgencies and oncological cases) must continue to be assisted Thus, through a panel of experts, we have prepared a practical guide for urologists based on the recommendations from the main Urologic Associations, as well as data from the literature to support the suggested management We will try to follow the standard guideline recommendations from the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU), with the aim of pursuing the best outcomes possible However, some recommendations were based on the consensus of the panel, taking into consideration the reality of developing countries and the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 crisis Most importantly, all recommendations on this manuscript are based on the expectancy of a maximum 3-month duration of the crisis If this period shall extended, these recommendations will be revised and updated The format of the text will be given through questions and answers (AU)

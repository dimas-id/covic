Results of serological tests carried out over a period of 6 years to detect the presence of antibodies against 14 indigenous viruses in mice and rats used in 32 Canadian institutions are reported. Close to 20,000 individual sera were tested by the complement fixation or the hemagglutination inhibition technics. In order of mouse colony prevalence the six most common viruses present were pneumonia virus of mice, mouse hepatitis virus, rat virus, minute virus of mice, Sendai, and Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis viruses. The most common viruses present in rat colonies were minute virus of mice, K virus, coronaviruses (rat coronavirus or sialodacryoadenitis virus), rat virus, H-1, pneumonia virus of mice, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis viruses, Sendai, and reovirus 3.

A century of advances in infectious disease diagnosis and treatment changed the face of medicine. However, challenges continue to develop including multi-drug resistance, globalization that increases pandemic risks and high mortality from severe infections. These challenges can be mitigated through improved diagnostics, focusing on both pathogen discovery and the host response. Here, we review how 'omics' technologies improve sepsis diagnosis, early pathogen identification and personalize therapy. Such host response diagnostics are possible due to the confluence of advanced laboratory techniques (e.g., transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics) along with advanced mathematical modeling such as machine learning techniques. The road ahead is promising, but obstacles remain before the impact of such advanced diagnostic modalities is felt at the bedside.

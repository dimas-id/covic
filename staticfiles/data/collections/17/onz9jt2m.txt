We conducted focus group interviews to understand how residents of Japan feel about the transport of pathogens. Twelve randomly selected housewives, who had no special knowledge regarding the topic before the interview, expressed their opinions in 2 separate meetings regarding pathogen transport. The results of the interviews were analyzed by the KJ method. The analysis found that although the transport of pathogens is universally recognized to be necessary, there is not clear consensus on the exact methods of transport, the positive and/or negative value of such information, and how clearly and/or uniquely to label containers, packages, compartments, vehicles, and conditions used for such transportation. Further studies to improve the skills of both the providers and receivers of such information (a technique of risk communication) are necessary.

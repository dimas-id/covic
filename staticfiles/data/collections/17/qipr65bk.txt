In this half-day tutorial, we will review the basic concepts of, methods for, and applications of geographic information retrieval, also showing some possible applications in fields such as the digital humanities. The tutorial is organized in four parts. First we introduce some basic ideas about geography, and demonstrate why text is a powerful way of exploring relevant questions. We then introduce a basic end-to-end pipeline discussing geographic information in documents, spatial and multi-dimensional indexing [19], and spatial retrieval and spatial filtering. After showing a range of possible applications, we conclude with suggestions for future work in the area.

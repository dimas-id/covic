The rapid spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has sparked a search for effective therapies. The discovery that the virus binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has led to investigation of the reninâ€“angiotensin system for possible therapeutic targets. We present a case of an elderly woman with multiple comorbidities who developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a cardiomyopathy, and vasodilatory shock secondary to COVID-19 and was treated with exogenous angiotensin II. She rapidly demonstrated significant hemodynamic improvement without noted adverse effects. Thus, we propose further investigation into possible benefits of angiotensin II in shock secondary to COVID-19.

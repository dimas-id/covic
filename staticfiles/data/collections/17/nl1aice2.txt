The stress response influences the immune system, and studies in laboratory animals indicate that the response to stress significantly reduces resistance to infectious challenge. Only a few studies, however, have determined the impact of the stress response on human susceptibility to infectious challenge due, in part, to the difficulties of using live, replicating pathogens in human research. As a result, many studies have assessed the immune response to vaccination as a surrogate for the immune response to an infectious challenge. Thus, much is known about how the stress response influences adaptive immunity, and memory responses, to vaccination. These studies have yielded data concerning the interactions of the nervous and immune systems and have provided important information for clinicians administering vaccines to susceptible populations. This review provides a brief overview of the immune response to commonly used vaccines and the impact that stress can have on vaccine-specific immunity.

Background: Jet-lag may affect air-travelers crossing at least two time-zones and has several health-care implications. It occurs when the human biological rhythms are out of synch with respect to the day-night cycle at the country destination. Its effect in psoriasis is missing. We aimed to evaluate the effect of Jet-lag in psoriatic patients' management. Methods: This is a prospective observational study that enrolled psoriatic patients that underwent a flight: patients who experienced jet-lag were compared to patients who did not experience jet-lag. Before the flight, a dermatologist recorded clinical and demographical data with particular attention to Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) and Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA). Patients performed Self-Administered Psoriasis Area Severity Index (SAPASI), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and the pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores. After the flight, patients completed the SAPASI, DLQI and pruritus-VAS scores. Results: The sample recruited comprised of 70 psoriatic patients aged 42.4 ± 9.7 years (median 42.5 years). Thirty (42.9%) were males, mean BMI was 25.5 ± 2.2 kg/m2. Average disease duration was 15.2 ± 7.1 years, and 20 (28.6%) subjects had developed PsA. Average hours of flight were 5.4 ± 3.5 (median 3.5 h), with 34 (48.6%) subjects reporting jet-lag. At the multivariate regression analysis, the change in the SAPASI score resulted correlated with jet-lag (regression coefficient 1.63, p = .0092), as well the change in the DLQI score (regression coefficient = 1.73, p = .0009), but no change on the pruritus VAS scale was found. Conclusions: The present study suggests that jet-lag may influence disease severity and DLQI scores, but not itch in psoriatic patients.

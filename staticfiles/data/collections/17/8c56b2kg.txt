Findings from a survey of 1,000 patients, ages 18 to 65 or older, about their virtual care experiences during the COVID‐19 pandemic published in the Patient Perspectives on Virtual Care report found that nearly three‐quarters of respondents engaged in their first virtual care visit ever during the initial surge of COVID‐19 cases in the United States. Over 75% were very or completely satisfied with their virtual care experiences. However, the results also suggest that health care organizations have an opportunity to enhance patient experience, acquisition and retention by making virtual care scheduling and follow‐up more seamless, The Associated Press reported June 24. The survey examined patients' experiences accessing virtual care, their sentiment around the visits themselves and their demand for virtual care in the future. Not only did the majority of respondents rate their experiences with virtual care positively, but 50% also indicated they would be willing to switch providers to have virtual visits on a regular basis. Kyruus, an organization that helps health systems match patients with the right providers, engaged Wakefield Research to conduct the survey between February and May of 2020.

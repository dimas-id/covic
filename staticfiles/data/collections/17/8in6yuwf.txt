BACKGROUND: Tremendous progress has been made in the past 20 years in understanding the roles played by immunophilins, and in particular the cyclophilins, in supporting the replication cycles of human viruses. A growing body of genetic and biochemical evidence and data from clinical trials confirms that cyclophilins are essential cofactors that contribute to establishing a permissive environment within the host cell that supports the replication of HIV-1 and HCV. Cyclophilin A regulates HIV-1 replication kinetics and infectivity, modulates sensitivity to host restriction factors, and cooperates in the transit of the pre-integration complex into the nucleus of infected cells. Cyclophilin A is an essential cofactor whose expression supports HCV-specific RNA replication in human hepatocytes. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitors have been used in clinical trials to validate cyclophilins as antiviral targets for the treatment of HIV-1 and Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection and as molecular probes to identify the roles played by immunophilins in supporting the replication cycles of human viruses. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes emerging research that defines the functions of immunophilins in supporting the replication cycles of HIV-1, HCV, HBV, coronaviruses, and other viral pathogens and describes new information that suggests a role for immunophilins in regulating innate immune responses against chronic viral infection. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The dependence on cyclophilins by evolutionarily distinct viruses for accomplishing various steps in replication such as viral entry, initiation of genomic nucleic acid replication, viral genome uncoating, nuclear import and nuclear entry, emphasizes the potential of cyclophilin inhibitors as therapeutic agents.

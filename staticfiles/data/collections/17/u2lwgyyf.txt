The genomic RNA of hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes the viral polyprotein precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage into structural and nonstructural proteins by cellular and the viral NS3 and NS2-3 proteases. Nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is a cofactor of the NS3 serine protease and has been demonstrated to inhibit protein synthesis. In this study, GST pull-down assay was performed to examine potential cellular factors that interact with the NS4A protein and are involved in the pathogenesis of HCV. A trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that one of the GST-NS4A-interacting proteins to be eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Both the N-terminal domain of NS4A from amino acid residues 1–20, and the central domain from residues 21–34 interacted with eEF1A, but the central domain was the key player involved in the NS4A-mediated translation inhibition. NS4A(21–34) diminished both cap-dependent and HCV IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner. The translation inhibitory effect of NS4A(21–34) was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in an in vitro translation system. Taken together, NS4A inhibits host and viral translation through interacting with eEF1A, implying a possible mechanism by which NS4A is involved in the pathogenesis and chronic infection of HCV.

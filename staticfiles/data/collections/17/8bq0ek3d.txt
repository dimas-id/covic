A new HPV-16/18 bivalent vaccine expressed by the Escherichia coli has been proven to be efficacious in adult women. A randomized, immunogenicity noninferiority study of this candidate vaccine was conducted in December 2015 in China. Girls aged 9–14 years were randomized to receive 2 doses at months 0 and 6 (n=301) or 3 doses at months 0, 1 and 6 (n=304). Girls aged 15–17 years (n=149) and women aged 18–26 years (n=225) received 3 doses. The objectives included noninferiority analysis of the IgG geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio (95% CI, lower bound>0.5) to HPV-16 and HPV-18 at month 7 in girls compared with women. In the per-protocol set, the GMC ratio of IgG was noninferior for girls aged 9–17 years receiving 3 doses compared with women (1.76 (95% CI, 1.56, 1.99) for HPV-16 and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.69, 2.21) for HPV-18) and noninferior for girls aged 9–14 years receiving 2 doses compared with women (1.45 (95% CI, 1.25, 1.62) for HPV-16 and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.02, 1.33) for HPV-18). Noninferiority was also demonstrated for neutralizing antibodies. The immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine in girls receiving 3 or 2 doses was noninferior compared with that in young adult women.

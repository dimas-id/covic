Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since first being described in January 2020. Clinical manifestations in non-transplant patients range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan system failure, and death. Limited reports in kidney transplant recipients suggest similar characteristics in that population. We report here the first case series of COVID-19 infection occurring in pancreas transplant recipients.

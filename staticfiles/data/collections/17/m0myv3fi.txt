BACKGROUND AND AIMS Bispectral index (BIS) values may be anaesthetic agent-specific, depending on their ability to suppress the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We carried out a prospective, randomised clinical trial to study the effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) on the BIS values at an equi-minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane and desflurane. METHODS Sixty adult patients undergoing spine surgery were randomised into two groups; Group S (sevoflurane; n = 30) and Group D (desflurane; n = 30) for the maintenance of anaesthesia in oxygen and air or oxygen and N2O mixture (FiO2-0.4) (Stage 1). BIS and fraction of inspired and end-tidal concentration of agents were noted at 1.0 MAC. In Stage 2, air or N2O was discontinued and the other carrier gas was introduced. At steady state of this carrier gas, values were again noted as in Stage 1. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni correction, and Student's t-test for paired data. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS With air-oxygen as the carrier gas, sevoflurane and desflurane resulted in comparable BIS values (P = 0.44). With addition of 60% N2O, there was a significant increase in BIS values at 1.0 MAC for both the agents. Furthermore, higher BIS values were observed with sevoflurane compared to desflurane (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION Sevoflurane and desflurane at equi-MAC concentration exert similar effect on BIS values when used with air-oxygen. N2O results in higher BIS values; this effect is more pronounced in combination with sevoflurane.

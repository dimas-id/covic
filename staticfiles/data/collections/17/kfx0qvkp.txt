Summary Three intricate and intertwined biological features in the replication cycle of viruses are covered in this chapter: The range of cellular entities that support virus replication and/or virus transmission, and the various relationships viruses establish with their hosts and biological vectors. Although in its infancy, an explosion of research on virusâ€“host interactions has already revealed surprising relationships ranging from strictly parasitic to mutualistic, and some others in between. A clearer picture is emerging as regards to our understanding of the full spectrum of these interactions, even with varying experimental approaches and differing opinions on terminology and data interpretation.

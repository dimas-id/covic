The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound impact on Radiology practices across the country. Policy measures adopted to slow the transmission of disease are decreasing the demand for imaging independent of COVID-19. Hospital preparations to expand crisis capacity are further diminishing the amount of appropriate medical imaging that can be safely performed. While economic recessions generally tend to result in decreased health care expenditures, radiology groups have never experienced an economic shock that is simultaneously exacerbated by the need to restrict the availability of imaging. Outpatient heavy practices will feel the biggest impact of these changes, but all imaging volumes will decrease. Anecdotal experience suggests that radiology practices should anticipate 50%-70% decreases in imaging volume that will last a minimum of 3-4 months, depending on the location of practice and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region. The CARES Act provides multiple means of direct and indirect aid to healthcare providers and small businesses. The final allocation of this funding is not yet clear, and it is likely that additional congressional action will be necessary to stabilize health care markets. Administrators and practice leaders need to be proactive with practice modifications and financial maneuvers that can position them to emerge from this pandemic in the most viable economic position. It is possible that this crisis will have lasting effects on the structure of the radiology field.

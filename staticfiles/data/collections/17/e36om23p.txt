Sequence-specific NMR assignments of an internal domain of the protein nsp3, nsp3(513â€“651), which is a part of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replicase polyprotein, have been determined, using triple-resonance NMR experiments with the uniformly [(13)C,(15)N]-labeled protein. The complete assignments (>99%) provide the basis for the ongoing three-dimensional structure determination.

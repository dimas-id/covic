Abstract The 3C protease from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV 3Cpro) is critical for viral pathogenesis, having vital roles in both the processing of the polyprotein precursor and RNA replication. Although recent structural and functional studies have revealed new insights into the mechanism and function of the enzyme, key questions remain that must be addressed before the potential of FMDV 3Cpro as an antiviral drug target can be realised.

The international trade in poultry hatching eggs could potentially facilitate the global dissemination of poultry disease. Provided the guidelines of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on breeding flock hygiene are followed, of those avian diseases currently listed by the OlE, only highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), Newcastle disease (ND), and avian mycoplasmosis (caused by Mycoplasma gallisepticum or M. synoviae) should be considered likely to be spread though trade in this commodity. Furthermore, the impact of HPAI and ND on egg production and hatchability will constrain the potential for these agents to be spread by poultry hatching eggs.

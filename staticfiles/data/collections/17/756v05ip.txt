Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is currently a pandemic with a mortality rate of 1%‐6% in the general population. However, the mortality rate seems to be significantly higher in elderly patients, especially those hospitalized with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery diseases. Because viral diseases may have atypical presentations in immunosuppressed patients, the course of the disease in the transplant patient population is unknown. Hence, the management of these patients with COVID‐19 is an area of interest, and a unique approach is warranted. Here, we report the clinical features and our treatment approach for a kidney transplant patient with a diagnosis of COVID‐19. We believe that screening protocols for SARS‐Cov‐2 should be re‐evaluated in patients with solid‐organ transplants.

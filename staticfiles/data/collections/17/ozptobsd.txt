Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm sometimes found in the orbit. We report a case of an aggressive orbital SFT with enlarged feeding vessels that was successfully resected immediately after transarterial embolization with Onyx (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer). To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the histopathology of Onyx embolization material in an orbital SFT.

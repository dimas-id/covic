Abstract Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit the infection of a wide range of viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). At present, little is known about how viruses overcome IFITM restriction. In this study, we have utilized HIV-1 as a model and selected IFITM1-resistant viruses after multiple passages of HIV-1 in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. Sequencing the entire viral genome revealed several mutations in the vpu and envelope genes, among which mutations Vpu34 and EnvG367E together enable efficient HIV-1 replication in IFITM1-expressing cells. Vpu34 introduces a stop codon at amino acid position 35 of Vpu, whereas EnvG367E changes the G367 residue at the CD4-binding site of gp120. These two mutations do not appear to overcome the downregulation of viral p24 expression caused by IFITM1, but rather enhance HIV-1 replication by promoting cell-to-cell virus transmission. Altogether, our data demonstrate that HIV-1 can mutate to evade IFITM1 restriction by increasing cell-to-cell transmission.

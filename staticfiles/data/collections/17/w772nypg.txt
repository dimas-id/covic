Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is the etiological agent that causes porcine circovirus diseases and porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVD/PCVAD), which are present in every major swine-producing country in the world. PCV2 infections may downregulate the host immune system and enhance the infection and replication of other pathogens. However, the exact mechanisms of PCVD/PCVAD are currently unknown. To date, many studies have reported that several cofactors, such as other swine viruses or bacteria, vaccination failure, and stress or crowding, in combination with PCV2, lead to PCVD/PCVAD. Among these cofactors, co-infection of PCV2 with other viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, swine influenza virus and classical swine fever virus have been widely studied for decades. In this review, we focus on the current state of knowledge regarding swine co-infection with different PCV2 genotypes or strains, as well as with PCV2 and other swine viruses.

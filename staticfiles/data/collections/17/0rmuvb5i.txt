Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a recently described membrane-bound carboxypeptidase identified by its homology to ACE, the enzyme responsible for the formation of the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (Ang II). ACE2 inactivates Ang II and is thus thought to act in a counter-regulatory fashion to ACE. ACE2 is highly expressed in epithelial cells of distal renal tubules, and recent evidence indicates that expression is increased in a range of renal diseases. A soluble form of ACE, generated by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form, has been shown to be present in urine; although evidence for a similar release of ACE2 has been reported in cell culture, it is not yet known whether this occurs in vivo. The present study has identified ACE2 in human urine, both by a sensitive fluorescence-based activity assay and by Western immunoblot. Levels of ACE2 were surprisingly higher than ACE, which may reflect preferential targeting of the enzyme to the luminal surface of the renal epithelium. Future studies will determine whether increased expression of ACE2 in renal diseases are reflected in higher urinary levels of this novel enzyme.

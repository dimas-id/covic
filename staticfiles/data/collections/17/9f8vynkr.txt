BACKGROUND Salvage surgery after transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) has shown mixed results. Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) might be advantageous in this population. The aim of this study was to assess the short-term oncologic and operative outcomes of salvage surgery after TEM, comparing TaTME to conventional salavge TME (sTME). METHODS Consecutive patients treated with salvage surgery after TEM were identified. Patients who underwent TaTME were compared to those who had conventional sTME. The primary outcome was the ability to perform an appropriate oncologic procedure defined by a composite outcome (negative distal margins, negative radial margins and complete or near complete mesorectum specimen). RESULTS During the study period, 41 patients had salvage surgery after TEM. Of those, 11 patients had TaTME while 30 patients had sTME. All patients in the TaTME group met the composite outcome of appropriate oncologic procedure compared to 76.7% for the conventional sTME group (p = 0.19). TaTME was associated with significantly higher rates of sphincter preservation (100 vs. 50%, p = 0.01), higher rates of laparoscopic surgery (100 vs. 23.3%, p < 0.001) and lower rates of conversion to open surgery (9.1 vs. 57%, p < 0.001). No difference was found in postoperative morbidity (36.3 vs. 36.7%, p = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that for patients requiring salvage surgery after TEM, TaTME is associated with significantly higher rates of sphincter-sparing surgery when compared to conventional transabdominal TME while producing adequate short-term oncologic outcomes. Salvage surgery after TEM might be a clear indication for TaTME rather than conventional surgery.

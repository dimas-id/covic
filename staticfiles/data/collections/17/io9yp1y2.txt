Within the hematologic therapy procedures, stem cell transplantation (SCT) represents the most extensive and invasive intervention. Those patients have certain risks for several bacterial, viral, as well as fungal infections during the different stages of transplantation. Especially in allogenic transplantation, discrimination of non-infectious, mostly immunologic complications like graft-versus-host reactions or VOD (veno-occlusive disease) is crucial, and often represents a therapeutic challenge. An adequate intensive care therapy of these patients can only be achieved with the knowledge of the specific complications of SCT. This review starts with an overview of the SCT stages with their corresponding infectious and noninfectious complications, followed by the discussion of organ specific pulmonary, renal, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic and neurological complications of stem cell transplantation.

Abstract A novel microarray was constructed with DNA PCR product probes targeting species specific functional genes of nine clinically significant respiratory pathogens, including the Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes), the Gram-negative organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii Haemophilus spp., Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as the atypical bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In a “proof-of-concept” evaluation of the developed microarray, the microarray was compared with real-time PCR from 14 sputum specimens from COPD patients. All of the samples positive for bacterial species in real-time PCR were also positive for the same bacterial species using the microarray. This study shows that a microarray using PCR probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations, including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.

Considering that parents are one of the key figures in their child’s participation in physical activity, it is extremely important to examine parents’ perceptions and experiences of physical activity in order to protect children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from the inactive life during the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and to include them in physical activities in the home environment. Although it is still a new subject, there is no research that addresses parents’ physical activity knowledge, needs and recommendations for the physical activity experiences of children with ASD during the COVID-19 outbreak, and offers solutions accordingly. Considering this gap in the literature, the aim of this qualitative study is to explore parents’ perceptions on physical activity for their children with ASD. Participants of the study were 10 parents with children with ASD, who participated in one-to-one semi-structured phone calls. Interview data were analyzed thematically. The analysis of the data revealed three main themes: 1) Possible benefits of physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) Physical activity barriers during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 3) Recommendations for physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results revealed that parents thought that physical activities had a positive effect on the development areas of their children with ASD. It was determined that parents want to involve their children in physical activities in the home environment, but they have barriers that they need to overcome.

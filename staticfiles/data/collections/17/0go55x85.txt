Respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) is a non-invasive method of measuring change in lung volume which is well-established as a monitor of tidal ventilation and thus respiratory patterns in sleep medicine. As RIP is leak independent, can measure end-expiratory lung volume as well as tidal volume and is applicable to both the ventilated and spontaneously breathing patient, there has been a recent interest in its use as a bedside tool in the intensive care unit.

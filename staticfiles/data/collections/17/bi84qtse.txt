Abstract Detection of infectious viral agents has been on the increase globally with the advent and usage of more sensitive and selective novel molecular techniques in the epidemiological study of viral diseases of economic importance to the swine industry. The observation is not different for the pig-infecting member of the subfamily Parvovirinae in the family Parvoviridae as the application of novel molecular methods like metagenomics has brought about the detection of many other novel members of the group. Surprisingly, the list keeps increasing day by day with some of them possessing zoonotic potentials. In the last one decade, not less than ten novel swine-infecting viruses have been added to the subfamily, and ceaseless efforts have been in top gear to determine the occurrence and prevalence of the old and new swine parvoviruses in herds of pig-producing countries worldwide. The story, however, is on the contrary on the African continent as there is presently a dearth of information on surveillance initiatives of the viruses among swine herds of pig-producing countries in the region. Timely detection and characterization of the viral pathogens is highly imperative for the implementation of effective control and prevention of its spread. This review therefore presents a concise overview on the epidemiology of novel porcine parvoviruses globally and also provides up-to-date highlights on the reported cases of the viral agents in the African sub-region.

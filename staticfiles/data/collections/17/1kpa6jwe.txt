OBJECTIVES: The aim of this trial is to identify the effect of ambulatory treatment in early COVID-19 disease with hydroxychloroquine on the rate of hospitalization or death in older patients above the age of 64. TRIAL DESIGN: Parallel, 2:1 randomization, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female patients above the age of 64 (i.e. ≥65 years of age) with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by SARS-CoV2 positive throat swab (PCR). Patients can only be included within 3 days of symptom onset in ambulatory care if they consent to the study procedure and are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and protocol requirements (including telephone visits concerning symptoms and side effects). Severity of disease at inclusion is mild to moderate defined as not requiring hospital admission: SpO2 >94%, respiratory rate <20, mental state alert, no signs of septic shock. Cardiac risk is minimised by requiring a Tisdale score ≤ 6. Patients are recruited in the two german cities of Ulm and Tübingen in various ambulatory care settings. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Each patient will be given a first dose of 600 mg Hydroxychloroquine or the equivalent number of placebo capsules (3 capsules) at the day of inclusion. From the 2(nd) day on, each patient will get 200 mg or the equivalent number of placebo capsules twice a day (400mg/day) until day 7 (6 more does of 400 mg); a cumulative dose of 3 g. MAIN OUTCOMES: Rate of hospitalization or death at day 7 after study inclusion RANDOMISATION: All consenting adult patients having confirmed COVID-19 are randomly and blindly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to either IMP or placebo. The biostatistical center produced a randomization list (block randomization) with varying block length and stratified for the study center. This list is provided for packaging to the pharmaceutical unit which is providing encapsulated placebo and IMP. Only the pharmaceutical unit is aware of group allocation according to the randomization list. BLINDING (MASKING): Patients and investigators, as well as treating physicians are blinded to the treatment- allocation. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): In the first stage of an adaptive design 120 patients in a 2:1 ration: 72 Verum and 36 Placebo, plus an increase for 10% drop outs. After interim analysis, the total sample size will be calculated based on the effect seen in the first stage. Total sample size is estimated approximately n = 300-400 patients.

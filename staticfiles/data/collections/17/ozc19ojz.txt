BACKGROUND The treatment of patients with multiple synchronous tumors is challenging and complex. The use of next generation sequencing (NGS) may help in identification of germline mutations in genes involved in a common etiology for both tumors thus allowing a common effective therapeutic strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We describe the unexpected positive results obtained in a young woman with relapsed chemo-resistant stage IVB cervical and synchronous stage IV lung cancer, who underwent an interdisciplinary approach including palliative surgery with laparoscopic total pelvic exenteratio followed by a chemo-immunotherapy protocol with the anti-Programmed Death (PD)-1 antibody nivolumab plus metronomic cyclophosphamide. The treatment choice was based on tumor PD-Ligand 1 assessment and NGS analysis for the identification of potential treatment targets. Outcomes included tumor objective response and patient-centered outcomes (pain, performance status and overall quality of life). RESULTS Laparoscopic surgery obtained an immediate symptom control and allowed the early start of medical treatment. One month after combined therapy start the patient achieved a significant improvement in performance status, pain, overall Quality of life and after 3 months she resumed working. After 3 and 6 months of treatment we observed an objective dimensional and metabolic response. Currently, after 24 months (and 48 cycles of nivolumab) the patient is continuing to benefit from treatment: she is in complete remission, with good performance status and she is working and leading a self-dependent life. CONCLUSION Our study strongly affirms the efficacy of an interdisciplinary approach including surgical and innovative medical strategies based on immunotherapy in patients with advanced chemo-resistant synchronous cervical and lung cancer. The present findings support the use of NGS to drive a targeted rational treatment especially in heavily pre-treated patients.

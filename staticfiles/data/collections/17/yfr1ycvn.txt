OBJECTIVES We aimed to show how increased experience of a surgery team in fMMC repair influences maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We compare perinatal results of fMMC repair in our Fetal Surgery Center (FSC) in cohort groups for the early period (2005-2011 year; previous - PFSC, n = 46) and current period (2012-2015 year; current - CFSC, n = 74) to results of the randomized Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS, 78 patients). RESULTS The maternal morbidity due to fMMC repair was low and there was no difference comparing CFSC to PFSC and MOMS. The frequency of iatrogenic preterm labor (iPTL) â‰¤ 30 weeks of gestation decreased from 34.1% in PFSC to 23.9% in CFSC. Iatrogenic preterm premature rupture of membranes (iPPROM) was a common complication after fMMC repair in all cohorts. The total reduction rate of hindbrain hernation (HH) was similar in CFSC - 90.3% and PFSC - 82.1%. CONCLUSIONS The increasing experience of our surgery team in fMMC repair majorly decreased the risk of iPTL.

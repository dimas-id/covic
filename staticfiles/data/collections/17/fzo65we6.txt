The preparation of an integrated biosensor for the easy, fast, and sensitive determination of miRNAs is described based on a direct hybridization format and a label-free voltammetric detection. The biosensor involves a disposable carbon electrode substrate doubly nanostructured with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and AuNPs modified with pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) and 6-ferrocenylhexanethiol (Fc-SH), respectively. A synthetic amino terminated DNA capture probe was covalently immobilized on the CO2H moieties of PCA/rGO, while Fc-SH was used as a signaling molecule. Differential pulse voltammetry was employed to record the decrease in the oxidation peak current of Fc after the hybridization due to the hindering of the electron transfer upon the formation of the DNA-RNA duplex on the electrode surface. The stepwise biosensor preparation was characterized by surface and electrochemical techniques showing the role played by each biosensor component as well as the reliability of the target miRNA determination. The determination of the oncogene miRNA-21 synthetic target allowed quantification in the low femtomolar range (LOD of 5 fM) with a high discrimination of single-base mismatched sequences in a single 30-min incubation step. The bioplatform allowed the determination of the target miRNA in a small amount of total RNA extracted from breast cancer (BC) cells or directly in serum samples collected from BC patients without the need for prior extraction, purification, amplification, or reverse transcription of the genetic material and with no matrix effect.

Abstract Background: The study tries to understand the incidence of COVID-19 among police officials along with the challenges they face and their preparedness during the pandemic response in Maharashtra. Method: The study analyzed the daily trends of confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased cases for Maharashtra and police professional. Ten telephonic in-depth interviews and a descriptive survey were conducted to obtain experiences of police regarding their combat against Covid-19. Results: PPR (0.01 to 1.12), CRR (0 to 39.22) and CFR (0 to 1.07) have consistently increased and CRR found lower among police than the general population. The qualitative data by analyzing several indicators suggests that there is a higher individual efficacy over collective efficacy among the police force. Further, the long-time fight against Covid-19 had drained police force mentally and physically and this put them in higher risk.

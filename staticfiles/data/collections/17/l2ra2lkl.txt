BACKGROUND When used separately, antineoplastic agents and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) pneumoperitoneum have been reported to impair anastomotic healing in experimental animals. However, the effects of their combined use have not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil followed by CO(2) pneumoperitoneum would affect the healing of anastomoses in the colon. METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 48) were given 5-fluorouracil (20 mg/kg/day) for 5 days, and were then assigned to one of the three groups. Prior to surgery, the control group received no pneumoperitoneum. The other two groups received pneumoperitoneum at 6 and 12 mmHg, respectively, for 2 hr. The large intestine was transected and anastomosis was performed via median laparotomy. On postoperative days 3 and 7, relaparotomy was performed in half of the rats in each group. From the colon, a segment including the anastomosis was excised. Tissue hydroxyproline levels were measured. For histological evaluation, the Verhofstad scale was modified and used. RESULTS No significant differences in hydroxyproline levels were seen across the groups on postoperative days 3 or 7. However, by postoperative day 7, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and necrosis in the 6-mmHg group had decreased markedly, and granulation had improved. CONCLUSION Overall, these findings suggest that preoperative 5-fluorouracil therapy followed by pneumoperitoneum at 6 or 12 mmHg does not impair anastomotic healing.

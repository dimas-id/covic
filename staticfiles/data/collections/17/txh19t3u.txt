BACKGROUND: Recombinant Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis (S. Choleraesuis) vaccine vector could be used to deliver heterologous antigens to prevent and control pig diseases. We have previously shown that a live-attenuated S. Choleraesuis vaccine candidate strain rSC0011 (ΔP(crp527)::TT araC P(BAD)crp Δpmi-2426 ΔrelA199::araC P(BAD)lacI TT ΔasdA33, Δ, deletion, TT, terminator) delivering SaoA, a conserved surface protein in most of S. suis serotypes, provided excellent protection against S. suis challenge, but occasionally lead to morbidity (enteritidis) in vaccinated mice (approximately 1 in every 10 mice). Thus, alternated attenuation method was sought to reduce the reactogenicity of strain rSC0011. Herein, we described another recombinant attenuated S. Choleraesuis vector, rSC0012 (ΔP(fur88):: TT araC P(BAD)fur Δpmi-2426 ΔrelA199:: araC P(BAD)lacI TT ΔasdA33) with regulated delayed fur mutation to avoid inducing disease symptoms while exhibiting a high degree of immunogenicity. RESULTS: The strain rSC0012 strain with the ΔP(fur88)::TT araC P(BAD)fur mutation induced less production of inflammatory cytokines than strain rSC0011 with the ΔP(crp527)::TT araC P(BAD)crp mutation in mice. When delivering the same pS-SaoA plasmid, the intraperitoneal LD(50) of rSC0012 was 18.2 times higher than that of rSC0011 in 3-week-old BALB/C mice. rSC0012 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 was cleared from spleen and liver tissues 7 days earlier than rSC0011 with same vectors after oral inoculation. The strain rSC0012 synthesizing SaoA induced high titers of anti-SaoA antibodies in both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in vaginal washes) sites, as well as increased level of IL-4, the facilitator of Th2-type T cell immune response in mice. The recombinant vaccine rSC0012(pS-SaoA) conferred high percentage of protection against S. suis or S. Choleraesuis challenge in BALB/C mice. CONCLUSIONS: The live-attenuated Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis vaccine rSC0012(pS-SaoA) with regulated delayed fur mutation provides a foundation for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against S. Choleraesuis and S. suis.

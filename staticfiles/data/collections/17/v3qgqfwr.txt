Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. It has been spread to more than 100 countries and more than 1 million patients have been confirmed. Although coronavirus causes severe respiratory infections in human, accumulating data have demonstrated cardiac complications and poor outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. A large percent of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and they are at a high risk of developing cardiac complications. We review the basics of the virus, the clinical manifestation, and the possible mechanisms of cardiac complications in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Before the effective vaccine or medicine is available, supportive therapy and identifying patients who are at high risk of cardiac complications are important.

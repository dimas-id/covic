We describe an overweight COVID-19 patient with respiratory distress preceded by anosmia/dysgeusia with no lung injury shown on CT, angio-CT or ventilation/perfusion scans. Orthopnoea and paradoxical abdominal respiration were identified. Phrenic paralysis, demonstrated by examination of patient breathing, and on x-ray while standing breathing in and out, explained the respiratory distress. This is a rare and previously undescribed neurological complication of COVID-19 infection caused by vagus nerve injury. LEARNING POINTS: Phrenic paralysis must be kept in mind as a rare neurological complication of COVID-19. Vagus nerve palsy is a neurological manifestation as anosmia and dysgeusia, that were already identified in the olfactory system of COVID-19 patients.

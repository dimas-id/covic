Air pollution has happened to be one of the mounting alarms to be concerned with in many Indian cities. COVID-19 epidemic endow with a unique opportunity to report the degree of air quality improvement due to the nationwide lockdown in 10 most polluted cities across the country. National Air Quality Index (NAQI) based on continuous monitoring records of seven criteria pollutants (i.e. common air pollutants with known health impacts e.g. PM(10), PM(2.5), CO, NO(2), SO(2), NH(3) and O(3)) for a total of 59 stations across the cities, satellite image derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and few statistical tools are employed to derive the outcomes. NAQI results convey that 8 cities out of the 10 air quality restored to good to satisfactory category during the lockdown period. Within week+1 of the lockdown period, PM(10) and PM(2.5) concentrations have suppressed below the permissible limit in all cities. CO and NO(2) have reduced to about -30% and -57% respectively during the lockdown period. Diurnal concentrations of PM(10) and PM(2.5) have dropped drastically on the very 4(th) day of lockdown and become consistent with minor hourly vacillation. In April 2020 the AOD amount was reduced to about 36% and 18% in contrast to April 2018 and April 2019 respectively. This add-on reporting of the possible recovery extent in air quality may help to guide alternative policy intervention in form of short term lockdown so as to testify whether this type of unconventional policy decisions may be put forward to attain a green environment.. Because, despite numerous restoration plans, air pollution levels have risen unabated in these cities. However, detailed inventory needs to be focused on identifying the localized pollution hotspots (i.e. source contribution).

Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) usually co-infect pigs in modern large-scale piggery, which both can cause severe diarrhea in newborn piglets and lead to significant economic losses to the pig industry. The VP7 protein is the main coat protein of PoRV, and the S protein is the main structural protein of PEDV, which are capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo. In this study, a DNA vaccine pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S co-expressing VP7 protein of PoRV and S protein of PEDV was constructed. Six 8-week-old mice were immunized with the recombinant plasmid pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S. The high humoral immune responses (virus specific antibody) and cellular immune responses (IFN-γ, IL-4, and spleen lymphocyte proliferation) were evaluated. The immune effect through intramuscular injection increased with plasmid dose when compared with subcutaneous injection. The immune-enhancing effect of IFN-α adjuvant was excellent compared with pig spleen transfer factor and IL-12 adjuvant. These results demonstrated that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S possess the immunological functions of the VP7 proteins of PoRV and S proteins of PEDV, indicating that pPI-2.EGFP.VP7.S is a candidate vaccine for porcine rotaviral infection (PoR) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED).

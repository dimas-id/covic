We read with interest the recent papers by Brenner and Cimolai regarding the therapeutic potential of memantine for coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In this retrospective, we investigated the relationship between treatment with memantine and COVID-19-associated mortality in 5,726 patients with COVID-19, of whom 140 had died. Our analysis revealed no association between memantine treatment and mortality in patients with COVID-19. However, we must explore all feasible options for preventing and treating COVID-19 due to the current lack of licensed vaccines or therapeutics for the disease.

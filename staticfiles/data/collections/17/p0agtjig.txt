Plant-based vaccines have been produced in transgenic plants including tobacco, potatoes, corn, and rice. However, these plants are not suitable for administration without cooking. To overcome this obstacle, a fusion gene encoding the synthetic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit genetically fused with a synthetic neutralizing epitope of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (sLTB-sCOE) was introduced into lettuce cells (Lactuca sativa) by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods. The integration and expression of the sLTB-sCOE fusion gene was confirmed in transgenic lettuce by genomic DNA PCR amplification and Northern blot analysis, respectively. Synthesis and assembly of the LTB-COE fusion protein into oligomeric structures with pentamer size were observed in transgenic plant extracts by Western blot analysis with anti-LTB or anti-COE antibodies. The binding of plantproduced LTB-COE to intestinal epithelial cell membrane glycolipid receptors was confirmed by G(M1)-ganglioside enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (G(M1)-ELISA). Based on the ELISA results, LTB-COE fusion protein made up about 0.026âˆ¼0.048% of the total soluble protein in the transgenic lettuce leaf tissues. The synthesis and assembly of LTB-COE monomers into biologically active oligomers in transgenic lettuce leaf tissues demonstrates the feasibility of using uncooked edible plant-based vaccines for mucosal immunization.

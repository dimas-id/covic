We report a child with short stature since birth who was otherwise well, presenting at 2.8 years with progressive granulomatous skin lesions when diagnosed with severe T cell immunodeficiency. When previously investigated for short stature, and at the time of current investigations, she had no radiological skeletal features characteristics for cartilage hair hypoplasia, but we found a disease causing RMRP (RNase mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease) gene mutation. Whilst search for HLA matched unrelated donor for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was underway, she developed rapidly progressive EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorder requiring laparotomy and small bowel resection, and was treated with anti-B cell monoclonal antibody and eventually curative allogeneic HSCT. Screening for RMRP gene mutations should be part of immunological evaluation of patients with ‘severe and/or combined’ T cell immunodeficiency of unknown origin, especially when associated with short stature and regardless of presence or absence of radiological skeletal features.

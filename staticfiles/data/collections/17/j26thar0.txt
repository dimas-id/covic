Object detection is considered as the cornerstone of many modern applications such as Drone vision and Self-driven cars. Object detectors, mainly those which are based on Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs) have received great attention from many researchers because they were able to yield remarkable results. However, most of them fail when it comes to detecting overlapping and small objects in images. There are two families of detectors: the first family detects more objects but with imprecise bounding boxes, while those of the second family do the opposite. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by combining the two families, in a way similar to classifier combination. Our solution has been validated through the combination of two famous detectors, Faster R-CNN which detects more objects and YOLO which produces accurate bounding boxes. However, it is more general and it can be applied to other detectors. The evaluation of our method has been applied to the PASCAL VOC dataset and it gave promising results.

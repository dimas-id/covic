OBJECTIVE We aimed to investigate the use of single-port laparoscopy in a series of patients undergoing Burch colposuspension with an extraperitoneal approach as an alternative treatment for scarless surgery in stress urinary incontinence. MATERIAL AND METHODS From September 2010 to May 2011 we performed single-port extraperitoneal laparoscopic Burch colposuspension for stress incontinence in 15 patients. Fifteen women who were diagnosed with urodynamic stress incontinence were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data, intraoperative findings, and postoperative course were recorded. RESULTS The mean age was 45,80 ± 9,91 years (range: 38-70 years). The mean body mass index was 25,67 ± 4.06 kg/m2 (range: 22.23-35.38 kg/m(2)). The mean operation time and mean blood loss were 40.80 ± 5.94 minutes (range: 30-50 minutes) and 30.67 ± 11.00 cc (range: 10-50 cc), respectively. The single-port laparoscopic operations were technically completed successfully without placement of additional trocars and there were no complications. The cure and improvement rates following laparoscopic Burch colposuspension via single port were 73.3 % and 20 % respectively. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic Burch can be an alternative treatment for scarless surgery in stress incontinence. Single-incision laparoscopic Burch colposuspension can offer suitable, effective and safe treatment in women with stress incontinence.

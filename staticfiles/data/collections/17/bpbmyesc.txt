Otolaryngologic procedures are commonly performed on children. In fact, pressure equalizing tube placement (ear tubes) and adenotonsillectomy are among the most frequent surgical interventions in the pediatric population. Therefore, every anesthesiologist who manages children undergoing otolaryngologic procedures must be familiar with the special implications of sharing the pediatric airway with an otolaryngologist working in the head and neck region. In addition, it is imperative to be skilled in the challenges of compassionately yet safely managing anxious young patients and their parents from the time of preoperative assessment until discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.

Invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) by viral agents typically produces a meningoencephalitis in which either meningitis or encephalitis may predominate. Viruses may also infect cranial or spinal blood vessels to produce ischemic injury. Viral and other infections may also elicit a host immune response which is cross-reactive with components of the neural tissue, resulting in encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, injury to peripheral nerves, or optic neuritis. This chapter discusses the pathogenesis of CNS viral infections and reviews clinical features of these disorders, major agents responsible in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals, and treatment. Prion diseases and postinfectious viral CNS syndromes including postinfectious encephalomyelitis, acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, and transverse myelitis are also discussed.

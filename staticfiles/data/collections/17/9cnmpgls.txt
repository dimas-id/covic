Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) exhibit immune dysregulation, but the precise immunological profile and the effect of hemodialysis (HD) on it has not been investigated fully. Thirty-eight ESRD patients (22 on HD and 16 in pre-dialysis) and 24 healthy volunteers were included. We compared the T cell immune profiles as in these patients. Among the effector T cell subset, the percentages of Th17 and Th2 cells were significantly higher in the ESRD group than in the healthy controls (P<0.05). The percentage of Th1 cells did not differ significantly between these groups. The percentages of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells did not differ significantly (P>0.05) between the two subgroups within the ESRD group. The CCR4(-)CCR6(+)/CD4(+) T cell percentage was also significantly higher in the ESRD group. The naïve T cell (T(naïve)) percentage was significantly lower in the ESRD group, and the difference between patients and controls was greater in the pre-dialysis patients than in the HD patients (P<0.05, for each comparison). By contrast, the percentages of central memory T cells (T(CM)) and effector memory T (T(EM)) cells were significantly higher in the ESRD group. Interleukin-17 production by T(EM) cells was significantly higher in the ESRD group. The severity of uremia was related negatively to the T(naïve) cell percentage but positively to the T(CM) and T(EM) cell percentages. The percentages of T(EM) and CD45RA(+) T effector memory subsets of CD8(+) T cells were significantly higher in the ESRD group (P<0.05). The result of this study showed significantly altered T cell-associated immunity and that it could not be corrected with hemodialysis.

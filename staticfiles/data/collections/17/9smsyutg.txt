Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has an overwhelming impact on the nursing profession. Nurses play a vital role before and during pandemics, with nurse leaders taking the lead in preparation for outbreaks. In response to an outbreak, early recognition and preparation for the increasing threat, managing staffing challenges together with the well-being of nurses are of utmost importance. Strategies to promote physical distancing while not compromising continuing nursing education and patient care are also essential. With prompt actions and coordinated efforts, risk of spreading the virus within the healthcare sector can be kept at the minimum. As nurses are in the frontline of healthcare, their confidence in being well-supported by the hospital should be maintained. This case report describes the preparation and response of the nurses in Singapore General Hospital to the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore.

Ten colostrum-deprived calves were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (5 calves/group), and fed colostrum that had either low (naturally infected cows) or high (immunized cows) antibody titers to bovine coronavirus (BCV). All calves were inoculated orally and intranasally with virulent BCV when they were 24 to 48 hours old and challenge exposed 21 days later. Blood, feces, nasal secretions, tears, saliva, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected weekly from each calf for 5 weeks after inoculation. The titers to whole BCV or the relative amounts of isotype-specific antibodies to BCV structural proteins were evaluated in these samples by ELISA or immunoblotting, respectively. Both pools of colostrum contained primarily IgG1, IgG2, and IgA antibodies to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins. Calves fed the high-titer colostrum had correspondingly higher amounts of passive IgG1 and IgA antibodies to whole BCV and to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins in serum, feces, and BAL fluid at postinoculation week 1 than those calves fed low-titer colostrum. Active IgG1, IgA, and IgM antibody responses in serum and active IgA and IgM antibody responses in most mucosal secretions to whole BCV and to the E2 and E3 proteins were lower or delayed in calves fed high-titer colostrum, compared with responses in calves fed low-titer colostrum. In contrast, increased responses to the BCV N protein were observed in all samples (except in serum and BAL fluid) in the calves fed high-titer colostrum, compared with calves fed low-titer colostrum. Upon challenge exposure, responses to E2 and E3 BCV proteins in serum and BAL fluid were lower in the group fed high-titer colostrum, compared with those in the group fed low-titer colostrum. Our findings indicate that the level of passive immunity in calves at the time of BCV inoculation can influence the development of active antibody responses in serum, feces, and mucosal secretions to whole BCV and to some BCV proteins individually.

Abstract Health professionals participating in multidisciplinary team (MDT) cancer meetings may not be aware of their medicolegal obligations. This commentary aims to identify medicolegal issues concerning multidisciplinary cancer care and provides recommendations for future implementation. Predominant medicolegal issues related to MDT care were identified in the literature and include: patient consent and privacy at MDT meeting, professional liability, formal expression of dissenting views, and duty of care. Analysis of the literature prioritises several recommendations for managing these issues. With limited precedent on which to base recommendations, this article identifies the formative evidence that may guide management of these issues in future MDT practice.

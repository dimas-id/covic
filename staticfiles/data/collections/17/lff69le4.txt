This study included data from 676 cats in southwestern Poland examined between 2006 and 2010. Examinations were performed to diagnose the following infections: feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline herpesvirus (FHV). The presence of antibodies or antigens was assessed in samples from all cats. Among examined cats, 46.9% were positive for FCV, 50% for FHV, and 38.5% for FCoV. Retroviral infections were detected more rarely: FeLV in 6.4% and FIV in 4.3% of cases.

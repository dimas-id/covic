Annual epidemics of influenza virus infection are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality, and pandemics are much more devastating. Considerable knowledge of viral infectivity and replication has been acquired, but many details still have to be elucidated and the virus remains a challenging target for drug design and development. This review provides an overview of the antiviral drugs targeting the influenza viral replicative cycle. Included are a brief description of their chemical syntheses and biological activities.

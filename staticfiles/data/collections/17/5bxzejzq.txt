Abstract Background The relative impact of human rhino/enteroviruses (HRV/EV) compared to influenza viruses on hospitalized children is unknown. Objectives This retrospective study compared the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with HRV/EV to patients hospitalized with influenza virus. Study design Respiratory specimens from hospitalized children submitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009 to Children's Hospital Colorado Virology Laboratory in Aurora, CO were tested by a commercial multiplex PCR for 16 respiratory viruses and subtypes. Patients with specimens positive for HRV/EV or influenza virus without bacterial or viral co-infection were selected for retrospective chart review. Results Of the 2299 patients with specimens tested during the study period, 427 (18.6%) were singly positive for HRV/EV and 202 (8.8%) for influenza virus (p <0.01). Children with HRV/EV were more likely to present with increased work of breathing (67.9% vs. 52.5%, p <0.01) with crackles (36.3% vs. 23.3%, p <0.01) and wheezing (41.7% vs. 22.8%, p <0.01) noted on exam. Children hospitalized with HRV/EV had a shorter median length of stay (2 days vs. 3 days, p <0.01), duration of fever (1 days vs. 3 days, p <0.01), and duration of hypoxemia (2 days vs. 3 days, p <0.01) than children with influenza virus. Similar percentages of children with HRV/EV and influenza virus were admitted to the PICU and required positive pressure ventilation. There were no deaths in children hospitalized with HRV/EV, whereas 6 children with influenza virus expired. Conclusions HRV/EVs are common pathogens in hospitalized children associated with serious lower respiratory tract disease and significant morbidity, similar to influenza viruses.

We evaluated antigen detection kits for human rotavirus with regard to their usefulness for diagnosing equine rotavirus infection. Limiting dilution analyses showed that of the seven kits investigated the Dipstick `Eiken' Rota (Dipstick) had the highest sensitivity to two serotypes of equine rotavirus. The Dipstick did not cross-react with several equine intestinal pathogens. An investigation using 249 fecal samples indicated that the sensitivity of the Dipstick was 81.9% and 47.3%, and its specificity was 98.2% and 99.0%, and its concordance rate was 92.8% and 68.3%, compared with values obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, respectively. Although a negative result does not preclude the possibility of equine rotavirus infection, the Dipstick would be useful as routine test for diagnosing equine rotavirus infection in daily clinical practice because of its ease of handling.

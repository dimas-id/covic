We report a very rare case of complex upper extralobar pulmonary sequestration, detected during pregnancy and resected early because the diagnosis was uncertain (possibility of a teratoma). At 2 months, the upper left pulmonary lesion was completely removed by thoracoscopy. Pathology concluded an extralobar sequestration associated with a duplication cyst of mixed bronchogenic and esophageal type. The postoperative course was uneventful. The early thoracoscopic approach in this type of antenatally diagnosed lesion was a good option.

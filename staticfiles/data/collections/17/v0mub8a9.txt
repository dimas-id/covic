By 25th April 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused 2719897 confirmed cases and 187705 deaths globally, remarkably more than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (8273 cases, 775 deaths) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (1139 cases, 431 deaths) in 2003 and 2013, respectively. Gynecology is a specialty department with a large number of critical and severe patients. Consequently, it is of preeminent importance to formulate the in-patient management process. Rearranging the gynecological wards and managing ward partition, as well as the medical protection measures in specialized areas, are suitable for the current prevention and control for COVID-19 pandemic and the therapeutic requirements of patients. To effectively minimize nosocomial infections during the COVID- 19 pandemic period, our department implemented a novel prevention strategy based on the ward redesign and partition management. With this model, our department effectively protected the safety and health of patients and medical care staff from cross and nosocomial infection in the hospital. Now we would like to share the experience and strategies we implemented as following.

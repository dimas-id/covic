The prototype of an ELISA kit using protein A as the second reaction reagent for mice and anti-rat IgG for rats was prepared for seromonitoring of the Sendai virus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)/sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV)/Parker's rat coronavirus (PCV) infections. The respective antigen strains and protein concentrations were Sendai virus MN strain, 2 micrograms/ml and MHV Nu-67 strain, 5 micrograms/ml. The reliability of this prototype kit was investigated in two field tests performed on a total of 10,094 mouse and rat sera from 147 institutions. The results indicated that the two types of kits for the two species of animals were highly specific, but it is necessary to increase the detection sensitivity of the MHV antigen for the MHV antibody of mice and SDAV/PCV antibodies of rats.

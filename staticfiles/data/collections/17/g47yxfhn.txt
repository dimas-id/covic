INTRODUCTION Target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest is recommended by international guidelines, which have been last updated in 2010. Here we investigate the status of implementation in a nationwide survey in Germany which took place in 2012. METHODS We conducted a nationwide telephone survey including a total of 951 German intensive care units (ICUs). ICUs were identified by using the online registry for hospitals in Germany. A questionnaire was used for the interview about basic data of the intensive care unit and about details concerning use and implementation of TTM after cardiac arrest. RESULTS The overall response rate was 91% (865/951). 86% (742/865) of ICUs used TTM after cardiac arrest and implementation peaked in 2010. 95% (702/736) of the ICUs using TTM perform treatment independently of the initial rhythm and 48% (355/738) apply TTM with the use of a feedback device for cooling and controlled re-warming. However, 22% (166/742) still use conventional methods like ice and cold infusion and only 61% (453/742) of the participants provided a written standard operating procedure (SOP). CONCLUSION With a delay of several years, TTM after cardiac arrest is now implemented in the majority of German ICUs. The moderate proportion of ICUs using SOPs for TTM and feedback-controlled cooling devices indicates the need of further improvement in post cardiac arrest care.

BACKGROUND Oral anticoagulation therapy was the mainstay of deep vein thrombosis treatment but recently, catheter-directed thrombolysis has emerged as an alternative. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of the two strategies. METHODS Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL were reviewed. Outcomes of interest included post-thrombotic syndrome, thromboembolic events, mortality, bleeding risk and iliofemoral patency. A random effects model meta-analysis was performed. Heterogeneity was assessed with I square. RESULTS Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1005 patients met the inclusion criteria. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was more likely to prevent overall post-thrombotic syndrome compared to anticoagulation only (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12-0.85; I2=87.2%), and to lead to iliofemoral vein patency (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.08-6.75; I2=55.3%) but no difference was noted in thromboembolic events (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.08-3.02, I2=55.1%), bleeding and mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS Catheter-directed thrombolysis can decrease post-thrombotic syndrome rates and improve iliofemoral vein patency compared to anticoagulation when used for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis.

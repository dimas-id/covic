The author retraces the history of "biotechnology" and the successive stages of its application in veterinary sciences. An inventory is given of potential applications in animal health (diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases), genetics, animal reproduction (direct and indirect contributions) and nutrition (at the levels of fodder plants, fermentation or prefermentation of feed, and animal metabolism). The control of biotechnological procedures is discussed, with reference to categories of risk and ways of averting risk, and control at national and international levels. There is growing interest in the application of biotechnology to animal reproduction and to the diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases, but developing ways to prevent disease is slow because considerable time is needed to evaluate risks.

A series of thiosemicarbazones and their platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes have been synthesized. The chemical structures of ligands and their complexes were characterized by UVâ€“Vis, IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS spectra, elemental analysis and TGA. The antiviral and cytotoxic activities of all compounds have been tested. Results of broad antiviral evaluation showed that none of the compounds evaluated endowed with anti-DNA or -RNA virus activity at subtoxic concentrations except for the palladium complex 1b. This compound exhibited slightly selective inhibition against cytomegalovirus. The platinum complex 4a exhibited the best cytostatic activities against human cervix carcinoma. Ligands 2, 4 and 5 showed cytostatic potential. The palladium complexes were in general less cytostatic than the corresponding platinum complexes or unliganded congeners.

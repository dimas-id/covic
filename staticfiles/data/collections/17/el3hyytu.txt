OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a totally endoscopic enteral bypass using a self-orienting, dual ring, magnetic anastomosis system (MAGNAMOSIS) guided by a magnetic tracking system (3D METRIS). MATERIALS AND METHODS In an anesthetized pig, 2 endoscopes were advanced, one each into the stomach and the colon. Both endoscopes were equipped with a MAGNAMOSIS ring secured with an endoscopic snare and a 3D METRIS within one working channel. The whole procedure was followed laparoscopically. The tracking system guided tips of endoscopes to a "rendez-vous" location between the colon and stomach. RESULTS MAGNAMOSIS magnets automatically joined in the correct configuration when guided to within 2 cm of each other. At necropsy, magnetic rings were secure without entrapment of excess bowel or mesentery. CONCLUSION An endoscopic enteral bypass with magnetic anastomosis and magnetic tracking device was feasible. More accurate tracking and advanced techniques could enable endoscopic bypasses at multiple sites in the gastrointestinal tract.

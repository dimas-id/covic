Infectious bronchitis is one of the most important diseases in poultry and it causes major economic losses. Infectious bronchitis is an acute, highly contagious, viral disease of chickens, characterized by rales, coughing, and sneezing. Because secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) are involved in inflammatory processes, the gene expressions of sPLA2s were investigated in both healthy chickens and chickens with infectious bronchitis and lung inflammation. The draft chicken genome was first scanned using human sPLA2 sequences to identify chicken sPLA2s (ChPLA2), chicken total mRNA were isolated and RT-PCR experiments were performed to amplify and then sequence orthologous cDNAs. Full-length cDNA sequences of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIE, -V and -X were cloned. The high degree of sequence identity of 50â€“70% between the avian and mammalian (human and mouse) sPLA2 orthologs suggests a conservation of important enzymatic functions for these phospholipases. Quantitation by qPCR of the transcript levels of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA, -IIE, -V and -X in several tissues from healthy chicken indicated that the expression patterns and mRNA levels diverged among the phospholipases tested. In chicken with infectious bronchitis, an over expression of ChPLA2-V was observed in lungs and spleen in comparison with healthy chicken. These findings suggest that ChPLA2-V could be a potential biomarker for lung inflammation. Conversely, a down regulation of ChPLA2-IB, -IIA and -X was observed in lungs and spleen in case of infectious bronchitis. A significant increase in the expression level of ChPLA2-X and ChPLA2-IB was also noticed in pancreas. No or minor changes have been detected in the expression of ChPLA2-IIE in lungs and small intestine, but it shows a significant increase in several infected tissues.

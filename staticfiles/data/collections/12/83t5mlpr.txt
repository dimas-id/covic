The interaction between niclosamide (NIC) and pepsin was investigated using multispectroscopic and molecular docking methods. Binding constant, number of binding sites, and thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures were measured. Results of fluorescence quenching and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that changes occurred in the microenvironment of tryptophan residues and the molecular conformation of pepsin. Molecular interaction distance and energy-transfer efficiency between pepsin and NIC were determined based on FÃ¶rster nonradiative energy-transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the binding of NIC inhibited pepsin activity in vitro. All these results indicated that NIC bound to pepsin mainly through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds at a single binding site. In conclusion, this study provided substantial molecular-level evidence that NIC could induce changes in pepsin structure and conformation.

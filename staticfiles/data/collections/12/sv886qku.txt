Coughing is a watchdog of the lungs. It represents the most important airway defensive reflex and one of the main symptoms of respiratory disease. During coughing and sneezing, particles of mucus can be expelled for a distance of up to 9 m [1]. Various pathogens, if present, may therefore, infect nearby people and animals, contributing to massive dissemination of airborne infections. In addition to using various protective measures, down-regulation of coughing plays a substantial role in preventing dissemination of respiratory infections. For example, about 80 % of passengers on a 3-h airplane trip may be infected by the cough of an individual carrying the flu virus. These newly infected passengers then disseminate the viral infection at their destinations worldwide.

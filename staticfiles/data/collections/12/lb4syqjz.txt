Many airway diseases in children, notably bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis including primary ciliary dyskinesia, pneumonia, and severe asthma are associated with retention of airway secretions. Medications to improve secretions clearance, the mucoactive medications, are employed to treat these diseases with varying degrees of success. This manuscript reviews evidence for the use of these medications and future directions of study.

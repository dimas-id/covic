PURPOSE We aimed to assess whether insulating covers and warming systems cause artifacts in fluoroscopy, and whether they alter the radiation dose. METHODS Eight insulating and warming systems were wrapped around the phantom in order to obtain images in fluoroscopy, and to measure the absorbed and scattered radiation dose. A dosimeter, endovascular catheters, and stents were placed into a phantom. The other dosimeter was placed outside of a C-arm table, at the operator's and anesthesiologist's locations. RESULTS Most of the insulating covers did not cause artifacts in the fluoroscopy and led to a significant decrease in both the absorbed and scattered radiation dose. The highest decrease in the absorbed dose was observed with metalized foil (- 2.09%; p = 0.001) and in the scattered dose with Helios cover (- 55%; p < 0.001). Only one heating system (Ready Heat combined with Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit cover) caused significant artifacts and increased radiation up to 99% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Thermal insulation may be maintained during X-ray-guided emergency endovascular procedures in trauma victims. Self-heating blankets should be replaced with another warming system.

In the frame of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, recent reports on SARS-CoV-2 potential neuroinvasion placed neurologists on increased alertness in order to assess early neurological manifestations and their potentially prognostic value for the COVID-19 disease. Moreover, the management of chronic neurological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), underwent guided modifications, such as an Extended Interval Dose (EID) of Disease-Modifying Treatment (DMT) administration, in order to minimize patientsâ€™ exposure to the health system, thus reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this review, we summarize existing evidence of key immune pathways that the SARS-CoV-2 modifies during COVID-19 and the relevant implication for MS and other autoimmune diseases with associated demyelination (such as Systemic lupus erythematosus and Antiphospholipid syndrome), including the context of potential neuroinvasion by SARS-Cov-2 and the alterations that DMT induces to the immune system. Moreover we hereby aim to provide an overview of the possible consequences that COVID-19 may carry for the Central Nervous System (CNS) in People with MS (PwMS) and other demyelinating diseases, which are likely to pose challenges for treating Neurologists with respect to the long-term disease management of these diseases.

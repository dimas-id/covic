BACKGROUND Single-site laparoscopic surgery and natural orifice transumbilical surgery (NOTUS) have become exciting areas of surgical development. However, most reported case series consist of basic laparoscopic procedures, such as cholecystectomy and appendectomy. In this paper, we present the case of an advanced laparoscopic operation-construction of a gastrointestinal anastomosis-that was performed through ports placed entirely within the umbilicus. METHODS In this paper, we describe a 61-year-old male with a history of advanced pancreatic carcinoma who was referred with a gastric outlet obstruction. A laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy bypass, using a linear stapler with suture closure of the enterotomy, was performed through three abdominal trocars placed entirely within the umbilicus. Some potential advantages of NOTUS palliative gastrojejunostomy include reduced postoperative pain and the lack of visible abdominal scars. RESULTS The operation was completed uneventfully in 40 minutes. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on postoperative day 2. At 1-month follow-up, the patient had improved oral intake without any further vomiting symptoms. CONCLUSION This case report documents the feasibility of an advanced anastomotic gastrojejunostomy procedure which can be performed through a single site. However, benefits of this approach, compared to conventional laparoscopic procedures, will require a prospective randomized clinical trial.

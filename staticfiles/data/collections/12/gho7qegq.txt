With the development of the boron industry, boron pollution is getting more and more serious, and excessive boron will harm human health. In this paper, graphene oxide was used as a template to prepare ZIF-67, and GO/ZIF-67 was successfully prepared. GO/ZIF-67 was used for the first time to remove boron from water. SEM, XRD, and other characterization methods were used to confirm the structure. The adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, adsorption thermodynamics, and adsorption mechanism of boron by GO/ZIF-67 were studied in this paper. The adsorption capacity of GO/ZIF-67 for boron is up to 66.65 mg·g-1 at 25 °C, and adsorption process reaches equilibrium in 400 min. Adsorption kinetics indicates that the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and adsorption thermodynamics indicates that the adsorption process is a spontaneous endothermic process controlled by entropy change. The adsorption capacity of boron by GO/ZIF-67 does not decrease significantly after four cycles. The adsorption of boron by GO/ZIF-67 has both chemical and physical adsorption. From Zeta potential and adsorption kinetics, it can be seen that there is physical adsorption during the adsorption process and boron mainly has positive charge on the surface of GO/ZIF-67 and graphene oxide hydroxyl bonding. Based on the adsorption thermodynamics and XPS, it is known that there is chemisorption during the adsorption process, and mainly the combination of boron and cobalt sites.

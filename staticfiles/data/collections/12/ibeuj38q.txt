CASE An extensive iliofemoral-popliteal deep venous thrombosis following arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction presented on the ninth postoperative day as the result of underlying May-Thurner syndrome. The patient was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation and mechanical disruption of the thrombus. The focal stenosis of the left common iliac vein was addressed with angioplasty and stent placement. Repeat venography demonstrated no residual stenosis of the vein. CONCLUSION A multidisciplinary approach remains necessary for treating and reducing the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome. The present case further emphasizes the need for aggressive workup and response when a patient presents with left-sided deep venous thrombosis associated with underlying May-Thurner syndrome.

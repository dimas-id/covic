Abstract At least eight viruses have been identified, four within the last 5 yr, that produce diarrhea and pathological intestinal lesions in experimentally inoculated calves. Coronavirus and rotavirus frequently are associated with the neonatal calf diarrhea syndrome, but the etiologic role of the newly identified viruses is undefined. All diarrheal viruses replicate within small intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in variable degrees of villous atrophy. Immunity against these viral infections, therefore, must be directed toward protection of the susceptible intestinal epithelial cells. Because most of these viral infections occur in calves<3 wk of age, passive lactogenic immunity within the gut lumen plays an important role in protection. This report reviews methods of boosting rotavirus antibody responses in bovine mammary secretions and analyses of passive and active immunity in calves supplemented with colostrum and challenged by rotavirus. Results indicate rotavirus immunoglobulin G1 antibodies in colostrum and milk were elevated after intramuscular and intramammary vaccination of pregnant cows with an Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center rotavirus vaccine but not after intramuscular immunization with a commercial rota-coronavirus vaccine. Feeding colostrum from intramuscular plus intramammary immunized cows to newborn calves challenged by rotavirus prevented diarrhea and shedding of rotavirus.

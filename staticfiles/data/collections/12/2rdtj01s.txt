The fight against global poverty has gained momentum following the creation of the Millennium Development Goals, which aim to halve extreme poverty by 2015.

Yet, knowledge of ecosystem functions and processes can be applied to improve the lives of millions of people, suffering from hunger, lacking clean drinking water and reliable, efficient energy sources, dying from preventable diseases, and suffering disproportionately from natural disasters. Here, we describe ways in which ecologists can apply ecological theory and tools to help improve the efficacy of poverty alleviation programs.

In recent years, increasingly sophisticated tools have allowed for more complex robotic surgery. Robotic gastrectomy, however, is adopted in only a few selected centers. The goals of this study were to examine the adoption of robotic gastrectomy and to compare outcomes between open and robotic gastric resections. This is a case-matched analysis of patients who underwent robotic and open gastric resection performed at Sanchinarro University Hospital, Madrid from November 2011 to February 2017. Patient data were obtained retrospectively. Clinicopathologic characteristics and perioperative and postoperative outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Two groups of demographically similar patients were analyzed: the robotic group (n = 20) and the open surgery group (n = 19). The patient characteristics of the two groups have been compared. Robotic resection resulted in less blood loss, shorter postoperative hospital stay, and a longer operating time. The two groups had similar complication rates. Pathological data were similar for both procedures. Robotic gastrectomy for locally advanced gastric carcinoma is safe, and long-term outcomes are comparable to those patients who underwent open resection. Robotic gastrectomy resulted in a shorter hospital stay, less blood loss and morbidity comparable with the outcomes of open gastrectomy.

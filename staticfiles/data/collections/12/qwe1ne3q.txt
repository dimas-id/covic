Multiplexed nucleic acid-based tests for infectious disease have become a standard part of clinical laboratory practice. These tests provide a comprehensive syndrome-based approach to determine the etiological agent of disease. The technology underlying these different systems is reviewed here with a special focus on the BioFire FilmArrayÂ® platform. The literature on the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of these platforms for respiratory, blood culture, and gastrointestinal infections is discussed. Although there are reports showing a clear benefit to the patient or to the healthcare system from adopting a syndromic molecular approach, it is also apparent that clinical laboratories and healthcare providers are still learning how to take full advantage of the new systems. Finally, some improvements to this technology that should appear in the next few years are discussed. These include automated pathogen-specific surveillance based on aggregating the data from these systems, a move toward point-of-care syndromic testing, and further decreases in time to result of the tests.

The remit of this review is to provide the non-specialist reader of Avian Pathology with an overview of research carried out on infectious bronchitis over the 40 years since the journal was first published. In order to do this, we felt it necessary to summarize the knowledge acquired previously, since the since the disease was first identified in the 1930s. Infectious bronchitis virus is a significant pathogen in the domestic chicken, affecting the respiratory and renal systems as well as the female reproductive tract. The virus exists in the form of many, ever changing, serotypic or genotypic variants, some of which have global distribution whilst others are found only in more local areas. This review mentions the major discoveries concerning both the virus itself and the types of disease it causes and considers recent changes in its pathogenesis. It also discusses the impact of developments in the field of molecular biology and highlights possible areas for future work.

Transfusion of blood products may be required during the perioperative period. Despite a well-established safety record, transfusion of blood and its components is not risk free. Indication for each of the blood components needs to be established based on the laboratory investigation and/or clinical picture. In general terms, when there is a clinical evidence of a deficiency in oxygen-carrying capacity, red cell transfusion should be considered; and in the situations of clinically significant coagulopathy, hemostatic blood products (frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, factor concentrates) transfusion should be considered. Complications of blood administration range from rare but severe reactions (hemolytic transfusion reactions) to more common, and also associated with significant morbidity and mortality, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-related circulatory overload (TACO), and changes in immune system (transfusion related immunomodulation [TRIM]).

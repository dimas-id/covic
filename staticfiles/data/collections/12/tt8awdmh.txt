BACKGROUND Laparoscopic bariatric surgery is increasingly being performed worldwide. It is estimated that trocar port hernias occur more often in obese patients due to their obesity and because the ports are not closed routinely. The aim of the present study was to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and management of patients with trocar port hernias after laparoscopic bariatric surgery. METHODS All patients who were operated between 2006 and 2013 were included. During the study period, the trocar ports were not closed routinely. All patients who had any symptomatic abdominal wall hernia during follow-up were included. RESULTS Overall, 1524 laparoscopic bariatric procedures were performed. There were 1249 female (82 %) and 275 male (18 %) patients. The mean age was 44 years, and median body mass index was 43 kg/m(2). Patients underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) (n = 859), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) (n = 364), laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) (n = 68), revisional surgery (n = 226), and other procedures (n = 7). Three hundred and one patients (20 %) had one or more postoperative complications and the overall mortality was 0.3 % (four patients). There were 14 patients (0.9 %) with an abdominal wall hernia, of which eight (0.5 %) had a trocar port hernia, three (0.2 %) an incisional hernia from other previous surgery, and three (0.2 %) an umbilical hernia. Gender, age, BMI, smoking, type II diabetes, procedure type, complications, and weight loss were not associated with the occurrence of abdominal wall hernias. CONCLUSIONS Trocar port hernias after bariatric surgery occur seldom if the trocar port is not routinely closed.

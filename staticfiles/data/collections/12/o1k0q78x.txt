Abstract Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel virus which can cause respiratory tract disease in infants or children. In this study, the codon usage bias and the base composition variations in the available 11 complete HBoV genome sequences have been investigated. Although, there is a significant variation in codon usage bias among different HBoV genes, codon usage bias in HBoV is a little slight, which is mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. The results of correspondence analysis (COA) and Spearman's rank correlation analysis reveals that the G+C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in HBoV and the gene's function also contributes to the codon usage in this virus. Moreover, it was found that the hydrophobicity of each protein and the gene length are also critical in affecting these viruses’ codon usage, although they were less important than that of the mutational bias and the genes’ function. At last, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of 44 genes from these 11 HBoV isolates is analyzed using a hierarchical cluster method. The result suggests that genes with same function yet from different isolates are classified into the same lineage and it does not depend on geographical location. These conclusions not only can offer an insight into the codon usage patterns and gene classification of HBoV, but also may help in increasing the efficiency of gene delivery/expression systems.

Abstract Heparin is one of the main pharmaceutical products manufactured from raw animal material. In order to describe the viral burden associated with this raw material, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on mucus samples destined for heparin manufacturing, which were collected from European pigs. We identified Circoviridae and Parvoviridae members as the most prevalent contaminating viruses, together with viruses from the Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, and Anelloviridae families. Putative new viral species were also identified. The load of several known or novel small non-enveloped viruses, which are particularly difficult to inactivate or eliminate during heparin processing, was quantified by qPCR. Analysis of the combined HTS and specific qPCR results will influence the refining and validation of inactivation procedures, as well as aiding in risk analysis of viral heparin contamination.

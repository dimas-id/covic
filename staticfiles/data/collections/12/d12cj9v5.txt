BACKGROUND: Initial trials of lung-targeted budesonide (0.25 mg/kg) in surfactant to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature infants have shown benefit; however, the optimal safe dose is unknown. METHODS: Dose-escalation study of budesonide (0.025, 0.05, 0.10 mg/kg) in calfactatant in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) requiring intubation at 3âˆ’14 days. Tracheal aspirate (TA) cytokines, blood budesonide concentrations, and untargeted blood metabolomics were measured. Outcomes were compared with matched infants receiving surfactant in the Trial Of Late SURFactant (TOLSURF). RESULTS: Twenty-four infants with mean gestational age 25.0 weeks and 743 g birth weight requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled at mean age 6 days. Budesonide was detected in the blood of all infants with a half-life of 3.4 h. Of 11 infants with elevated TA cytokine levels at baseline, treatment was associated with sustained decrease (mean 65%) at all three dosing levels. There were time- and dose-dependent decreases in blood cortisol concentrations and changes in total blood metabolites. Respiratory outcomes did not differ from the historic controls. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide/surfactant had no clinical respiratory benefit at any dosing levels for intubated ELGANs. One-tenth the dose used in previous trials had minimal systemic metabolic effects and appeared effective for lung-targeted anti-inflammatory action.

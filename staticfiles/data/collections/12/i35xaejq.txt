Recycled water, the secondary water source of a city, is vital to alleviate regional water resource shortage and promote environmental conservation. The attitude and acceptance toward recycled water of the public, its direct user, hold the key to the implementation of a recycled water project. Currently, the public’s low intention of using recycled water constitutes the biggest obstacle to its popularization. To identify the factors of public acceptance of recycled water and their influence path, this study analyzes the effect mechanism of information disclosure of recycled water on the public’s acceptance of it based on the consciousness-context-behavior theory and by adopting a structural equation model. The results are as follows: (1) The public’s consciousness of water saving, risk perception of recycled water, and consciousness of environmental responsibility can effectively promote public acceptance of recycled water; (2) The consciousness of water saving and that of environmental responsibility have a significant effect on public acceptance of recycled water, and so do the consciousness of water saving and the risk perception of recycled water; and (3) Recycled water information disclosure has the most significant regulatory effect on consciousness and public acceptance.

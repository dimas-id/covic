Biological risks were mentioned by the “European Agency for Safety and Health, at Work’s Expert Forecast on Emerging Biological Risks related to Occupational Safety and Health”, the second most important emerging risk. In an era when the “one health approach” is considered the right way to address public health issues occupational safety continues to look at biological agents as a minor issue compared to other agents. The food industry is known to be very committed to food safety assurance but less concerned with the safety of food operators unless they may compromise the quality of the food product. However, the focus on biological agents is essential not only due to air spread or contact with organic dust but we must not overlook another crucial aspect which is the antimicrobial resistance that may be associated with biological agents, nowadays one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development.

The use of both rhesus monkey kidney and human fetal diploid cell cultures for attempts to isolate virus from human clinical specimens recovered approximately 30% more isolates from fecal, throat, skin lesion, and tissue specimens than were recovered in a single cell culture system. The sensitivities of the two cell types for isolation of viruses in the major groups infecting man are compared. The use of both BS-C-1 and RK-13 cells yielded approximately 25% more rubella virus isolates than were recovered in a single cell system. Procedures such as the establishment of cell cultures from tissues suspected of harboring viruses, cocultivation of cells from biopsy or autopsy specimens with other cell types, and the use of organ cultures, have in certain situations resulted in greater sensitivity for recovery of viruses. Micro cell culture tests have been devised for virus identification and antibody assays; these are far more economical than conventional tests in terms of reagents, space requirements, and personnel time. Methods have been developed for the production of higher-titered viral serologic antigens in cell culture systems.

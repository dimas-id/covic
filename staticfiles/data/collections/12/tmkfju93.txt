This report explains the employing of a combination test of traditional cell culture with a quantitative real-time PCR for assessment of the antiviral effect of zinc sulfate (ZnSO(4)) on herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected Vero cells. Our evidence showed that the treatment with 0.3 mM ZnSO(4) strongly inhibited the replication of virus progeny (MOI 0.001) at least 68-fold less. On the other hand, the IC50 demonstrated that the highest activity of ZnSO(4) was at the 0.23 mM concentration.

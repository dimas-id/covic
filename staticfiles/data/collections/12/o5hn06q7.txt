A monoclonal antibody (MAb) (Z3A5) against spike protein subunit of bovine coronavirus (BCV) reacted with the virus in formalin-fixed intestines in an immunoperoxidase test. We found an 88% correlation between immunohistochemistry with Z3A5 and in situ hybridization with a BCV nucleoprotein cDNA probe. MAb Z3A5 reacted with 90 BCV isolates from the United States and was an effective reagent for the diagnosis of BCV.

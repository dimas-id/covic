INTRODUCTION Single-access laparoscopy has garnered growing interest in recent years in an attempt to improve cosmesis, reduce postoperative pain, and minimize abdominal wall trauma. CASE DESCRIPTION A female patient suffering from a symptomatic giant biliary cyst of the liver segments 4-7-8 was admitted for transumbilical single-access laparoscopic cyst unroofing. The procedure was performed using a standard 11-mm reusable trocar for a 10-mm, 30 degree-angled, rigid scope and curved reusable instruments inserted transumbilically without trocars. Operative time was 90 minutes, and the final incision length was 14 mm. The use of minimal pain medication permitted discharge on the third postoperative day, and after 25 months, the patient remains asymptomatic with a no visible umbilical scar. CONCLUSIONS Giant biliary cysts can be removed by single-access laparoscopy. Because of this technique, surgeons work in ergonomic positions, and the cost of the procedure remains similar to that of the multitrocar technique. The incision length and the use of pain medication are kept minimal as well.

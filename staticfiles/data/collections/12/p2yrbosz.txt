The treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still empirical and controversial. Herein we report our experience in treating approximately 40 SARS children and adolescents. Treatment of SARS kidney patients is limited. Paediatric nephrologists should be on the alert for SARS in order to care for immunocompromised patients. Precautions should be made for both staff and patients with protective measures for infection control.

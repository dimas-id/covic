CASE SUMMARY An approximately 3-year-old, male domestic longhair cat was presented to a mobile veterinary unit for routine neuter. Preoperative physical examination revealed an approximately 5 cm Ã— 2 cm scab on the craniolateral portion of the left antebrachium. The cat was anesthetized for the neuter using an injectable anesthesia protocol. After castration, the wound area on the antebrachium was clipped, copiously lavaged and the wound edges were surgically debrided. Injectable antibiotics and analgesic management were instituted. The wound was conservatively managed using sugar bandaging and antibiotic dressings until the progression of healing plateaued. Procedures for closing the defect were explored, and it was decided that a single-pedicle hinge flap would be ideal. The procedure was performed on the mobile veterinary unit and managed postoperatively with pain control and biweekly bandage changes. After 3 weeks, the single-pedicle hinge flap was released to create a skin graft, which successfully filled the defect. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION Single-pedicle hinge flaps performed in feline patients have been minimally reported. This case report serves to provide detailed information on the surgical procedure and aftercare required for a successful outcome. Furthermore, this procedure was performed by a shelter medicine team in a mobile veterinary unit with no specialty equipment or instruments. This report documents an alternative procedure that may be used in a shelter environment for distal forelimb wounds rather than amputation or euthanasia.

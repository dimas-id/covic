ABSTRACT This study was performed to clarify the acute phase response following infectious bronchitis virus inoculation. Ninety clinically healthy 1-d-old Ross chicks were randomly assigned into 2 groups: control (n = 20) and infected group (n = 70). At the age of 20 d, all birds in the infected group were challenged intranasally with allantoic fluid containing 105 embryo lethal dose (ELD50)/0.1 mL of the infectious bronchitis virus. Blood samples were collected from 20 clinically healthy and 70 infected chicks at prior and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20 d postinoculation. On d 1, 7, and 11 postinoculation 4 chickens from the experimental group and 2 chickens from the control group were randomly selected. Their trachea, lungs, and cecal tonsil were collected for virus detection and quantitation by real-time reverse-transcription PCR assay. In the serum the acute phase proteins (haptoglobin and serum amyloid A), pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α), and serum sialic acid (total, TSA; lipid-bound, LBSA; and protein-bound, PBSA) concentrations were measured using validated standard procedures. All variables were significantly higher in the infected birds after virus inoculation compared with the healthy group (P < 0.05). There were positive correlations between all variables in the infected group. Correlation coefficients were significantly positive between haptoglobin and interferon-γ, LBSA and TSA, and TSA and LBSA (P < 0.05). There were positive correlations among viral RNA and all studied variables; however, these correlations were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).

Acetabuloplasty is a valuable palliative adjunct for the treatment of patients with painful metastatic disease to the pelvis in selected cases. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman with morbid obesity and with breast carcinoma who was technically difficult to treat under fluoroscopic guidance due to very poor visualization secondary to her body habitus. It was possible to perform radiofrequency ablation and acetabuloplasty with the use of cone-beam computed tomography for guidance.

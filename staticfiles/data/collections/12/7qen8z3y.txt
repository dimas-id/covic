PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modified risk products (MRP) such as electronic vaping cigarettes (EVC) and heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC) are alternatives to traditional combustion cigarettes (TCC) with an expanding consumer base. Yet, their cardiovascular health risks are still unclear. We aimed to summarize the evidence base on this topic by conducting an updated umbrella review. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified 7 systematic reviews, totaling 183 studies and reports, ranging from in vitro and in animal studies to clinical studies in apparently healthy volunteers and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Overall, acute EVC use was associated with several toxic effects at molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. In addition, EVC impacted adversely on blood pressure (BP) management, caused tachycardia, and worsened arterial stiffness. Finally, EVC use was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, even if the causal link is still debated. Most reviews highlighted that the detrimental impact of EVC was of lesser magnitude of that of TCC. In addition, the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangled. Finally, no review included studies on HNBC. SUMMARY: The present umbrella review suggests that EVC, and likely HNBC, despite clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk, may represent a temporary lesser evil than TCC in a risk-reduction or risk-modification strategy, aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine products.

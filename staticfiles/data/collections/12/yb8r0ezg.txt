Device embolization is a potentially serious complication of percutaneous vascular interventions. Various devices and techniques can be used for the retrieval procedure. Herein, we report the retrieval of a stent that slipped off the balloon in the left main coronary artery and then embolized to the right femoral artery in a 77-year-old male. The stent could not be retrieved by snare, but was removed from the coronary tree via a balloon advanced inside it. The stent then embolized into the right femoral artery. Using a balloon catheter advanced through the stent and then via a biopsy forceps advanced over a femoro-femoral wire loop, we were able to remove the stent from the patient. In conclusion, there is no proven standard method for the retrieval of embolized material. Different techniques and devices can be used depending on the creativity of the operator as well as the individual situation of the case.

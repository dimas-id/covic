In a previous report in Pediatric Dermatology, we described chilblains‚Äêlike lesions in four pediatric patients. From April 18 to May 10, 2020, 45 children presented to our Pediatric Dermatology department with similar acral lesions. The clinical appearance ranged from red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques on the heels, soles and lateral margin of the feet, often accompanied by painful edema, consistent with chilblains.

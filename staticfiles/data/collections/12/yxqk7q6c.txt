An efficient radical deoxygenation reaction of thiocarbonylimidazolyl activated glycoside analogue using dimethyl phosphite as hydrogen source and radical chain carrier was performed as a key step in a multi step synthesis towards a common 3-deoxy glycosyl donor for 3â€²-deoxynucleosides. This method has safety and cost advantages compared to the generally used radical reduction reagents.

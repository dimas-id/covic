Landfill is a public and environmental health problem; establishing and understanding methodologies to decrease its toxicity are thus necessary. Leachate samples were collected, at a sanitary landfill, immediately after the exit from the landfill, i.e. raw leachate (collection point A), after conventional treatment (point B) and after treatment by wetlands (point C). D. parodizi specimens were exposed to 3%, 10% and control (0%) dilutions of leachate from these collection points for 7 days. Markers of antioxidant defences and cell damage were analysed. At point B, the gills of D. parodizi showed higher glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity; the latter is a supplier of glutathione reductase (GSH). The low GST activity at point A was associated with the hormesis effect. Higher levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) occurred at point A. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was inhibited at the points with the highest pollutant load and at the highest leachate dilutions. Higher levels of markers at point A may be related to the high pollutant charge and specific compounds present in the untreated leachate. The multi-xenobiotic resistance mechanism (MXR), metallothionein-like proteins (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) did not vary among treatments. The biomarker responses showed negative effects of the leachate on the freshwater bivalve and simultaneously showed that the wetland treatment employed at the Caximba sanitary landfill is effective.

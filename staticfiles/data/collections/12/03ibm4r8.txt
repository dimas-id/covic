For over 60 years, the synthetic production of new DNA sequences has helped researchers understand and engineer biology. Here we summarize methods and caveats for the de novo synthesis of DNA, with particular emphasis on recent technologies that allow for large-scale and low-cost production. In addition, we discuss emerging applications enabled by large-scale de novo DNA constructs, as well as the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

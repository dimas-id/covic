The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes the unfathomable pandemic in the history of humankind. Bangladesh is also a victim of this critical situation. To investigate the genomic features of the pathogen, the first complete genome of the virus has very recently been published. Therefore, the long awaiting questions regarding the possible origin and typing of the strain(s) can now be answered. Here, we endeavor to mainly discuss the published reports or online-accessed data (results) regarding those issues and presented a comprehensive picture of the typing of the virus alongside the probable origin of the sub-clade containing Bangladeshi strain. Our observation suggested that this strain might have originated from the United Kingdom (UK) or other European countries epidemiologically linked to the UK. According to different genotyping classification schemes, this strain belongs to A2a clade under G major clade, is of B and/or L type, and is a SARS-CoV-2a sub-strain. In the forwarding days, randomized genome data will certainly voluminate in Bangladesh, however because of globalization and immigrant movements, we urgently need a mass regional sequencing approach targeting the partial or complete genome that can link the epidemiological data and may help in further clinical interventions.

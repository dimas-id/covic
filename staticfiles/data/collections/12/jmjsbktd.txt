The current unprecedented coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has accelerated and enhanced e-learning solutions. During the so-called transition phase, efforts were made to reorganize surgical services, reschedule elective surgical procedures, surgical research, academic education, and careers to optimize results. The intention to switch to e-learning medical education is not a new concern. However, the current crisis triggered an alarm to accelerate the transition. Efforts to consider e-learning as a teaching and training method for medical education have proven to be efficient. For image-guided therapies, the challenge requires more effort since surgical skills training is combined with image interpretation training, thus the challenge is to cover quality educational content with a balanced combination of blended courses (online/onsite). Several e-resources are currently available in the surgical scenario; however, further efforts to enhance the current system are required by accelerating the creation of new learning solutions to optimize complex surgical education needs in the current disrupted environment.

Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved homeostatic process by which cells deliver cytoplasmic material for degradation into lysosomes. Autophagy may have evolved as a nutrient-providing homeostatic pathway induced upon starvation, but with the acquisition of cargo-receptors autophagy has become an important cellular defence mechanism as well as a generator of antigenic peptides for MHC presentation. We propose that autophagy efficiently protects against microbes encountering the cytosolic environment accidentally, for example upon phagosomal damage, while pathogens routinely accessing the host cytosol have evolved to avoid or even benefit from autophagy.

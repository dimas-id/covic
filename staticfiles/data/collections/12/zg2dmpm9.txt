BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the two most common bariatric operations. With the implementation of enhanced recovery protocols, the use of drains should decrease. METHODS: The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database was queried for the years 2015–2017. Our inclusion criteria included all patients undergoing a primary LRYGB, SG, and revisions. We examined demographics, operative characteristics, the use of drains, and postoperative complications. Continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and proportions. Student’s T test (Wilcoxon sum rank test in the case of skewed data) and chi-squared analysis were used to assess the baseline differences in drain utilization. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2017, there were 388,239 bariatric cases performed without drains and 100,221 performed with drains. Twenty-nine percent of LRYGB patients had a drain placed but only 16.7% of SG patients. The percentage of LRYGB that had a drain dropped from 33.1 to 24.6% during the study period and that of SG dropped from 20.3 to 13.6%. Patients that had drains placed were more likely to have a provocative test at the time of surgery (prevalence ratio (PR) 2.24) and to have a postoperative swallow study (PR 1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Drains are still commonly used in bariatric patients. Over the study period, there was a decrease in the use of drains in both bypass and sleeve patients. Patients with a drain were more likely to have had a provocative test and a swallow study and have a higher rate of complications and mortality.

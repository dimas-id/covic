Inhalation of nitric oxide (NO) improved arterial oxygenation and enabled the reduction of inspired oxygen therapy and airway pressure support in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition, chest radiography showed decreased spread or density of lung infiltrates, and the physiological effects remained after termination of inhaled NO therapy. These findings suggest not only a pulmonary vasodilator effect of inhaled NO, but also an effect on SARS.

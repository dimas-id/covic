Access to electricity is an important issue in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) however its health implications are poorly understood. This paper systematically reviews the health effects of access to electricity and develops a conceptual model to summarise the pathways through which these effects may occur. The databases CINAHL, Embase, and MEDLINE were searched for studies examining the effects of access to electricity on health in LMICs. Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria: 23 focusing on electrification and 10 focusing on electricity reliability. Using a modified socio-ecological model, 4 main levels of influence were identified: (1) individual, (2) household, (3) community, and (4) institutional. Electrification was generally associated with positive health outcomes, such as reduced mortality, lower rates of disease, and improved quality of and access to care, while poor electricity reliability was associated with negative health outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality, lower quality of care, and reduced utilisation of health services. Although the overall quality of the evidence was weak, given the many potential pathways through which electricity may affect health, efforts should be made not only to increase the number of connected households globally, but to improve the reliability of the electricity supply as well.

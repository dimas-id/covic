Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is defined as the spontaneous development of itchy hives and/or angioedema due to known or unknown causes that last for at least 6 weeks. At any given time, CSU is believed to affect 0.5-1% of the global population. Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody) is the only approved treatment for antihistamine refractory CSU. However, ~ 30% of patients remain symptomatic at licensed doses of omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, even after a treatment period of over 6 months. In the recent years, there have been several studies on updosing of the drug, suggesting that the individualized approach for urticaria treatment with omalizumab is useful. In this article, we provide an overview of these studies and the real-world data on omalizumab updosing as it became necessary to obtain complete CSU symptom control in a proportion of patients. Published observational studies (from June 2003 to October 2019) on the updosing of omalizumab in CSU were identified using PubMed and Ovid databases. Reports mainly show that updosing/dose adjustment evaluated with the assessment of disease activity (Urticaria Activity Score) and control (Urticaria Control Test) achieves better clinical response to omalizumab with a good safety profile in a pool of patients with CSU. These real-world data will provide an overview of updosing of omalizumab in CSU and aid in setting informed clinical practice treatment expectations.

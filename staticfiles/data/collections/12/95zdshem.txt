PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Abdominal ultrasound plays a vital role in the diagnostic work-up of many cats presenting to general and specialist practitioners. Ultrasound examination of the kidneys and perinephric space can provide important information on several conditions including chronic renal disease, hydronephrosis and perinephric pseudocyst formation. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Despite ultrasonography being a commonly used modality, many practitioners are not comfortable performing an ultrasound examination or interpreting the resulting images. Even for the experienced ultrasonographer, differentiating between incidental findings, such as a medullary rim sign, and pathological changes can be challenging. AIM This review, part of an occasional series on feline abdominal ultrasonography, discusses ultrasonographic examination of the normal and diseased kidney and perinephric space. Aimed at general practitioners who wish to improve their knowledge of and confidence in feline abdominal ultrasound, this review is accompanied by high-resolution images and videos available online as supplementary material. A subsequent article will address ultrasonography of the collecting system including the renal pelvis and urinary bladder. EQUIPMENT Ultrasound facilities are readily available to most practitioners, although use of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool is highly dependent on operator experience. EVIDENCE BASE Information provided in this article is drawn from the published literature and the author's own clinical experience.

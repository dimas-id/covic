The influence of riboflavin (B2)-overproducing lactobacilli on the antioxidant status, isoflavone conversion, off-flavor reduction, amino acid profile, and viscosity of B2-bio-enriched fermented soymilk was investigated. Results showed that B2 in fermented soymilk was notably increased from 0.2 to 3.8 µg/mL for Lactobacillus fermentum UFG169 and to 1.9 µg/mL for Lactobacillus plantarum UFG10. The apparent viscosity significantly changed with rising acidity and agglutination of protein. The off-flavor volatile substances (hexanal and nonanal) were significantly reduced in fermented soymilk. Furthermore, a large amount of glucoside form isoflavones was deglycosylated into bioactive aglycones after 4 h up to 32 h. B2 content and isoflavones significantly improved the antioxidant status of soymilk. Partial least squares regression analysis correlated the strain activity and fermentation time with the improved nutritional and functional soymilk qualities. This study demonstrated the strategy for strain development for B2-bio-enriched fermentation to extend the health-promoting benefits of soymilk and soy-related foods. KEY POINTS: â¢ B 2 -enriched fermentation enhanced the nutrition and functional status of soymilk. â¢ Fermentation time significantly affected the apparent viscosity of fermented soymilk. â¢ Off-flavor volatile substances were significantly reduced or even diminished. â¢ Increased B 2 and bioactive isoflavones contributed to improved antioxidant potential.

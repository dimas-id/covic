The objective of this study was to evaluate regional oxygen saturation of the brain during immediate transition after birth, and to correlate it with pre-ductal arterial oxygen saturation in newborn infants. The prospective observational study including newborn infants in the first 15 min after spontaneous vaginal delivery and uncomplicated transitional period was undertaken. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)brain) was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) were measured on the right wrist by pulse oximetry. rSO(2)brain, SpO(2) and HR measurements were started immediately after birth and were performed in the first 15 min of life. Cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) was calculated for each minute. Of 145 newborn infants, 16 were included and the gender allocation was 31 females (49.2%) and 32 males (50.8%). rSO(2)brain increased rapidly from 39% (2 min) to 69% (5 min), SpO(2) increased from 72% (2 min) to 96% (14 min) and FTOE showed a significant decrease from minute 2 (0.47) until minute 4 (0.30) and an increase between 8 to 13 min. rSO(2)brain increased rapidly after vaginal delivery. Although SpO(2) increased within the first 14 min after delivery, rSO(2)brain showed no further significant changes after 5 min. FTOE decreased in the first 4 min and reached standard values subsequently.

Abstract Ethnophamacological relevance The Chinese herbal prescription JieZe-1 (JZ-1) is based on the modification of Yihuang Tang, which was first described in Fu Qingzhu Nvke by the famous Qing Dynasty doctor Shan Fu as a treatment for leukorrheal diseases. As an in-hospital preparation, JZ-1 has been used in Tongji Hospital for many years to treat various infectious diseases of the lower female genital tract, including cervicitis, vaginitis, genital herpes and condyloma acuminatum. Our previous studies have shown that JZ-1 has curative effects on Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections. Aim of the study Genital herpes is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and is mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). Current therapies can relieve symptoms in patients but do not cure or prevent the spread of the virus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection and its mechanism, which is based on autophagy induction, to provide new ideas and a basis for the study of antiviral drugs. Materials and methods Evaluation of the antiviral activity of JZ-1 was conducted by MTT assay and western blotting. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, observations through transmission electron microscopy and experiments with the recombinant lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B were used to monitor autophagic flux in VK2/E6E7 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JZ-1 regulates autophagy, western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and to detect changes in critical molecules in the pathway after the application of a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β and TNF-α, were measured with qRT-PCR. Results HSV-2 infection inhibited autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells. Further study revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by HSV-2 infection may result in the blocked autophagic flux and inhibited autophagosome and autolysosome formation. JZ-1 exhibited significant antiviral activity in the VK2/E6E7 cells, which showed increased cell vitality and reduced viral protein expression, namely, earliest virus-specific infected cell polypeptides 5 (ICP5) and glycoprotein D (gD). We found that JZ-1 treatment inhibited the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and promoted autophagy to combat HSV-2 infection, while PI3K inhibitor pretreatment prevented the enhanced autophagy induced by JZ-1. Moreover, JZ-1 attenuated the increase in inflammatory cytokines that had been induced HSV-2 infection. Conclusion Our results showed that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 infection, and this beneficial effect may be mediated by inducing autophagy via inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis.

In this article, we introduce an infinite-dimensional deterministic SIS model which takes into account the heterogeneity of the infections and the social network among a large population. We study the long-time behavior of the dynamic. We identify the basic reproduction number $R_0$ which determines whether there exists a stable endemic steady state (super-critical case: $R_0>1$) or if the only equilibrium is disease-free (critical and sub-critical case: $R_0\leq1$). As an application of this general study, we prove that the so-called ``leaky'' and ``all-or-nothing'' vaccination mechanism have the same effect on $R_0$. This framework is also very natural and intuitive to model lockdown policies and study their impact.

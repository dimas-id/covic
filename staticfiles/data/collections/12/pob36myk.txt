The potential immune intersection between COVID-19 disease and cancer therapy raises important practical clinical questions and highlights multiple scientific gaps to be filled. Among available therapeutic approaches to consider, checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) seem to require major attention as they may act at the cross-road between cancer treatment and COVID-19 disease, due to their profound immunomodulatory activity. Based on available literature evidences, we suggest guidance to consider for treating physicians, and propose areas of clinical and pre-clinical investigation. Comprehensively, though with the necessary caution, ICI therapy seems to remain a suitable therapeutic option for cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

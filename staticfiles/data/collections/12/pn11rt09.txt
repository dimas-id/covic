Background Preventative measures are necessary to control a pandemic such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and different platforms to communicate guidelines have varying levels of effectiveness. Objective At the time of this study, there were no published studies investigating knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to COVID-19 within the Saudi population. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap in current knowledge and provide baseline data to the government and other health associations for preventive measurements for future outbreaks. Methods This study was conducted among the Saudi population using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed the awareness of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) incubation period, the known symptoms of COVID-19, the mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and infection control measures for prevention. Results The study included 6000 participants. Most respondents (84.93%) of the population reported awareness of the virus, 78.78% reported a belief that the virus leads to death, 89.47% reported a belief that 14 days is the incubation period, and 93.73% were aware of the possibility of asymptomatic carriers. Conclusions The Saudi population is aware of the attitudes and practices of prevention as well as the mode of transmission. The efforts by the Ministry of Health were effective in increasing awareness among the Saudi population toward COVID-19.

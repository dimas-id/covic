Complications of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are responsible for a relevant proportion of the mortality. Most importantly, acute exacerbation leads to an in-hospital mortality of more than 50% with a mean survival time of only a few months. Therefore, consideration of complications in IPF is of great importance for understanding the disease and treatment planning. Furthermore, the evidence for pneumological rehabilitation in IPF has greatly increased. This resulted in specific recommendations by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) for improvement in physical capacity, quality of life and symptom control.

OBJECTIVE To test the tensile properties of knotted suture made of 4 different suture materials and exposed to petroleum gauze. STUDY DESIGN We tested the tensile strength of United States Pharmacopeia size 0-0 gauge polydioxanone, polyglyconate, glycolide/lactide copolymer, and silk when exposed to petroleum packing or saline. Suture materials were randomized, and knots were tied and then evaluated via tensiometer to the point of knot failure. RESULTS A total of 285 knots were tied in 8 groups based on material and exposure to saline or petroleum gauze. We found that petroleum exposure knots failed at a mean of 116.7 N (SD = 31.5) and that saline soaked knots failed at 123.8 N (SD = 32.0). We conducted a 4 Ã— 2 factorial analysis of variance, finding knots exposed to petroleum failed at a statistically significantly lower tensile strengths than saline soaked knots (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Petroleum-exposed sutures fail at lower tensions than saline-exposed sutures.

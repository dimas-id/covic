OBJECTIVE To report the feasibility of laparoendoscopic single port surgical approach for the management of huge adnexal cysts and adnexal torsion during pregnancy. To discuss the optimal method of entry into the peritoneal cavity for pregnant patients. DESIGN Two case report. METHOD AND PATIENT(S): Two pregnant patients with adnexal mass. First patient, suffering from persistent and progressive abdominal distention and pain on her 12th week of pregnancy, was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst in 18 cm diameter on left ovary. The other patient had IVF twin pregnancy and presented with left adnexal torsion on the 25th week of pregnancy. INTERVENTION(S) Single-port laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy on the 12th week of pregnancy in patient one and single-port left adnexectomy in a twin pregnancy on the 25th week of pregnancy in patient two. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Feasibility of single port laparoscopic intervention during pregnancy for adnexal mass. RESULT(S) Complete resolution of the symptoms for both pregnant women after the surgeries. No fetal and maternal complication was diagnosed during both pregnancies. CONCLUSION(S) Single port laparoscopy with open-entry technique is feasible and might be a better surgical option for the pregnant patients with adnexal pathology. However, further studies with larger sample size are needed to reach clear conclusion.

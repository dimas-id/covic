The aims of this study were to investigate the human bocavirus (HBoV) frequency and genotypes in hospitalized children <5 years presenting acute respiratory infections (ARI) within the São Paulo metropolitan area. Nasopharyngeal samples from 300 patients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were tested by qPCR for the NSP1 and NP-1 genes. The VP1/2 gene in positive samples was then amplified by PCR and sequenced. A total of 49 positive HBoV cases (16.3%; mean Ct value of 34.41) were detected with the mean age being 18.1 months (range 1 month to 5 years) and the median age being 1 year of age. Children aged between 0 and 12 months had higher detection rates of HBoV (69.4%; 34/49; mean Ct = 34.45) than children from other age groups (30.6%; 15/49; mean Ct = 34.34). No significant differences were observed between HBoV Ct levels and clinical illness. The occurrence was more frequently associated with fall (38.8%; 19/49) and spring (36.7%; 18/49). All 12 sequenced isolates were identified as HBoV-1, displaying minor genetic variation compared to the Swedish reference strains ST1 and ST2 (99.1–99.7% nt). The sole identification of HBoV-1 supports the hypothesis that this particular genotype is strongly related to ARI, and contributes to the role of this virus in the aetiology of respiratory diseases.

Dental disease can have a profound effect on the comfort and well-being of pets. Oral disease can be difficult to detect. Patients often hide their discomfort. The identification and treatment or removal of diseased teeth are the responsibility of the veterinarian. When diseased teeth cannot be saved by specialized care, extraction of teeth is necessary. Proper extraction of teeth in dogs and cats can be challenging and frustrating, but with review of the oral anatomy, proper instrumentation, and gentle tissue-handling techniques, this can be a rewarding part of clinical practice.

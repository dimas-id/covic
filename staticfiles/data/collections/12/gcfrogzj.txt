INTRODUCTION Based on current guidelines, many women qualify for postnatal thromboprophylaxis following childbirth, however, little information exists on how adherent women are and their experiences to both pharmacological and mechanical forms of thromboprophylaxis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Women requiring postnatal thromboprophylaxis were given questionnaire packs exploring their beliefs about enoxaparin, anti-embolic stockings (AES) and intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCD). Women were also asked to complete a diary recording when doses of enoxaparin were injected, along with an estimation of the number of hours the AES were worn each day, if at all. Results were entered onto SPSS and analysed. RESULTS Sixty-seven women completed the questionnaire packs. Adherence to enoxaparin therapy was relatively high (82.4%). Women self-reported sub-optimal adherence levels to the AES, with 24% stating they never wore them once home. Reasons for this included being mobile, feeling hot and feeling as if they were cutting circulation off in the legs. Women reported a high level of acceptance of IPCD post caesarean section and would be happy for IPCD to be applied again in future deliveries, if required. CONCLUSIONS Although many women are adherent to postnatal TP, our findings suggest that adherence to AES is sub-optimal following discharge from hospital and therefore their usefulness is questionable. Front-line clinical staff should discuss the importance of adherence to postnatal TP, in order to avert preventable venous thromboembolic events.

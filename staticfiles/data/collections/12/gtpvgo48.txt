The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still progressing and has been recorded in more than 210 countries and territories worldwide. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first cases of COVID-19 were detected on 5th of March 2020 in the entity of Republic of Srpska and 9th of March 2020 in the entity of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Up until the 16th of May 2020, more than 2,200 COVID-19 cases were recorded in both entities, with a mortality rate of 5.8% (131 out of 2231 cases). The aim of this ongoing study is to present the current epidemiological and sociodemographic parameters of 380 COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (UCH Mostar) during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 380 patients, 60 (15.8%) of them required hospitalization. The mortality rate was 5% (19/380). The highest mortality rate of 15.2% (12/79) was recorded in the patients age &#8805;65 years. In addition to this single-centre experience of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the epidemiological measures imposed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with emphasis on the restrictive ones.

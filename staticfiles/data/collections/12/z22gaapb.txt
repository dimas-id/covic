Decontamination of N95 respirators has become critical to alleviate PPE shortages for healthcare workers in the current COVID-19 emergency. The factors that are considered for the effective reuse of these masks are the fit, filter efficiency and decontamination/disinfection level both for SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative virus for COVID-19, and for other organisms of concern in the hospital environment such as Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile. In its guidance entitled 'Recommendations for Sponsors Requesting EUAs for Decontamination and Bioburden Reduction Systems for Surgical Masks and Respirators During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) Public Health Emergency' (May 2020)[1], the FDA recommends a 6-log10 reduction in either the most resistant bacterial spores for the system or in a mycobacterium species to authorize the use of a decontamination method of N95 respirators for single or multiple users. While the goal is primarily inactivation against SARS-CoV-2, testing of decontamination methods against the virus may not always be available. For decontamination methods considered for only single users, the recommendation is a 6-log10 reduction in the infective virus concentration of 3 non-enveloped viruses or in the concentration of two Gram (+) and two Gram (-) bacteria. Based on these recommendations, we explored the efficacy of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) treatment of N95 respirators against surrogate viruses covering a wide range of disinfection resistance for emergency decontamination and reuse to alleviate PPE shortages for healthcare workers in the COVID-19 emergency.

Coronaviruses have been isolated from cases of neonatal calf diarrhoea in many parts of the world and were revealed in the respiratory tract recently, during a study of calf pneumonia. In experiments on gnotobiotic calves an enteric coronavirus replicated in the nasal epithelium and a respiratory isolate was shed in faeces. The enteric coronavirus prevented subsequent infection with either homologous enteric or the respiratory isolate. A dual tropism for this agent was emphasized by the detection of coronavirus antigen in intestinal and respiratory epithelium of naturally-infected calves.

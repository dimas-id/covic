Olfactory disorders are common in “nasal inflammation” even though the term is comprehensive and subsumes different kinds of entities which have to be differentiated. The most common cause of olfactory disorders are sinonasal disorders, which are defined as secondary smell disorders caused by diseases/pathologies in the nose/paranasal sinuses. According to the literature, sinonasal disorders represent—depending on the examined population—up to 72% of all olfactory disorders. In general, noninflammatory and inflammatory disorders are differentiated. Inflammatory disorders can be further classified into infectious or noninfectious disorders, both forms in which olfactory disorders can be present. For the clinician examining patients, the exact classification of the olfactory disorder is mandatory in order to choose appropriate treatment and counseling. Among the most common inflammatory disorders are acute rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, post‐upper respiratory tract infection and chronic rhinosinusitis, which are discussed in detail. In contrast to nasal inflammation, only little is known about oral inflammation and its psychophysical effects on taste function. Taste disorders following oral inflammation are briefly discussed.

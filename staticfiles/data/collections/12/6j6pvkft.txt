OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to present information on respiratory inhibition after crying (RIAC), feeding hypoxemia, and respiratory inhibition after gastroesophageal reflux (RIGER) to medical staff caring for infants. METHODS The author reviewed investigations of these conditions. RESULTS These conditions have been observed in full-term healthy infants, and they are accompanied clinically by central cyanosis and a decrease in SpO2 to less than 70%. These conditions are easily diagnosed using pulse oximetry. Among Japanese infants with a gestational age of 36 weeks or older, the incidence of RIAC and feeding hypoxemia is 24% and 32%, respectively. The incidence of RIGER is approximately 4%. Feeding hypoxemia occurs significantly more often during bottle-feeding than during breastfeeding. RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and RIGER are significantly associated with each other. The risk factors are maternal smoking during pregnancy, threatened premature labor, twin gestation, asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction, and abnormal cranial ultrasound findings. Almost all infants recover from RIAC by day 7 after birth. Some infants with feeding hypoxemia require additional assistance and monitoring by nursing staff until the day of discharge. CONCLUSIONS Medical staff caring for infants should note the presence of RIAC, feeding hypoxemia, and RIGER.

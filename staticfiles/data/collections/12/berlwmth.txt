Patients with COVID‐19 are sometimes already being treated for one or more other chronic conditions, especially if they are elderly. Introducing a treatment against COVID‐19, either on an outpatient basis or during hospitalization for more severe cases, raises the question of potential drug‐drug interactions. Here, we analyzed the potential or proven risk of the co‐administration of drugs used for the most common chronic diseases and those currently offered as treatment or undergoing therapeutic trials for COVID‐19. Practical recommendations are offered, where possible.

OBJECTIVES To report on our initial experience with single-incision multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy, together with its clinical outcomes. DESIGN Nonrandomized prospective study. SETTING University department of surgery. PATIENTS Sixty-four patients with gallstones and gallbladder polyps were enrolled after providing informed consent. Based on our experience, we excluded patients with acute cholecystitis, concomitant choledocholithiasis, a history of previous upper abdominal surgery, and a suspicion of gallbladder cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We analyzed the outcomes and complications, based on our experience, according to the clinicopathologic and operative factors. We also compared patients who underwent single-incision multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy with those who were converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. RESULTS There were 2 bile duct injuries and 4 surgical site infections. We had difficulties in visualizing the Calot triangle in 22 patients. Higher levels of inflammatory markers, longer operation times, and more frequent bile juice spillage were significantly observed in those patients. Ten patients were converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The mean age of patients who underwent conversion surgery was significantly older than that of the no-conversion group. The more the body mass index increased, the more the conversion rate increased. CONCLUSIONS Experienced laparoscopic surgeons can safely perform cholecystectomy using conventional and curved laparoscopic instruments in selected patients. We recommend that you consider performing conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy or that you use additional retraction devices for patients with a higher body mass index or acute cholecystitis.

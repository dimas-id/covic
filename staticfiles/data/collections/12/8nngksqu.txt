Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second most common cause of death in women. Estrogen plays an important role in breast tumor etiopathogenesis. Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs are used in breast cancer patients who have a positive estrogen receptor (ER). While angiotensin II plays a key role in breast cancer etiology and causes tamoxifen resistance, angiotensin 1–7 has been reported to may reduce the spread and invasion of breast cancer. During the COVID-19 infection, the virus blocks ACE2, and angiotensin 1–7 production discontinued. Angiotensin III production may increase as angiotensin II destruction is reduced. Thus, aminopeptidase upregulation may occur. Increased aminopeptidase may develop resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Estrogen can have a protective effect against COVID-19. Estrogen increase causes ER-α upregulation in T lymphocytes. Thus, estrogen increases the release of interferon I and III from T lymphocytes. Increasing interferon I and III alleviates COVID-19 infection. Tamoxifen treatment causes down-regulation, mutation, or loss in estrogen receptors. In the long-term use of tamoxifen, its effects on estrogen receptors can be permanent. Thus, since estrogen receptors are damaged or downregulated, estrogen may not act by binding to these receptors. Tamoxifen is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, independent of its effect on estrogen receptors. It suppresses T cell functions and interferon release. We think tamoxifen may increase the COVID-19 risk due to its antiestrogen and P-glycoprotein inhibitory effects.

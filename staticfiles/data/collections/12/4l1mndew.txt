Leiomyomas are benign lesions arising from the smooth muscle layer. They are most commonly detected either within the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Primary hepatic leiomyoma (PHL) is a rare pathology. It is an isolated pathology within the liver, without evidence of any other coexisting leiomyomas. Very few cases have been described in literature. PHL may occur in healthy individuals although an association with immunodeficiency and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been observed. Majority of the reported cases have been in females. A 20-year-old female patient presented with abdominal symptoms. MRI confirmed an 8 cm mass, with very low signal intensity on T2 images and peripheral rim enhancement on gadolinium. A laparoscopic left lateral sectorectomy was performed. Final histopathology confirmed the presence of benign lesion with spindle cell and smooth muscle proliferation and a fibro-vascular stroma compatible with a leiomyoma. There was no evidence of any leiomyomatous lesion elsewhere in the body. A rare diagnosis of PHL was therefore established. Acknowledging the rare incidence of this lesion, we report the same and review the relevant literature. PHL is usually a retrospective diagnosis, confirmed on histo-pathology assessment of the resected specimen. Liver resection is required in these patients due to the presence of symptoms, in the presence of a solid mass lesion within the liver. Surgery is thus definitive, diagnostic cum therapeutic.

Abstract Objective: Concern about getting sick could help prevent disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of a COVID-19 concern scale (EPCov-19). Materials and methods: This is an instrument-based study and information was collected from 224 people of Peruvian nationality in the context of social isolation. The items of the Cancer Concern Scale (CCS) were adapted for this study. Results: A scale with satisfactory psychometric properties was obtained. With a matrix of polychoric correlations, values higher than the standard were obtained in all 6 items (r > 0.3) and the reliability was acceptable (Î± = 0.866; 95% CI = 0.83 - 0.89). Parallel analysis suggested unidimensionality of the EPCov-19, the variance explained was 79.7% and saturations were higher than 0.4. Goodness-of-fit indices were satisfactory (CFI=0.995; GFI = 0.997; TLI = 0.991; and RMSEA = 0.059, 95% CI = 0.012 - 0.077). Conclusions: This is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring concern about the spread of COVID-19 and can be used in future studies.

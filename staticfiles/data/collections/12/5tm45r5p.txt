Abstract: Diagnosis of sepsis is based on recognition of systemic inflammation and organ failure in the context of an inciting infection. Since none of the diagnostic criteria are specific to sepsis, it is easy to confound sepsis with noninfectious causes of systemic inflammation, including pancreatitis, cardiac ischemia, bowel perforation, vasculitis, and pulmonary embolism amongst others. Two widely used biomarkers, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, have proven promising in sepsis diagnosis. Each has found varying success in the clinical context, with some centers relying heavily on these markers and others eschewing their use almost entirely. In this chapter, we present the evidence for their use in the diagnosis of sepsis and management of antibiotic therapy in the intensive care unit context.

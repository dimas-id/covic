Drawing on the social interdependence theory, we experimentally compared the between-group effects of social learning gamification, competition gamification, and non-gamification on the academic performance in the within-group socio-cognitive conflict learning. Findings show that the positive learning effects of socio-cognitive conflict in within-group are strengthened when the between-group gamification is designed by social learning or competitive strategy.

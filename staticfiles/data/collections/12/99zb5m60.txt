In this chapter we discuss the factors that contribute to the unique immunological environment of the central nervous system and the mechanisms that may account for the development of autoimmunity within the CNS, including infectious agents as inducers of autoimmune disease. Consideration is given to a variety of human neurological diseases of autoimmune or presumed autoimmune etiology: autism, neuromyelitis optica, neuromyotonia, schizophrenia, lethargic encephalitis and stiff‐man syndrome. Also, we discuss autoimmunity as a possible mediator of CNS repair and examples of the protective effects of bacterial and helminth infections on CNS disease. Multiple sclerosis and models of multiple sclerosis are discussed with special attention given to the Theiler's virus‐induced demyelination model.

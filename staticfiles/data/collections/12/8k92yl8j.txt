OBJECTIVE To compare 4 techniques for pelvic flexure enterotomy closure in horses. STUDY DESIGN Ex-vivo study. SAMPLE POPULATION Cadaveric ascending colon specimens (n = 48 horses). METHODS Pelvic flexure enterotomies of different lengths (5 cm, 10 cm) were performed and closed with 1 of 4 techniques: handsewn 2 layer (HS2); handsewn 1 layer (HS1); skin staples (SKS); or TA90 stapling device (TA90). Time to close each enterotomy, bursting pressure, luminal reduction, and cost were calculated and compared. RESULTS HS2 was significantly more time consuming to perform in the 5 cm group whereas in the 10 cm group, only the HS1 and SKS were faster than the other techniques. Luminal reduction was not different between techniques in either group. HS2 resulted in consistently higher bursting pressure compared with SKS and TA90 in the 5 cm group and compared to all other techniques in the 10 cm group. CONCLUSION The TA90 technique had the lowest bursting pressure and highest cost. The HS2 technique was strongest.

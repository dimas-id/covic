The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious viral disease that predominantly causes respiratory symptoms. Elevated liver enzymes have been reported during the course of disease and appear to be common. We present a 56-year-old woman with a history of decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with abdominal pain, fever and diarrhoea and was found to have acute on chronic liver failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient was treated with empiric antibiotic and supportive care with subsequent improvement.

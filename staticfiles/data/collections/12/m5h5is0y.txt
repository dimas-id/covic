Background The reemergence of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections in the United States was reported from August-October 2014 (691 cases). In Mexico, an outbreak at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases was reported (24 cases). The results of epidemiological surveillance of Enterovirus sp. (EV) and other respiratory viruses in a national pediatric tertiary care level hospital are presented. Methods Following the alert issued by the reemergence of EV-D68 in 2014, epidemiological surveillance -which only detected respiratory viruses by PCR in patients with influenza-like illness using nasopharyngeal swabs- expanded to include children with asthma exacerbation or acute respiratory distress. Positive samples to EV were confirmed and typed by sequencing. Subsequent sequencing was used to obtain the complete viral genome. Results Of 1705 samples, 13 were positive to EV. Patients with EV presented the following comorbidities: chronic lung disease (7.7%), neoplastic disease (15.4%), allergic asthma/rhinitis (23%), recurrent pneumonia (23%), and other (23%). Of the 13 samples positive for EV, three were positive for EV-D68. These cases required invasive mechanical ventilation, presented no neurological involvement and survived. Conclusions The impact of the population studied by EV-D68 was lower than that reported in Mexico during the same period. Cases of EV-D68 infection had multiple comorbidities, but few pulmonary comorbidities, which could explain the low attack rate. The epidemiological surveillance and infection prevention system may have contained the outbreak.

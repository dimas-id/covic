Dendritic cells (DCs), including Langerhans Cells (LCs), are probably among the earliest targets of HIV infection. Their localization in mucosal epithelia and in the T cell areas of lymphoid organs, as well as their crucial role in capturing antigens and initiating T cell responses, highlight their potential importance. Studies with cells in culture have addressed different outcomes of the HIV-â€“DC interaction, which include: direct productive infection of DC; carriage of virus by DC to CD4+ T cells; transfer of virus between DC and T cells at an infectious synapse; and immune evasion strategies of infected DC. Here we review the literature covering these areas, including current knowledge of underlying mechanisms or pathways.

COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic that has already reached over 2 million confirmed cases globally, with at least 140,000 deaths as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) as of April 16, 2020 1 . More than 662,000 cases have been reported in the United States with more than 29,000 deaths2 . The overall crude mortality rate now stands at 6.6% (may possibly be lower due to under-testing and under-reporting of total confirmed cases), and is highly dependent on age group, comorbidities, and the locoregional resources medically1 . A report from the United States presented age-stratified COVID-19 associated hospitalization rates among 1,482 patients during March 1-28, 2020, highlighting an alarmingly high rate of 74.5% at age > 50 years with underlining medical conditions3 . Based on a data summary report provided by New York City Health, as of April 14, 2020, the shares of a total of 6839 deaths reached 0.04%, 4.5%, 23.1%, 24.6%, and 47.7% for the age groups of 0-17, 18-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+ years old4 . All data suggest that adults at a more advanced age group are facing higher morbidity and mortality risks.

Abstract Three groups of investigators came together to learn from each other in a workshop: neurologists and neuropathologists interested in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinative diseases of man and similar autoimmune and virus-induced model diseases in animals; immunologists and virologists concerned with the genetic controls found to play a role in these diseases; and geneticists and molecular biologists investigating specific gene products and their role in recognition function and cell interactions in model immunological systems.

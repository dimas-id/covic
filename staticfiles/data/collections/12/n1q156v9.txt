Poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) of turkeys and runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) of chickens are significant viral enteric diseases of poultry. Although a number of different viruses, including avian reoviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses and coronaviruses, have been isolated from the intestinal contents of birds in affected poultry flocks, their role in PEMS and RSS is not yet understood. Here, we report the application of a molecular screening method to detection of novel viruses in intestinal samples of chickens and turkeys exhibiting characteristic signs of enteric disease. The technique is based on random amplification of particle-associated nucleic acids in clinical samples. Using this method we successfully identified parvovirus DNA sequences in intestinal homogenates of affected birds. This is the first time partial genomic sequences of autonomously replicating chicken and turkey parvoviruses have been described. Sequence analysis of the left end of the genome, including the complete non-structural gene, demonstrated that the chicken and turkey parvoviruses were closely related to each other and were representative of a novel member of the Parvovirus family. These parvoviruses may play a significant role in the aetiology of PEMS and RSS.

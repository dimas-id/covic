BACKGROUND All junior physicians in Taiwan were enrolled into a 3-month post-graduate year 1 (PGY1) course after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) attack in 2003. AIMS To develop and evaluate a new airway management training protocol by using an integrated course of lectures, technical workshops and medical simulations. METHODS In each PGY1 course, the trainees participated in the Advanced Airway Life Support (AALS) program. After 2 h lecture, the trainees were divided into three groups for 4 h technical workshop, including 10 skill stations and medical simulation at the Clinical Skills Resources Center of the hospital at different times. Video-based debriefing and feedback were performed after each simulation. The same scenario was re-simulated after debriefing. Participants' performance was assessed by single global rating and a 5 key actions scoring. RESULTS A total of 266 junior physicians have been trained with this AALS programs in 2 years. They learned the techniques of airway management, passed the performance checklist of technical workshop, and received higher scores during re-simulation regardless of scoring methods. CONCLUSIONS The AALS training program can provide methodical and systematic training for junior residents to mature with specialized technical skills and higher-order cognitive skills, behaviors and leadership in airway management.

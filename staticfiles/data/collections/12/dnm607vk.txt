Magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents have been widely used over the last 3 decades in routine clinical practice. Paul Lauterbur recognized the presence of these contrast agents, which act as paramagnetic catalysts that accelerate the T1 relaxation process. The first MR contrast agent to be approved for clinical use was in 1988, and since then, it is estimated that 200 million doses have been administered worldwide. These contrast agents have diverse clinical as well as research applications, involving almost all the body organs. This review will cover some existing as well as many new applications that have emerged over the last few decades. MR imaging now has the potential of being used to monitor enzymatic activity, gene expression, metal ion homeostasis, and cell death in vivo. In future, newer contrast agents will develop and become commercially available, expanding the current clinical applications of MR contrast media.

CASE DESCRIPTION A 4-year-old 29-kg (63.8-lb) spayed female Husky crossbred was referred for emergency treatment because of catastrophic hemorrhagic shock following attempts at cystocentesis for investigation of suspected urinary tract infection. CLINICAL FINDINGS On arrival at the hospital, clinicopathologic assessments revealed rapidly decreasing PCV and worsening hypoproteinemia, compared with findings immediately prior to referral. The dog had severe hyperlactemia. Ultrasonography revealed the presence of free fluid in the abdomen; the fluid appeared to be blood (determined via abdominocentesis). TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Urgent surgical exploration was undertaken. Two small lacerations in the ventral aspect of the abdominal aorta just dorsal to the bladder were identified and repaired. Multiple transfusions of packed RBCs (5 units) and fresh frozen plasma (3 units) were administered, and autotransfusion of blood (1.2 L) from the abdomen was performed. The dog recovered well from surgery and anesthesia, but developed signs of severe pain and swelling of both hind limbs, which were attributed to reperfusion injury following aortic occlusion during surgery. Treatment included administration of S-adenosylmethionine (23 mg/kg [10.5 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h) and analgesia; 5 days after surgery, the hind limb problems had resolved and treatments were discontinued. CLINICAL RELEVANCE In the dog of this report, aortic laceration secondary to cystocentesis was successfully treated with a combination of surgery and massive transfusion; the development of reperfusion injury was an interesting and reversible complication of surgery. The possibility of damage to intra-abdominal structures should be investigated if a dog becomes acutely ill after cystocentesis.

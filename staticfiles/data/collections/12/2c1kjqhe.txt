This report describes a case of Rhodococcus equi infection causing pyogranulomatous skin disease and cellulitis in a two‐year‐old female domestic shorthaired cat. The case differed from previously reported cases in cats in its clinical presentation and in the locations of the lesions, which were similar to those seen in horses. The presence of an intracellular organism was confirmed by cytology and on histopathology. The aetiological diagnosis was confirmed by routine biochemical tests specific for R equi on a pure isolate obtained from a biopsy specimen. The report also reviews the literature of the documented feline cases and discusses the common pitfalls in the diagnosis of such infections.

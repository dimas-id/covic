There has been a significant surge in admissions to critical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, the demands on blood components have not been described. We reviewed their use during the first 6 weeks of the outbreak from 3rd March 2020 in a tertiary-level critical care department providing veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO). 265 patients were reviewed - 235 not requiring ECMO and 30 requiring vv-ECMO. In total, 50 patients required blood components during their critical care admission. Red cell concentrates were the most frequently transfused component in COVID-19 infected patients with higher rates of use during vv-ECMO. The use of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions was low in a period prior to the use of convalescent plasma.

BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) methods have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, they are costly. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has emerged as a novel alternative isothermal amplification method for the detection of nucleic acid. METHODS: A rapid, sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection. RESULTS: This assay detected one copy/reaction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 30 min. Both the clinical sensitivity and specificity of this assay were 100%. The RT-LAMP showed comparable performance with RT-qPCR. Combining simplicity and cost-effectiveness, this assay is therefore recommended for use in resource resource-limited settings.

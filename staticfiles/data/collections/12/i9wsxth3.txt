Abstract The development of a rapid, specific, and sensitive SYBR Green I-based duplex real-time quantitative PCR assay is described for the simultaneous detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3). The assay specifically detected PEDV and PCV3, with no fluorescence detected for other non-targeted pig pathogens. The assay showed a good linear relationship, and the limits of detection for this assay were 34.6 copies/μL and 61.2 copies/μL for PEDV and PCV3, respectively. The assay exhibited high repeatability and reproducibility, with intra-assay and inter-assay variation coefficients less than 2.0%. A clinical evaluation using intestinal tissue and fecal samples from piglets suffering from diarrhea at different pig farms in China revealed that the singular infection rates of PEDV and PCV3 were 43.94% (29/66) and 16.67% (11/66), respectively, while the co-infection rate of PCV3 with PEDV was 27.27% (18/66). The results indicate this assay is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool for PEDV and PCV3 monitoring and surveillance in the field, and provides technical support for the quantitative detection of clinical samples infected or co-infected with PEDV and PCV3.

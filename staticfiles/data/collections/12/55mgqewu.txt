Critical-size bone defects, which require large-volume tissue reconstruction, remain a clinical challenge. Bone engineering has the potential to provide new treatment concepts, yet clinical translation requires anatomically and physiologically relevant preclinical models. The ovine critical-size long-bone defect model has been validated in numerous studies as a preclinical tool for evaluating both conventional and novel bone-engineering concepts. With sufficient training and experience in large-animal studies, it is a technically feasible procedure with a high level of reproducibility when appropriate preoperative and postoperative management protocols are followed. The model can be established by following a procedure that includes the following stages: (i) preoperative planning and preparation, (ii) the surgical approach, (iii) postoperative management, and (iv) postmortem analysis. Using this model, full results for peer-reviewed publication can be attained within 2 years. In this protocol, we comprehensively describe how to establish proficiency using the preclinical model for the evaluation of a range of bone defect reconstruction options.

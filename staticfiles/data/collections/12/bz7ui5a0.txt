Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) define medical conditions of acute respiratory insufficiency deriving from direct and indirect damage of the alveolar parenchyma and often associated with multiorgan dysfunction (MODS). As a rule, intensive care is based on mechanical ventilation often requiring high doses of sedatives and narcotics. Despite major progress in intensive care medicine the rate of mortality is still very high. Whereas in the past the level of medical progress has been rated based on the mortality rate alone, the many negative somatic and psychological sequelae in long-term-survivors of ARDS are only now being appreciated. From a perspective of C/L psychiatry persisting cognitive dysfunctions, anxiety and mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in their negative impact on health-related quality of life are intensively investigated. In the etiopathogenesis of PTSD associated with ALI/ARDS, many influences have to be discussed, e.g., increases in CO(2) triggering panic affects, a mismatch of norepinephric overstimulation and cortisol insufficiency, negative effects of high doses of benzodiazepines resulting in oversedation, prolonged phases of weaning and more frequent states of delirium. Consolidation and retrieval of traumatic memories of the ICU stay are influenced by complex factors. From a clinical point of view prophylactic stress doses of hydrocortisone may reduce the major risk of PTSD associated with ALI / ARDS.

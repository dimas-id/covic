Visitors may be involved in infection transmission within healthcare settings; however, there is currently limited published data on this subject. This chapter describes situations in which visitor-associated infection transmission occurred and highlights the potential role of visitors in the transmission of pathogenic organisms that can lead to outbreaks in healthcare settings. Infection prevention measures, including isolation precautions and visitor restriction, may be utilized and potentially adapted in order to protect patients and their visitors as well as healthcare personnel. The practical and ethical challenges regarding the use of isolation precautions among visitors to healthcare facilities are discussed.

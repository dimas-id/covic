BACKGROUND The lack of long-term data on quality of life after groin hernia repair presents a challenge in setting patients' postoperative expectations. This study aimed to describe quality of life outcomes after laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair with a minimum of 2 years follow-up. STUDY DESIGN We prospectively evaluated 293 patients who had laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair in an IRB-approved study. The Short-Form 36-item Health Survey (version 2), Surgical Outcomes Measurement System, and Carolinas Comfort Scale were administered pre- and postoperatively. Pairwise comparisons using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test were made between time points. RESULTS Mean patient age was 56 ± 15 years and 93% were male; 80% of patients presented with painful hernias and 15% of hernias were recurrent. Mean operative time was 43 ± 16 minutes. No operative complications occurred. Mean duration of narcotic pain medication use was 2.5 ± 3.4 days, and daily activities were resumed and return to work occurred 5.4 ± 4.4 days and 5.4 ± 3.9 days post operation, respectively. Recurrence rate was 2%. The Short-Form 36-item Health Survey outcomes improved from baseline for domains of Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to Physical Health, and Pain at 2 years post operation; Surgical Outcomes Measurement System outcomes improved for domains of Pain Impact on Quality of Life, Body Image, and Patient Satisfaction (p ≤ 0.05). The percentage of patients reporting no or mild but not bothersome symptoms on the Carolinas Comfort Scale at 2 years post operation for sensation of mesh, pain, and movement limitations were 98%, 95%, and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Measuring both general and procedure-specific quality of life, patients' perceptions of health status improved significantly 2 years after laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair.

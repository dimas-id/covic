There is a natural limit to how IT can generate economic benefits and increase corporate value: It’s IT cost. Many value-oriented IT projects are discontinued, not because the resulting benefits cannot be quantified but because the company’s focus has shifted. And this shift does not necessarily have to include changes in the long-term corporate strategy, as would be caused by external developments in market and competition: To produce less-than-positive effects, all a company needs to do is shift its focus from IT growth drivers to IT-driven cost reductions, as often happens in times of economic downturns or internal restructuring.

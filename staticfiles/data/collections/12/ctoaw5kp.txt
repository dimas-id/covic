PURPOSE The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), overexpressed on various tumor types, is an attractive target for receptor-mediated imaging and therapy. Another interesting approach would be the use of GRPR radioligands for pre-operative imaging and subsequent radio-guided surgery, with the goal to improve surgical outcome. GRPR radioligands were successfully implemented in clinical studies, especially Sarabesin 3 (SB3) is an appealing GRPR antagonist with high receptor affinity. Gallium-68 labeled SB3 has good in vivo stability, after labeling with Indium-111; however, the molecule shows poor in vivo stability, which negatively impacts tumor-targeting capacity. A novel approach to increase in vivo stability of radiopeptides is by co-administration of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (PA). We studied in vivo stability and biodistribution of [111In]SB3 without/with (-/+) PA in mice. Furthermore, SPECT/MRI on a novel, state-of-the-art platform was performed. PROCEDURES GRPR affinity of SB3 was determined on PC295 xenograft sections using [125I]Tyr4-bombesin with tracer only or with increasing concentrations of SB3. For in vivo stability, mice were injected with 200/2000 pmol [111In]SB3 -/+ 300 μg PA. Blood was collected and analyzed. Biodistribution and SPECT/MRI studies were performed at 1, 4, and 24 h postinjection (p.i.) of 2.5 MBq/200 pmol or 25 MBq/200 pmol [111In]SB3 -/+ 300 μg PA in PC-3-xenografted mice. RESULTS SB3 showed high affinity for GRPR (IC50 3.5 nM). Co-administration of PA resulted in twice higher intact peptide in vivo vs [111In]SB3 alone. Biodistribution studies at 1, 4, and 24 h p.i. show higher tumor uptake values with PA co-administration (19.7 ± 3.5 vs 10.2 ± 1.5, 17.6 ± 5.1 vs 8.3 ± 1.1, 6.5 ± 3.3 vs 3.1 ± 1.9 % ID/g tissue (P < 0.0001)). Tumor imaging with SPECT/MRI clearly improved after co-injection of PA. CONCLUSIONS Co-administration of PA increased in vivo tumor targeting capacity of [111In]SB3, making this an attractive combination for GRPR-targeted tumor imaging.

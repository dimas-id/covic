INTRODUCTION ARI occupying the first place in the structure of total human morbidity. The aim of the study was to investigate the species diversity of the viruses causing AR among residents of the Novosibirsk region during epidemic season (October to April). MATERIALS AND METHODS 164 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and analyzed. Viral RNA/DNA, cDNA synthesis and PCR were carried out employing "RIBO-prep" "eReverta-L", "AmpliSens Influenza virus A/B-FL" and "AmpliSens ARI-screen-FL" kits (CRI of Epidemiology). RESULTS Etiological agent of the disease was found in 69(43%) samples. Monoinfection was found in 58 (35%). In 14 (9%) samples were detected serogroup I coronaviruses, in 13 (8%) rhinoviruses, in 7 (4%) respiratory syncytial virus, in 6 (4%) parainfluenza virus type 1, in 5 (3%) parainfluenza virus type 3. Adenoviruses and bocavirus were identified in 3 (2%) samples. Parainfluenza virus type 2 and 4, metapneumovirus, serogroup Il coronaviruses (HKU1 and OC43) were presented in 2 (1%) samples. In 11 (7%) samples was found mixed infection. CONCLUSION The majority of common colds were caused by serogroup I coronaviruses (NL63 and 229E), rhinoviruses and mixed infections. The peak of species variability of viruses caused acute respiratory infections was determined in age group of children 2-4 years old. In older age groups the species variability of analyzed viruses was decreased, rhinovirus infection becomes prevalent.

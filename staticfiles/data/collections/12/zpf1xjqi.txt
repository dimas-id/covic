The evaluation and management of thrombocytopenia is a daily challenge for clinicians in the intensive care unit (ICU). Thrombocytopenia is incredibly common, present in upwards of 60% of ICU patients. Additionally, thrombocytopenia in the critically ill is rarely caused by a single etiology. Several causes of thrombocytopenia in the ICU including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura demand urgent recognition and intervention. This chapter provides a general overview of thrombocytopenia in the ICU and highlights important diagnostic and management considerations for some of the most common etiologies.

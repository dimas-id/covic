OBJECTIVES Investigate whether asymmetrical corticospinal excitability exists in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its association with MS symptoms. METHODS Bilateral resting and active motor thresholds (RMT, AMT) were gathered using transcranial magnetic stimulation among 82 MS patients. Corticospinal excitability (CSE) asymmetry was expressed as the ratio between weaker and stronger sides' RMT and AMT. Stronger and weaker side was determined by pinch and grip strength. We examined whether CSE asymmetry predicted symptoms. RESULTS AMT asymmetry ratio revealed atypical CSE asymmetry whereby the hemisphere associated with the weaker hand was more excitable in early MS. After controlling for MS disease demographics, shifting of CSE asymmetry towards greater excitability in the stronger side significantly predicted more severe symptoms including Expanded Disease Severity Scale, nine-hole peg test, cognitive processing speed, walking speed, heat sensitivity, fatigue, and subjective impact of MS. CONCLUSION CSE asymmetry significantly predicted the severity of MS-related physical and objective cognitive symptoms. The phenomenon may be related to neuroinflammation-mediated hyperexcitability. Shifting of asymmetry toward less excitability on the weaker side may suggest the onset of a more neurodegenerative phase of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE Shifting of hemispheric excitability, detected using a CSE asymmetry ratio, may be a useful biomarker to track disease progression and understand the benefits of treatments.

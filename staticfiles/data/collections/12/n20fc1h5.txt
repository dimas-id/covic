OBJECTIVE This study aimed to report the clinical outcomes for patients with osteoid osteoma (OO) treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using a three-dimensional (3D) navigation system. METHODS We performed RFA using a 3D navigation system on 32 patients with clinically and radiologically diagnosed OO. This study included 25 males and 7 females with a median age of 20 years (range, 10-39 years). The median duration of follow-up was 18 months (range, 1-65 months). We investigated technical specifications, tumor localization, technical success, clinical success, biopsy success, complications, incomplete treatment, and recurrences. RESULTS Eighteen tumors were located in the femur, seven in the tibia, two in the humerus, and one each in the fibula, scapula, patella, lumbar vertebra, and acetabula. All procedures were technically successful, and pain relief was achieved in all patients. However, local recurrence developed in one patient, needing additional RFA. The clinical success rate was 96.8%. Biopsy showed OO in 12 patients (37%). Complications occurred in three patients (9%), two cases of fractures and one of osteomyelitis. CONCLUSIONS A 3D navigation provides real-time imaging and enables us to set the RFA needle in the correct position, particularly in case of OO-aroused complex anatomical structures. Our initial results indicated that radiofrequency ablation using a 3D navigation system is feasible and safe for patients with OO.

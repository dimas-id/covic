Gastric leakage is a challenging complication of sleeve gastrectomy. Multimodal approaches, including drainage, clipping, and stenting of the leak, are occasionally insufficient. We report successful management of refractory gastric leakage using percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG). Drainage and stenting proved inadequate for treating sleeve leakage near the esophagogastric junction in two patients. PTEG was finally performed, and enteral feeding was started on the following day. The patients were discharged within 1 week. The PTEG-tube was removed after confirming oral food intake. Both patients continue to do well without recurrence. PTEG was developed for patients who are unsuitable for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. PTEG provides decompression and permits enteral feeding in patients refractory to other endoscopic treatments. PTEG is an option for managing intractable sleeve leakage without surgery.

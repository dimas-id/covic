CD26 is a 110 kDa surface glycoprotein with intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity that is expressed on numerous cell types and has a multitude of biological functions. The role of CD26 in immune regulation has been extensively characterized, with recent findings elucidating its linkage with signaling pathways and structures involved in T-lymphocyte activation as well as antigen presenting cell-T-cell interaction. In this paper, we will review emerging data on CD26-mediated immune regulation suggesting that CD26 may be an appropriate therapeutic target for the treatment of selected immune disorders as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Moreover, we have had a long-standing interest in the role of CD26 in cancer biology and its suitability as a novel therapeutic target in selected neoplasms. We reported robust in vivo data on the anti-tumor activity of anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody in mouse xenograft models. We herein review significant novel findings and the early clinical development of a CD26-targeted therapy in selected immune disorders and cancers, advances that can lead to a more hopeful future for patients with these intractable diseases.

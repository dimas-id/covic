Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a coronavirus, can cause acute diarrhea and dehydration in pigs. In the current study, two positive monoclonal cell lines (5D7 and 3H4) specific for PEDV were established, and the immunoreactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence and dot-immunobinding assays. A method, termed antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA), which used the monoclonal antibody 5D7 as the detecting antibody and rabbit antiserum of PEDV protein S as the capture antibody, was developed. Compared with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method of detecting PEDV in fecal samples, AC-ELISA showed similar sensitivity and specificity. These results suggested that AC-ELISA would be useful for the diagnosis and epidemiological studies of PEDV.

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the survival of adult and pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation and determine the associated risk factors METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in the intensive care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) and King Abdullah Childrenâ€™s Specialist Hospital (KACSH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The analysis includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. For each patient, potential risk factors were collected. The main outcome of this study was the mortality during the stay in ICU after receiving mechanical ventilation RESULTS: A total of 262 adults and 175 pediatric patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation during the study period. For adult patients, the overall mortality was 37%, with a median survival time of 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-20 days). The main risk factors independently associated with the increased mortality rate were being aged 51-60 (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-1.0) and factors related to ICU admission. For the pediatric population, the mortality rate was 17%, with a median survival time of 16 days (IQR 7-37 days). Prematurity with respiratory problems was the main recorded cause of initiation of mechanical ventilation (50% of patients). Neonates who had mechanical ventilation within one month of their birth and were born extremely preterm had a high mortality rate after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Both patient age and the causes of the initiation of mechanical ventilation were influencing the survival of patients who required mechanical ventilation.

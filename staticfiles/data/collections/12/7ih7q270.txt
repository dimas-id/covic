Abstract Our lives depend upon a constant supply of clean air to breathe, in the home, city, countryside or at our place of work. Air is also consumed in huge volumes for the production of power. Any particulate matter in this air will affect the efficiency and cleanliness of combustion and reduce the lifetime of engine or turbine parts. The off-gases downstream from combustion present a huge environmental problem, either in the local environment or in terms of their impact regionally or even globally. This section reviews the techniques and equipment used to purify air.

The histo-inhibitory factor (HIF) derived from homogenates of liver or kidney from hamsters infected withHistoplasma capsulatum has been fractionated by column chromatography. It shows maximum absorption at 280 mµ, has a molecular weight of 142,000 and can be eluted from DEAE-cellulose or DEAE-Sephadex A—50 with 0.02 M phosphate — 4 M sodium chloride (1 : 1) HIF can be eluted fromHistoplasma yeast cells at pH 10.0, thus a greater number of positive cultures from chronic histoplasmosis could be expected to result from pretreatment of clinical specimens in glycine buffer pH 10.0 prior to culture.

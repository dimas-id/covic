BACKGROUND Laproscopic single-site surgery is the natural evolution of minimally invasive surgery. METHODS A 70-year-old male was planned for a resection of a gastric GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor). A Triport trocar (Olympus, Aartselaar, Belgium) was placed through a 2-cm periumbilical incision. Besides the placement of a Nathanson liver retractor in the subxiphoidal position, no additional trocars had to be added. The partial gastrectomy was carried out by using clinical prototypes of double-bended intruments and of a "goose neck" videolaparoscope, all specially designed for single-port surgery. RESULTS Total operative time was 140 minutes, and estimated blood loss was 10 mL. No intra- or postoperative complications occurred. Hospital stay was 4 days. Final pathology revealed the complete resection of a GIST tumor of gastric origin. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated the technical feasibility and described the detailed surgical technique of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery gastric wedge resection.

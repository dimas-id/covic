Intracellular pathogens use complex and tightly regulated processes to enter host cells. Upon initial interactions with signaling proteins at the surface of target cells, intracellular microbes activate and co-opt specific host signaling pathways that mediate cell surface-cytosol communications to facilitate pathogen internalization. Here, we discuss the roles of host receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the establishment of productive infections by major intracellular pathogens. We evaluate the gaps in the current understanding of this process and propose a comprehensive approach for assessing the role of host cell signaling in the biology of intracellular microorganisms and viruses. We also discuss RTK-targeting strategies for the treatment of various infections.

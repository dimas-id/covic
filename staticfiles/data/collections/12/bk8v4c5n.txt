BACKGROUND AND AIM: The current vaccination for peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) is stalled by myriad challenges and continuous endemicity of pneumonia due to fulminant bacterial complication in goats. The present study evaluated the protective effect of intranasal PPRV linage 1 and bacterine vaccinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve West African Dwarf (WAD) goats aged 6 months were randomly grouped and vaccinated within 2 weeks using a combination of PPRV lineage 1 vaccine (Nig/75), and bacterin from Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh) or Pasteurella multocida intranasally. The goats were observed for 3 weeks post-vaccination before comingled with a known infected WAD goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants and further observed clinically for 5 weeks post-infection (PI). Blood samples were taken for hematology while sera were assayed for antioxidants (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and superoxide dismutase) activities and pro-oxidants (malondialdehyde content, reduced glutathione, hydrogen peroxide generation(,) and myeloperoxidase) using spectrophotometric methods. Data were subjected to parametric statistics at Î±=0.05 using GraphPad Prism version 21. RESULTS: Clinically, there were pyrexia, oculonasal discharge, diarrhea, anemia, leukopenia, and increased pro-oxidants in the unvaccinated goats, while moderate neutrophilia and leukocytosis were observed in PPRV and bacterin vaccinated goats. Two unvaccinated goats were weak and euthanized at 13 and 28 days PI. The goats vaccinated with PPRV and Mh showed better response clinically and biochemically. CONCLUSION: The mucosal vaccination of goats with PPRV vaccine and bacterine will protect against exposure and culminate in the development of protective mucosal, humoral, and cell-mediated immune responses. This vaccination strategy will provide framework needed in the prevention and control of endemic caprine pneumonia in Nigeria.

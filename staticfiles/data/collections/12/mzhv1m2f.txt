We present a tool for using the B language in computational notebooks, based on the Jupyter Notebook interface and the ProB tool. Applications of B notebooks include executable documentation of formal models, interactive manuals, validation reports but also teaching of formal methods, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. In addition to B and Event-B, the tool supports Z, [Formula: see text] and Alloy.

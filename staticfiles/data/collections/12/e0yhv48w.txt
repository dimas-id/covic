BACKGROUND The use of electronic records in healthcare is increasing. To avoid errors, it is essential that the data displays used by these systems are usable: efficient, effective and satisfying. A wide variety of display techniques are used to present clinical data, but the best methods to assess the usability of these techniques have not been determined. This systematic review will answer the question: What methods are employed to assess the usability of electronic visualisations of patient data for clinical use? The results of this systematic review will then be used to inform best assessment and design practice. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OpenGrey, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched for original studies related to the usability of electronic information visualisations of patient data for clinical use. Reference lists of eligible studies and relevant reviews will be explored to identify further eligible studies. DISCUSSION This systematic review will identify methods used to assess the usability of electronic information visualisations of patient data for clinical use. We will summarise the similarities and differences between the methods found. Our results will inform best practice when developing new user interfaces to display electronic patient data for clinical use. TRIAL REGISTRATION PROSPERO CRD42016041604.

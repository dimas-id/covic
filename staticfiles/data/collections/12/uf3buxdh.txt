Mitomycin C as a treatment for superficial bladder carcinomas and upper urinary tract tumours has been linked to local adverse events. Systemic toxicity has been documented for just a very few cases. This report presents a case of interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by myelosuppression in a 74-year-old patient after receiving the fifth administration of mitomycin C through a ureteral catheter as a treatment for left kidney pyelocaliceal urothelial carcinoma. Therefore, suspecting mitomycin C toxicity, urinary tract instillations were discontinued, and intravenous filgrastim and methylprednisolone were initiated. Currently, after five months since the last mitomycin C urinary tract instillation, the patient is still receiving filgrastim and corticosteroids. A moderate effort dyspnoea persists despite interstitial pulmonary infiltrates have presented a very important reduction. Pancytopenia has also persisted. Blood count and lung function monitoring would be appropriate in patients undergoing mitomycin C instillations, especially in those with established prior lung disease.

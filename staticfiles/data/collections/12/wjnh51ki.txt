Planning and design of a unique biocontainment unit specifically for care of patients with rare and highly infectious diseases presented an opportunity for nurse leaders to engage staff in crucial groundbreaking decisions. The MagnetÂ® philosophy and framework were used to structure committees with key stakeholders and staff to ensure best and safe practices. Members of the biocontainment unit are engaged in active research and outreach training.

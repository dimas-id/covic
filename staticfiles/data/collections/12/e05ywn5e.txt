Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The novel coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has led to a global pandemic. The virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets from an infected person, but environmental contamination can also act as a source of infection, making social distancing an important key in containing the spread of infection. Those with underlying health conditions are more susceptible to complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, which can be fatal. However, healthy individuals experience a mild flu-like illness or may be asymptomatic, recuperating from the infection even without any particular intervention. We present a case of a healthy COVID positive individual, with no underlying comorbidities, who rapidly deteriorated overnight on readmission to the hospital after initial discharge and succumbed to this disease due to a superimposed bacterial infection with COVID pneumonia. This case report highlights the importance of educating COVID-19 positive patients about the precautions, as well as signs and symptoms of a superimposed bacterial infection, when their plan of care is in a home setting. It also emphasizes the potential role of checking procalcitonin levels as a part of routine laboratory investigation at initial presentation in all suspected as well as confirmed COVID-19 cases to rule out an on-going bacterial infection that can prove fatal in the course of the disease.

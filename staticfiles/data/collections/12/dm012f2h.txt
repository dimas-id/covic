OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the frequency and effects of nosocomial respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in premature neonates, including those who may be asymptomatic. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a year-long surveillance for RVIs in infants <33 weeks gestational age admitted to two Syracuse neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Infants were enrolled within 3 days of NICU admission and were sampled for RVIs until discharge using a multiplex PCR assay capable of detecting 17 different respiratory viruses or subtypes. RESULTS: 26 of 50 prematurely born infants (52%) tested positive for a respiratory virus at least once during their birth hospitalization. Testing positive for a respiratory virus was significantly associated with longer length of stay (70 days vs. 35 days, p = 0.002) and prolonged ventilatory support (51 vs. 13 days, p = 0.002). Infants who tested positive for a respiratory virus during their birth hospitalization had more than twice the rate of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nosocomial RVIs were frequent in our study population, despite the absence of clinical indicators of illness. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer and a diagnosis of BPD was more common in those premature infants who had respiratory viruses detected.

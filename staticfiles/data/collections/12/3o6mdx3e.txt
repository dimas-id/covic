mRNA display is a genotype–phenotype conjugation method that allows for amplification-based, iterative rounds of in vitro selection to be applied to peptides and proteins. mRNA display can be used to display both long natural protein and short synthetic peptide libraries with unusually high diversities for the investigation of protein–protein interactions. Here, we summarize the advantages of mRNA display by comparing it with other widely used peptide or protein-selection techniques, and discuss various applications of this technique in studying protein–protein interactions.

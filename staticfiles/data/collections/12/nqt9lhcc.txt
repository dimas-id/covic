Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has emerged as a highly contagious, sometimes fatal disease. To find disease-specific B cell epitopes, phage-displayed random peptide libraries were panned on serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies from patients with SARS. Forty-nine immunopositive phage clones that bound specifically to serum from patients with SARS were selected. These phageborne peptides had 4 consensus motifs, of which 2 corresponded to amino acid sequences reported for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARSCoV). Synthetic peptide binding and competitive-inhibition assays further confirmed that patients with SARS generated antibodies against SARS-CoV. Immunopositive phage clones and epitope-based peptide antigens demonstrated clinical diagnostic potential by reacting with serum from patients with SARS. Antibody-response kinetics were evaluated in 4 patients with SARS, and production of IgM, IgG, and IgA were documented as part of the immune response. In conclusion, B cell epitopes of SARS corresponded to novel coronavirus. Our epitope-based serologic test may be useful in laboratory detection of the virus and in further study of the pathogenesis of SARS.

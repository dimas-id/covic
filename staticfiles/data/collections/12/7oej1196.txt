Neutral evolution is the default process of the genome changes. This is because our world is finite and the randomness is important when we consider history of a finite world. The random nature of DNA propagation is discussed using branching process, coalescent process, Markov process, and diffusion process. Expected evolutionary patterns under neutrality are then discussed on fixation probability, rate of evolution, and amount of DNA variation kept in population. We then discuss various features of neutral evolution starting from evolutionary rates, synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, junk DNA, and pseudogenes.

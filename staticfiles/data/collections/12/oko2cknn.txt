The Keystone Symposium on Cell Biology of Virus Entry, Replication, and Pathogenesis held in Taos, New Mexico February 29 to March 5, 2000 to a large degree fulfilled its purpose to facilitate interdisciplinary exchange of information. The Keynote Address by Sir John J. Skehel (National Institute for Medical Research, London) initiated discussion on the antigenic analyses of influenza virus hemagglutinins. Subsequent topics covered the earliest events in viral receptor-mediated entry through membrane fusion to virus assembly, genetics, pathogenesis, and immunology. While a significant number of taxonomically different viruses was discussed, several common themes emerged from plenary sessions and poster workshops. A few selected topics are highlighted below.

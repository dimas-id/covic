BACKGROUND The development of the human kidney is a complex process requiring interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The condensed cap mesenchyme is hypothesized to generate a population of stem/progenitor cells that undergo mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) originating nephrons. Few immunohistochemical markers are available for detecting cap mesenchymal cells in the early phases of MET. METHODS The expression of MUC1 was evaluated in the kidneys, of 4 human foetuses and 2 newborns. RESULTS MUC1 immunoreactivity was detected in all the examined kidneys in the cap mesenchyme and in the renal vesicles. Immunostaining for MUC1 in cap mesenchymal cells changed from one nodule to the next: some mesenchymal nodules were negative, some showed MUC1 reactivity in scattered cells, whereas in others, positive cells revealed the presence of a roundish developing epithelial structure. CONCLUSIONS Our data clearly indicates, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, immunohistochemical evidence of MUC1 expression during human kidney development. We focused on MUC1 reactivity in the cap mesenchyme. On the basis of these preliminary data, we speculate that MUC1 may be involved in human nephrogenesis and may play a relevant role in MET from the cap mesenchyme to the renal vesicle, changing the fate of renal stem/progenitor cells.

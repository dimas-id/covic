BACKGROUND: Neonates with apnea of prematurity often fail CPAP because it does not provide adequate support during apnea. NAVA provides proportional ventilator support based on electrical activity of the diaphragm. When the NAVA level is 0 cmH(2)0/mcV, the patient receives minimal support above PEEP when breathing and backup ventilation when apneic. This study compares number of clinically significant events on CPAP versus noninvasive NAVA level 0. METHODS: Retrospective study of preterm neonates having apnea of prematurity on nasal CPAP. Patients were then placed on NAVA level 0. The number of events on each mode was collected. Statistics were paired t-test. RESULTS: Seventeen subjects with gestational age 26.1 ± 1.7 weeks, study age 19.5 ± 12.5 days. Events decreased from 17.9 ± 7.8 on CPAP to 10.2 ± 8.1 events on NAVA level 0 (p = 0.00047). CONCLUSIONS: NAVA level 0 reduced the number of clinically significant events compared with CPAP in premature neonates with apnea of prematurity.

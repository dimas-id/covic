OBJECTIVE To report the successful application of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist to a child with cystic fibrosis who underwent single-lung transplantation. DESIGN Case report. SETTING Pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. PATIENT A 15-yr-old male with cystic fibrosis was admitted to our pediatric cardiac intensive care unit after single-lung transplantation. The child had previously received two bowel resections at the age of 1 yr, right pneumonectomy at the age of 3 yrs, and endoscopic percutaneus gastrostomy at the age of 10 yrs. After transplant, the child failed several attempts of weaning off mechanical ventilation with pressure-support ventilation, due to infection, pneumothorax, and ventilator asynchrony that caused gastric distension and numerous episodes of nausea and vomiting. INTERVENTION Use of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist to avoid patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and consequent gastric distension. CONCLUSIONS The utilization of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist allowed to limit the risk of overassistance and prevent patient-ventilator asynchrony and to successfully wean the child off mechanical ventilation after single-lung transplant.

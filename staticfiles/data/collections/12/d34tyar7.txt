Dried plasma provides an alternative for early plasma transfusion in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock in environments where fresh frozen plasma is not immediately available. It is produced by freeze-drying or spray-drying liquid or thawed plasma. It is shelf-stable for prolonged periods, can be stored at room temperature, and is easy to transport, reconstitute, and administer. It was widely used in WWII but fell out of favor due to the risk of infectious disease transmission. The German and French experiences with lyophilized plasma are the most extensive and show a good track record of efficacy and safety. Recent studies show many beneficial effects of dried plasma in the treatment of shock in large animal models. Currently, no FDA-licensed product is available in the USA, but several are under development.

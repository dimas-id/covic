During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a re-organisation of care provided by the Trauma and Orthopaedic services in the United Kingdom. The National Health Service England (NHSE) speciality guide forms the primary responses to this pandemic, whilst British Society for the Surgery of Hand (BSSH) provides sub-specialty guidance on management of hand trauma. The orthopaedic community's responsibility of providing a continuity of care for patients has to be balanced with measures to reduce risk of viral transmission (e.g. reduce face to face consultations) and also protect ion of both the patients and staff. We highlight the strategies applied whilst reconfiguration of hand injury management following publication of COVID-19 British Society for the Surgery of Hand and Indian Orthopaedic Association (IOA) guidelines.

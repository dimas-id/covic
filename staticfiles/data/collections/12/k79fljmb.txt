INTRODUCTION: For war-injured refugees, spinal cord injury (SCI) is a leading cause of catastrophic neurologic injury and literature focused on the care of this vulnerable population is sparse. This case series describes the unique challenges presented to an outpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation team in providing SCI care in the USA for refugees who suffered their SCI in their home countries. CASE PRESENTATION: Our interdisciplinary rehabilitation team faced challenges related to language, cultural and educational barriers which impacted the typical standard rehabilitation care offered to these individuals. Many of the individuals were focused on curative treatments. As such, managing expectations and educating individuals to rehabilitation practices for chronic SCI and lack of curative treatments for associated medical complications affected the provision of care across all disciplines of the rehabilitation team. DISCUSSION: This case series showcases the challenges of caring for international refugees with SCI. The care offered to these individuals highlights the benefits that an interdisciplinary SCI rehabilitation approach can provide to comprehensively care for this vulnerable population.

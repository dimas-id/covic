Pregnant women are a potentially highly vulnerable population due to anatomical, physiological and immunological changes under the Covid‐19 pandemic. Issues related to pregnancy with Covid‐19 attracted widespread attention from researchers. A large number of articles were published aiming to elaborate clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women infected with Covid‐19, in order to provide evidence for management. The existing data suggest that the overall prognosis of pregnancy with Covid‐19 is promising when compared with that of other previous coronaviruses. There is still maternal morbidity and mortality related to Covid‐19 reported. However, the optimal management of severe and critically ill cases of Covid‐19‐infected‐pregnancy is poorly clarified. The possibility of postpartum exacerbation in pregnancy with Covid‐19 is also worthy of attention for obstetricians. This review makes further elaboration of the above issues.

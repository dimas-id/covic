The severity of COVID-19 disease has led to an urgent need for the discovery of new treatments. Thus, global stocks of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been put under pressure with a study of 26 patients treated with HCQ during their infection with SARS-CoV-2. Despite the study's lack of quality, several countries' medicines agencies subsequently issued guidelines for the use of HCQ for COVID-19. This review aims to elucidate potential mechanisms, which make HCQ treatment interesting in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the current evidence for clinical use of HCQ to treat COVID-19.

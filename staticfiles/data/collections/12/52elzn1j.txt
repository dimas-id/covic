INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS The objectives of this study are to investigate myofascial pain in patients with interstitial cystitis (IC) and to correlate myofascial exam findings with validated questionnaires. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed on 186 patients with a diagnosis of IC from April 2007 to December 2008. Demographics, history and physical examination, and validated pelvic floor dysfunction questionnaire scores were extracted. The data was evaluated with SPSS for Windows using Spearman's rho, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis statistical analyses. RESULTS Myofascial pain was demonstrated in 78.3% of IC patients with at least one myofascial trigger point, and 67.9% of patients had numerous areas of trigger points. Mild correlations were seen with trigger points and scores from the PUF, PFDI-20, and PFIQ-7 questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS Myofascial pain is prevalent among IC patients and positively correlated with pelvic floor dysfunction scores. These findings support evaluation of pelvic floor myofascial pain in IC patients and suggest a possible benefit from pelvic floor therapy.

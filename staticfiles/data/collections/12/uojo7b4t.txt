Over the last few years, evidence has accumulated that the pathogenetic mechanism of disseminated intravascular coagulation encountered in patients with infectious diseases is extraordinarily complex and involves multiple interactions between the microorganism itself and/or a number of mediators, both microorganism derived and host manufactured, and multifunctional cellular systems, namely endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes. In particular, infectious agents and mediators shift the coagulation-fibrinolysis equilibrium of these cells towards fibrin formation and accumalation, via enhancement of procoagulant and fibrinolytic capacities. New insights into the pathogenetic mechanism may have important implications for the management of infected patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

The first hints of a global public health crisis emerged with the identification of a new strain of H1N1 influenza A in March and April 2009 in Mexico City. By June 11, the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak of 2009 H1N1 a global pandemic. Now, with the continued growing presence of 2009 H1N1 on the global scene, much attention has been focused on the key role of personal protective equipment in healthcare infection control. Much less emphasis has been placed on specific interventions that may minimize the increased infectious risk commonly associated with critical care delivery. Given the frequency of high-risk respiratory procedures such as intubation and delivery of aerosolized medications in the intensive care unit, the delivery of critical care presents unique infection control challenges and unique opportunities to augment usual infection control practice with specific source-control efforts. Here, we summarize data regarding risks to critical care healthcare workers from previous respiratory virus outbreaks, discuss findings from the early 2009 H1N1 experience that suggest reasons for increased concern for those delivering critical care, and review best available evidence regarding strategies for source control in respiratory and critical care delivery.

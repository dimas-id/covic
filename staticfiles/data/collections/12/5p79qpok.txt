In the midst of the chaos of the global pandemic, the online daily webinar series Blood and Bone was created. The series started with a blank schedule on a google doc and, with enthusiasm and participation from the hematopoiesis and hemostasis/thrombosis communities, was quickly filled through September 2020. In the absence of any editing of the speaker list, a diverse, well-balanced, and scientifically exciting program emerged. The seminar is hosted on Zoom and live-streamed on YouTube daily, and can accommodate up to 1000 attendees. Attendance has topped over 600 and averages 200-300 people daily; this has been sustained for 7 weeks. In addition, there is a weekly Thursday trainee series that hosts 3, 20-minute seminars. In this forum, we reflect on a series that allowed global scientists to come together to help shape chaos into an opportunity for community and growth.

The taxonomic relationship between heterotrophic and parasitic dinoflagellates has not been studied extensively at the molecular level. In order to investigate these taxonomic relationships, we sequenced the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene of Pfiesteria piscicida (Steidinger et Burkholder), a Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate, Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., and Amyloodinium ocellatum (Brown) and submitted those sequences to GenBank. Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp. are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A. ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P. piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full‐length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., P. piscicida, and the Pfiesteria‐like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A. ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely related to the apicomplexans or to Perkinsus marinus, the parasite that causes “Dermo disease” in oysters. The overall phylogenetic analyses largely supported the current class and subclass groupings within the dinoflagellates.

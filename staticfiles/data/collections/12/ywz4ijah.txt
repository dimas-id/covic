The unprecedented scale of the CovID-19 disaster will define public health failure for generations to come. Its causes include inadequate funding, hostility towards science in general and public health science in particular, a government culture steeped in deception and misinformation, and a disdain for collaboration for the greater good among the community of nations. The consequences have been devastating, but it is essential that the public health community uses its moment in the spotlight to promote the agenda of science-based policy, honesty and transparency in communication, and international cooperation to advance the common good of humanity.

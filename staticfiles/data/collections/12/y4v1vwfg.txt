Abstract To control the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, many anthropogenic activities were reduced and even closed on the national scale. To study the impact of this reduction and closing down, hourly concentrations of PM2.5-related elements were measured at a rural site before (12–25 January 2020), during (26 January–9 February 2020) and after (22 March–2 April 2020) all people gathered in their homes and could not return to economic zones for work. Nine major sources were identified by the positive matrix factorization model, including fireworks burning, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, dust, Cr industry, oil combustion, Se industry, Zn smelter, and iron and steel industry. Before the control period, K, Fe, Ca, Zn, Ba and Cu were the main elements, and fireworks burning, Zn smelter and vehicle emissions provide the highest contributions to the total element mass with 55%, 12.1% and 10.3%, respectively. During the control period, K, Fe, Ba, Cu and Zn were the dominating elements, and fireworks burning and vehicle emissions contributed 55% and 27% of the total element mass. After the control period, Fe, K, Ca, Zn and Ba were the main elements, and dust and iron and steel industry were responsible for 56% and 21% of the total element mass. The increased contribution from vehicle emissions during the control period could be attributed to our sampling site being near a town hospital and the fact that the vehicle activities were not restricted. The source apportionment results were also related to air mass backward trajectories. The largest reductions of dust, coal combustion, and the industrial sources (Cr industry, Zn smelter, Se industry, iron and steel industry) were distinctly seen for northwest transport (Ulanqab) and were least significant for northeast transport (Tangshan and Tianjin).

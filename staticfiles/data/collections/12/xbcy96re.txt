Abstract Viral infection dynamics and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) treatment rates were studied over six years at a Swedish bull testing station with an ‘all in, all out’ management system. In August of each of the years 1998–2003, between 149 and 185 4–8-month-old calves arrived at the station from 99 to 124 different beef-breeding herds, and remained until March the following year. Only calves that tested free from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) were allowed to enter the station and original animal groups were kept isolated from new cattle in their original herds for three weeks before admission. Although neither prophylactic antibiotics, nor BRD vaccines were used, less than 0.7–13.2% (mean 5%) of the calves (n =970) required treatment for BRD during the first five weeks following entry. This was probably due, at least in part, to the season (the summer months) when the animals were commingled. In the six-month period August–February, 38% of the animals were treated one or more times for BRD and mortality was 0.7%. Hereford and Aberdeen Angus calves had significantly higher treatment rates than Charolais, Simmental and Blonde d’Aquitaine. Serological testing on samples obtained in August, November and January indicated that bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) infections occurred each year before November after entry. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infections also occurred every year, but in 3/6 years this was not until after November. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections occurred only every second year and were associated with a treatment peak and one death on one occasion (December). The herd remained BVDV free during the entire study period. The infection patterns for PIV-3 and BCoV indicated a high level of infectivity amongst bovine calves, whereas the incidence for BRSV was observed at a lower level. Although the rearing of the animals differed from conventional beef production, the study has shown that commingling animals from many sources is not necessarily associated with high morbidity within the first few weeks after arrival. By preventing BRD soon after commingling the prerequisites for protective vaccination at entry might be improved. Applied management routines are discussed.

AIM The study aims to examine recent childhood asthma hospitalisation rates in the Asia Pacific countries of Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. On the background of reported decline in many countries with high asthma prevalence during late 1990s. METHODS Annual asthma hospitalisation (ICD9-CM: 493 or ICD10-AM: J45-46)* and population data from 1994 to 2008, of children aged 0-14 years old, were obtained from the Australian National Hospital Morbidity Database, from the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong and from the Ministry of Health in Singapore. Data were stratified in two age groups: 0-4 and 5-14 years old, and also in different periods of calendar years. Time-series regression analyses were used to examine temporal trends. Diagnostic transfer was addressed by examining bronchitis hospitalisations. RESULTS Significant decreases of up to 6.5% per annum in childhood asthma hospitalisation rates were found over the study period. However, the latter half of the study period showed increases in hospitalisation rates in all countries studied. No evidence of diagnostic transfer was found. CONCLUSION Although there has been a decrease in childhood asthma hospitalisation rates since the 1990s, a modest increase was observed from 2003 to 2008. Ongoing monitoring is required.

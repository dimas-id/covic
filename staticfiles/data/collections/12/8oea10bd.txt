Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remain an important complication of solid organ transplantation owing to their significant morbidity and mortality and include infections due to Candida, Cryptococcus, endemic mycosis, and other rare yeasts and molds. IFIs occur in different intervals posttransplantation and depend on a number of extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors, some of which are specific to the type of organs transplanted, surgical techniques, and type of immunosuppressive medications. Donor-derived IFIs and emergence of new multidrug-resistant yeasts have been reported in various healthcare settings. Clinical manifestations of yeast and endemic fungal infections vary in different types of organ transplants. Diagnosis of IFIs in SOT recipients is challenging due to their nonspecific signs and symptoms owing to the impaired inflammatory responses as a result of immunosuppression and the lack of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic modalities. Early diagnosis is key to successful therapy, and physicians should have a high index of suspicion based on risk factors and epidemiology of these pathogens. Antifungal treatment strategies for yeast infections have been outlined in various society guidelines. Management of complications that arise before or during antifungal therapy is critical for optimizing clinical response.

The purpose of this study is to develop highly active titanium oxide photocatalysts that can be anchored onto a substrate. We have, thus, prepared a titanium oxide photocatalyst using a wet or dry process and the results of this study have led to the successful development of highly active rectangular column-structured titanium oxide photocatalysts, which can be anchored onto silica sheets. These highly active photocatalysts were then applied to develop an effective air purification system.

Abstract Objective Trying to establish the key technical indicators related to positive pressure biological protective clothing (PPBPC), providing technical support for the establishment of PPBPC standards in the future. Method We examined the protection standard systems established by the major standards organizations in China and other developed countries. We also analyzed the technical indicators of the gas-tight chemical protective clothing and ventilated protective clothing against particulate radioactive contamination which closely related to PPBPC. And tested the performance of a set of imported dual-purpose PPBPC to verify the fit of its technical indicators with the standards. We aimed to identify the status of Chinaâ€™s standards in the area of personnel protection and put forward feasible suggestions for the production of PPBPC in China. Results Developed countries in Europe and North America have a complete system of standard protective clothing. China should also strengthen the construction of standard protective clothing, especially PPBPC. Conclusion With the improvements in infectious disease prevention and control on a global scale, the demand for PPBPC continues to increase and consideration should be given to the establishment of standards for this.

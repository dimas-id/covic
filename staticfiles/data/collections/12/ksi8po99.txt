At present, all parts of the world are hit hard by COVID-19. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the territory of Hong Kong was announced on January 23, 2020. Since then, oculoplastic surgeons in Hong Kong have been taking every measure to protect all healthcare workers and patients from contracting the disease. This paper aims to share the experiences of and measures taken by local oculoplastic surgeons in combating COVID-19. Three main aspects are discussed, namely clinical, administrative, and training and educational. We hope our experiences would provide reference to fellow oculoplastic colleagues in other parts of the world in fighting this COVID-19 pandemic.

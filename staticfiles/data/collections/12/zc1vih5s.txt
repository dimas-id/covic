Influenza has significant morbidity and mortality. Some experts consider infection with influenza B as milder than that with influenza A. The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B in 2017–2018 influenza season. All hospitalized patients between October 2017 and April 2018 with laboratory-confirmed influenza A and B were included. The primary composite outcomes were pneumonia/myocarditis/encephalitis, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-/90-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rates. The study included 201 influenza A and 325 influenza B. For the primary composite outcome, no significant difference was demonstrated between influenza A and B. Rates of mortality were similar at 30 and 90 days. Influenza A had higher pneumonia rates and mechanical ventilation. On multivariate analysis, higher Charlson’s score, hypoalbuminemia, and vasopressor use were associated with 30-day mortality, while infection with either influenza A or B was not. Influenza A was associated with higher pneumonia and mechanical ventilation rates. However, influenza B resulted with similar 30-day mortality rate as influenza A.

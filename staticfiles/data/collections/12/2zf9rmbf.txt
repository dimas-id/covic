The exact risk of dying from COVID-19 has remained elusive and a topic of debate. The observed case fatality rates of 46 different countries are hypothesized to be dependent on their testing rates. An analytical test to this hypothesis suggests that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 could be consistent to a certain degree across all countries and states. The current global fatality rate is estimated to be around 1% and expected to converge between 1-3% when the pandemic ends. This model can be helpful to estimate the true infection rate for individual countries.

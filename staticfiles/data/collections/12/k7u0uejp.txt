BACKGROUND We aimed to retrospectively investigate the short-term outcome, technical feasibility, and safety of single incision transumbilical laparoscopic colorectal surgery (SITULCS) using conventional laparoscopic surgical instruments. METHODS From April 2009 to July 2012, 44 patients with colorectal tumors underwent SITULCS at our department by using conventional laparoscopic instruments. The operations included right hemicolectomy (n = 8), sigmoidectomy (n = 5), total colectomy (n = 4), anterior resection of rectal cancer (n = 23), and abdominoperineal resection of rectal cancer (n = 4). We accessed the intraperitoneal lesions by three trocars through a single triangle-shaped umbilical incision using conventional instruments. RESULTS We successfully completed SITULCS without specially designed instruments. No patient was converted to multiport laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. Only one case developed intraoperative bleeding and one postoperative adhesive intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION Our experience shows that SITULCS using conventional instruments is feasible, safe, and convenient.

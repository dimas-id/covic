Here we present a web interface that implements a comprehensive mechanistic model of the SARS-CoV-2 disease map in which the detailed activity of the human signaling circuits related to the viral infection and the different antiviral responses, including immune and inflammatory activities, can be inferred from gene expression experiments. Moreover, given to the mechanistic properties of the model, the effect of potential interventions, such as knock-downs, over-expression or drug effects (currently the system models the effect of more than 8000 DrugBank drugs) can be studied in specific conditions. By providing a holistic, systems biology approach to the understanding of the complexities of the viral infection process, this tool will become an important asset in the search for efficient antiviral treatments.

Repair of complex ventral hernias frequently results in postoperative complications. This study assessed postoperative outcomes in a consecutive cohort of patients with ventral hernias who underwent herniorrhaphy using components separation techniques and reinforcement with non-cross-linked intact porcine-derived acellular dermal matrix (PADM) performed by a single surgeon between 2008 and 2012. Postoperative outcomes of interest included incidence of seroma, wound infection, deep-vein thrombosis, bleeding, and hernia recurrence determined via clinical examination. Of the 47 patients included in the study, 25% were classified as having Ventral Hernia Working Group grade 1 risk, 62% as grade 2, 2% as grade 3, and 11% as grade 4; 49% had undergone previous ventral hernia repair. During a mean follow-up of 31 months, 3 patients experienced hernia recurrence, and 9 experienced other postoperative complications: 4 (9%) experienced deep-vein thrombosis; 3 (6%), seroma; 2 (4%), wound infection; and 2 (4%), bleeding. The use of PADM reinforcement following components separation resulted in low rates of postoperative complications and hernia recurrence in this cohort of patients undergoing ventral hernia repair.

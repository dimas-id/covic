Abstract Medical as well as non-medical practitioners specialized in oral health are at high risk of infection with the Coronavirus-19 (Covid-19) because of the proximity with potentially infected biological fluids. This risk is permanent, especially during examination, care and transfer of patients. Regarding the pandemic progression of Covid-19, efficient protocols of prevention are urgently needed. Based on our experience and on the recently reported guidelines from the French National Agency for Public Health (ARS, March 5, 2020), the French Society of Hospital Hygiene (SFHH, March 4, 2020) and the Department of Infectious Risk Prevention of the Hospitals of Paris-Public Assistance (APHP, March 6, 2020), we provide several recommendations for practitioners specialized in oral health, to protect themselves from nosocomial infections, especially Covid-19.

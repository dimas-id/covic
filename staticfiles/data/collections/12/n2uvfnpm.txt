The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) screening project has been conducted by the Red Crescent Society for 17 days with the aim of identifying and treating people with COVID-19, reducing road trips, and sensitizing people to the problem. Due to the shortage of testing devices, passengers were screened by measuring skin temperature. In 851 screening posts, 95 371 volunteers of Red Crescent monitored 21 640 866 people.Besides screening people, the stations have had other functions, including urging people to stay at home, restricting road trips, especially during the Iranian New Year holidays, reassuring the people that all relevant organizations are doing their best to respond to COVID-19, and the like. However, future research is still needed to analyze the cost-benefit of this plan and other possible options.

The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a mutated form of the feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV) that can present with a variety of clinical signs. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze abdominal ultrasonographic findings associated with cats with confirmed FIPV infection. Sixteen cases were included in the study from a review of medical records at two academic institutions; inclusion was based either on necropsy lesions (n=13) or a combination of histopathological, cytological, and clinicopathological findings highly suggestive of FIPV infection (n=3). The liver was judged to be normal in echogenicity in 11 (69%) cats, diffusely hypoechoic in three cats, focally hyperechoic in one cat, and focally hypoechoic in one cat. Five cats had a hypoechoic subcapsular rim in one (n=3) or both (n=2) kidneys. Free fluid was present in the peritoneal cavity in seven cats and in the retroperitoneal space in one cat. Abdominal lymphadenopathy was noted in nine cats. The spleen was normal in echogenicity in 14 cats and was hypoechoic in two. One cat had bilateral orchitis with loss of normal testicular architecture. Although none of these ultrasonographic findings are specific for FIPV infection, a combination of these findings should increase the index of suspicion for FIPV infection when considered along with appropriate clinical signs.

Identifying nodes in social networks that have great influence on information dissemination is of great significance for monitoring and guiding information dissemination. There are few methods to study the influence of communities on social networks among the existing node importance evaluation algorithms, and it is difficult to find nodes that promote information dissemination among communities. In view of this reason, this paper proposes a node importance evaluation algorithm based on community influence (abbreviated as IEBoCI algorithm), which evaluates the importance of the nodes based on the influence degree of the nodes on the communities and the ability to disseminate information the communities to which the nodes are connected. This algorithm firstly calculates the activation probability of nodes to other nodes, which is used to divide communities and evaluate influence. Secondly, the network is divided into communities based on LPA algorithm. Finally, the importance of the node is calculated by combining the influence of the community itself and the influence of the node on the community. Experiments are carried out on real social network data and compared with other community-based methods to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

SARS-CoV-2 is usually transmitted through air however several recent reports have found the virus in urine. Only 187 urine samples have been reported to have been tested in the literature to date despite over 4 million cases of respiratory Covid 19 positive cases being reported worldwide. Of these 187 urine tests 6 were positive for the virus and this persisted in urine in once case for up to 42 days. The urine sample was still positive for Covid 19 despite respiratory swabs being negative. There is a potential concern therefore that Endourologists who generally perform a high number of urine prone procedures could be at risk of exposure to the virus peri operatively. There is still confusion as to the type of PPE Endourologists should use and in what circumstances. Until it is proven that urine is not a potential source for transmission of the Virus Endourologists should have a clear knowledge of the different types of PPE available and what they should use when performing procedures.

Radiation dose is a contentious issue in pediatrics, as it is well-established that the lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to CT examinations are considerably higher than for adults. As proposed by the ALARA principle ‘as low as reasonably achievable’, the selection of appropriate scanning parameters focuses on the optimization of image quality whilst delivering the lowest possible radiation dose and shifting the risk-benefit balance towards benefit.

Health authorities usually exploit after-action reports to collect data on their experience in responding to public health emergencies. To develop an effective approach to manage and learning from health emergencies, we have launched Isfahan COvid-19 REgistry for data collection during routine clinical care as a first “critical incident registry” in Iran. Registries can be employed to explain the natural history of the disease, learn about a particular disease in terms of patient outcomes, the cost-effectiveness of clinical management, monitoring the quality of health-care service, and developing research hypotheses.

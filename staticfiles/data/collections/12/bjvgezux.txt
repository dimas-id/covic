Suppressing SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, requires that infected individuals are rapidly identified and isolated, on an ongoing basis. However, regular testing of every individual is expensive. We present an approach to pooled testing, based on the geometry of a hypercube, which enables fast, cost-effective identification of infected people when the prevalence of the virus is low. Field trials of this approach are now under way in Rwanda.

This chapter discusses lipids in viruses. Lipid forms an integral part of many viruses and exists either in the form of a continuous envelope or in lipoprotein complexes that surround a nucleoprotein core or helix. In general, the envelope can be described as a molecular container for the genetic material of the virus. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and are not known to carry genetic coding for enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. Hence, they generally contain the same classes of lipid as are found in the host cell or their membrane of assembly. Lipids make up 20â€“35% by weight of most viruses; however, there are exceptions such as vaccinia virus, which has only 5% lipid despite having a complex multimembrane envelope structure. Naked herpesvirus capsids closely resemble non-lipid-containing viruses such as adenovirus or polyoma virus, which are also assembled in the nucleus but show full infectivity without any envelope. Both naked and enveloped herpesvirus particles are found in infected cells; however, only enveloped particles are found in extracellular fluids.

A novel coronavirus pandemic may be particularly hazardous to health care workers. Airway management is an aerosol-producing high-risk procedure. To minimize the production of airborne droplets, including pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the endotracheal tube during procedures requiring lung deflation, we devised a technique to mitigate the risk of infection transmission to health care personnel.

Background Non-tunneled catheters (NTCs) are used for hemodialysis (HD) in many centers in which fluoroscopy is not easily accessed despite high complication rates and conditions requiring long-term HD. Therefore, here we aimed to evaluate the superiority of catheter-related outcomes after the application of tunneled cuffed catheter (TCC) without fluoroscopy versus unconditioned NTC insertion. Methods We divided the participants into two phases: those receiving NTCs between March 2010 and February 2011 (phase I), and those receiving TCCs or NTCs between March 2011 and February 2012 (phase II). Catheter survival, nurse satisfaction, and reasons for catheter removal were analyzed. Results Two hundred and sixty patients in phase I and 300 patients in phase II were enrolled in this study. The success rate of TCC insertion was 99.2%. The catheter survival rate in phase I was 65.5% at 1 month, while that in phase II was 74.9% at 1 month (p=0.023). We compared catheter survival between TCCs and NTCs for all periods regardless of phase. The TCC survival rate was higher than the NTC survival rate (p<0.001). Catheter-associated problems led to catheter removal in 97 patients (26.6%) in phase I and 68 patients (18.5%) in phase II (p=0.009). Among 14 HD nurses, all reported being satisfied with manipulation during pre-/post-HD, manupulation during HD, and overall. Eleven HD nurses (78.6%) reported being satisfied with the workload. Conclusion Compared with unconditional NTC insertion for HD, TCC insertion without fluoroscopy improved the overall catheter survival and nurse satisfaction rates.

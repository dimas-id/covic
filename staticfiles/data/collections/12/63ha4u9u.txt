A distinguishing feature of high-grade gliomas is the infiltration of neoplastic cells into adjacent brain tissues that mark most of these tumors surgically incurable. To study the factors associated with tumor invasion, we established a new murine brain tumor model, ALTS1C1 derived from SV40 large T antigen-transfected astrocytes. This new brain tumor model recapitulates several histopathological features of human high-grade glioma including increased cellularity, prominent cellular pleomorphism, geographic necrosis, active mitosis, and extensive invasion of tumor cells into adjacent brain tissues. More importantly, ALTS1C1 expressed a relatively high level of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) in vitro and in vivo and higher microvascular density (MVD) in vivo. To define the roles of SDF-1 in this tumor model, the expression of SDF-1 in ALTS1C1 cells was inhibited by specific siRNA. SDF-knockdown ALTS1C1 (SDF(kd)) cells took longer than parental ALTS1C1 cells to form tumors and in contrast to the wild-type tumors they had well-defined regular borders and lacked infiltration tracts. The SDF(kd) tumors were also associated with a lower MVD and more hypoxic areas. In contrast to parental tumors, the density of F4/80-positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in SDF(kd) tumor was higher in non-hypoxic than in hypoxic regions. SDF-1 production by tumor cells therefore seems critical for the aggregation of TAMs into areas of hypoxia and tumor invasiveness. This study not only provides new insight into the role of SDF-1 in brain tumor invasion and the relationship between TAMs and hypoxia, but also provides a new preclinical brain tumor model for designing new treatment options for invasive cases.

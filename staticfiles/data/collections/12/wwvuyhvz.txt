Several modifiable environmental factors—such as outdoor air pollution, household air pollution, drinking water contamination, occupational exposure to hazardous materials, lead exposure, and built environments that discourage physical activity—influence the risk and experience of chronic disease. The World Health Organization estimates that 21.2% of global deaths and 16.3% of global disability-adjusted life years lost are attributable to these risk factors. There are several approaches for estimating the number of deaths and chronic illnesses attributable to these factors. Managing and mitigating environmentally related chronic illness begins with the administration of an environmental health history.

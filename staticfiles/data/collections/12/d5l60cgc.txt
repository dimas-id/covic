Abstract This article summarizes progress in research on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) since a FAO-OIE-WHO Global Technical Meeting held at WHO Headquarters in Geneva on 25â€“27 September 2017. The meeting reviewed the latest scientific findings and identified and prioritized the global activities necessary to prevent, manage and control the disease. Critical needs for research and technical guidance identified during the meeting have been used to update the WHO R&D MERS-CoV Roadmap for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines and a broader public health research agenda. Since the 2017 meeting, progress has been made on several key actions in animal populations, at the animal/human interface and in human populations. This report also summarizes the latest scientific studies on MERS since 2017, including data from more than 50 research studies examining the presence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels.

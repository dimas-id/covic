Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access. This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy. Addition of HIPEC must be discussed case by case in an expert center. The prioritization of indications must consider local conditions and the phase of the epidemic to allow optimal peri-operative care.

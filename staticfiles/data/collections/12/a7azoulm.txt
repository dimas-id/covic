Thanks to the transmission characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, Internet-based hospitals can effectively cut off the transmission route via online consulting service. The hospital, leveraging the UTAUT model and DST theory, and advantages of Internet-based hospitals, is deploying step by step such four modules, as &quot;pre-hospital screening&quot;, &quot;patient acceptance&quot;, &quot;auxiliary diagnosis and treatment&quot;, and &quot;prevention and control linkage&quot;. These efforts ultimately contribute to an innovative prevention and control pattern against the novel coronary pneumonia for Internet-based hospitals and based on the UTAUT-DST model. This practice proves an initial success, and offers useful references for prevention and control of the NCP and development of other Internet-based hospitals.

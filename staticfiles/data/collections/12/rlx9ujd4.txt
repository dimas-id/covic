BACKGROUND Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, also known as Wilkie's syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by vascular compression of the duodenum that leads to intestinal obstruction. While there have been a few recent case reports of laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy performed as an option for surgical treatment, the role of the da Vinci(Â®) robot in superior mesenteric syndrome has been underestimated. The authors report a robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy for the treatment of SMA syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 39-year-old man with a history of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis presented with an upper gastrointestinal obstruction with distended abdomen. A computed tomography scan showed a transition in the third portion of the duodenum where the SMA vessels crossed over, with a decompressed jejunum. He was identified as a candidate for a duodenojejunostomy. The da Vinci Surgical System was used to mobilize the colon and duodenum, and a Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy was performed with hand-sewn anastomosis. RESULTS There were no intraoperative complications. The blood loss was minimal and operative time was 120 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful with resolution of intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION Robotic Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy as a surgical option for treatment of SMA syndrome is safe, feasible, and a valid alternative to open surgery with the added benefits of a minimally invasive approach.

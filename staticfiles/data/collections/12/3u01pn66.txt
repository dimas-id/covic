Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a significant cause of respiratory illness in children and adults. Presently, there are no human data regarding the role of antibody for protection against hMPV illness. Therefore, we measured serum and nasal antibody titers against hMPV by EIA and neutralization assay at baseline in hMPV infected adults compared with subjects who remained uninfected. Antibody titers were also compared in patients with mild and severe illness. Mean serum binding and neutralizing antibody titers of hMPV infected subjects were significantly lower compared to uninfected subjects. Seventy-one percent of subjects with titers â‰¤10.5 (log 2) were infected compared to 36% with titers >10.5, p = 0.003. There was no difference in the mean acute antibody titers for patients with mild compared to severe illness. Serum antibody may play a role in protection from hMPV infection supporting the development of an hMPV vaccine that stimulates humoral immunity.

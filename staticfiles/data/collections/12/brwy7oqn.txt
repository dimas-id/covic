OBJECTIVE To know their real epidemiological histories in 1,091 probale cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) without definite history of contact with SARS patients in the first survey. METHODS All the probable SARS cases until June 9, 2003 without definite history of contact with SARS patients in the first epidemiological survey were included in a re-survey with questionnaire. The second survey was carried out during June 9 to 30, 2003. RESULTS The results showed that history of contact with other SARS patients was obtained in 15.9% of 1 091 probale SRAS cases in the second survey, transmission of SARS to others was found in 10.5% of them, and source of infection in hospital was found in 46.5%. Comprehensive judgement based on epidemiological history showed that probale history of contact with SARS patients could be found in 72.9% of 1,091 probale cases of SARS in the second survey. CONCLUSION Source of infection could be found through additional survey in part of probale cases of SARS without it in initial epidemiological survey.

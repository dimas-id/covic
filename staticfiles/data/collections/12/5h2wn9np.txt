In Felis catus whole foetus D cells infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), strain 79-1146, six virus-specific, poly(A)-containing RNA species of about 20, 9.6, 5.2, 3.8, 2.8 and 1.6 kb were found. By translation in vitro the 3.8 and 2.8 kb RNAs were shown to encode the 25K envelope protein and the 45K nucleocapsid protein, respectively. The partial map of the FIPV genome was compared with genomic maps of porcine, murine and avian coronaviruses. Differences in these maps suggest that transcription units have been lost or gained during coronavirus divergence.

A major difficulty in the analysis of propagation of the coronavirus is that many infected individuals show no symptoms of Covid-19. This implies a lack of information on the total counts of infected individuals and of recovered and immunized individuals. In this paper, we consider parametric time varying Markov processes of Coronavirus propagation and show how to estimate the model parameters and approximate the unobserved counts from daily numbers of infected and detected individuals and total daily death counts. This model-based approach is illustrated in an application to French data.

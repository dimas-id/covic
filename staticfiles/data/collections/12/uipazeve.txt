Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world, but there are wide variations in prevalence and mortality across nations. Genetic variants which influence behavioural or immune responses to pathogens, selected for by pathogen pressure, may influence this variability. Two relevant polymorphisms in this context are the s allele of the serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and the G allele of the interleukin-6 gene (IL-6 rs1800795). Methods: The frequencies of the 5-HTTLPR s allele and IL-6 rs1800795 G allele were obtained from published data. The correlations between these allele frequencies and the prevalence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were examined across 44 nations. Results: The IL-6 rs1800795 G allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence ({rho} = -0.466, p < 0.01) and mortality ({rho} = -0.591, p<0.001) across nations. The 5-HTTLPR s allele was negatively correlated with COVID-19 mortality rates ({rho} = -0.437, p = 0.023). Conclusions: These results suggest that a significant relationship exists between genetic variants that influence behavioural and immune responses to pathogens and indices of the impact of COVID-19 across nations. Further investigation of these variants and their correlates may permit the development of better preventive or therapeutic strategies in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Laparoscopy of abdominal wall defects becomes more and more actual, considering the well-known advantages of minimally invasive surgery, and the reduced incidence of post-operative ventral infections and recurrence rates compared to the the open repair with or without mesh. We hereby present the technique of the laparoscopic repair of small ventral hernias (defect 2 centimetres), using the Ventralex mesh, which is bi-faceted, polypropylene and PTFE, circular preformed, it has 8 centimeters in diameter, fixated with 4 transparietal sutures. The mesh is created for open surgery but it is placed in the intraperitoneal cavity. This technique was used for 28 patients,16 women and 12 men, with an average age of 53,3 years (29-72 years), consisting of: 22 umbilical hernias (UH), 2 epigastric hernias (EH), one left-side Spiegelian hernia, one incisional hernia after an open surgery for an umbilical hernia with a Ventralex mesh, and 2 trocar eventrations (TE) after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mean operating time was 52 minutes (42-70 minutes), post-operative hospital stay of 1,8 days (1-5 days). The main advantages are: circular preformed mesh, diameter of 8 centimeters, transfascial suture fixation, correct mesh placement and unfolding may be verified by laparoscopy, reduced costs. The technique is easy to reproduce.

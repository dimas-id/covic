Abstract Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea in pigs, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in sucking piglets. The TGEV membrane (M) protein is a decisive protein for the proliferation of viral proteins, and is associated with virus assembly and budding. To identify the cellular proteins that interact with the TGEV M protein, yeast two-hybrid screening was employed, and seven cellular proteins were identified M-binding partners. Using the GST pull-down approach and a CO-IP assay, the M protein was found to interact with porcine intestinal cells via eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-alpha (EIF4A2), an essential component of the cellular translational machinery. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed that EIF4A2 and M were colocalized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the function of EIF4A2 in intestinal cells during TGEV infection was examined. A knockdown of EIF4A2 by siRNA markedly decreased M protein proliferation and TGEV replication in target cells. Thus demonstrating that EIF4A2 plays a significant role in TGEV replication. The present study provides mechanistic insight into the interaction between the TGEV M protein and intestinal cells which contributes to the understanding of coronavirus replication and may be useful for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TGEV infection.

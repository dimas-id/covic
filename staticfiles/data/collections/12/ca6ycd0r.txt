This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize the lifestyle habits, anxiety levels and basic psychological needs (BPN), in Portuguese adults during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including a comparison between genders and age groups. In total, 1404 adults (36.4 ± 11.7 years; 69.6% female) answered sociodemographic data and three instruments: the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Basic Need General Satisfaction Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Males revealed higher values for the total energy expenditure (z = −2.26; p = 0.024; [Formula: see text] = 0.004) and for the level of satisfaction of competence (z = −2.62; p = 0.009; [Formula: see text] = 0.005). Females showed higher scores for the anxiety state (z = −7.87; p ≤ 0.001; [Formula: see text] = 0.044) and anxiety trait (z = −6.49; p ≤ 0.001; [Formula: see text] = 0.030). Regarding age, higher values for the anxiety trait (p ≤ 0.001; [Formula: see text] = 0.030) were found in the 18–34 years-old group compared to all the other age groups, also presenting significantly higher values of total energy expenditure (χ² = 13.93; p = 0.008; [Formula: see text] = 0.007) when compared to the 35–44 years-old group. Significant differences were observed between the 18–34 years-old group and the other age groups for the satisfaction of competence (χ² = 40.97; p ≤ 0.001; [Formula: see text] = 0.026), except for the >65 years-old group. Strategies for promoting well-being during periods of social isolation should consider the role of psychological dimensions and lifestyle habits according to the gender or age group.

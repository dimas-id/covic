Blood transfusion, using the safest conventional blood bioproducts, is an irreplaceable part of substitution therapy. It is considered the most essential supportive clinical intervention aimed to restore the health of patients in need. Nevertheless, numerous unresolved problems are still associated with current blood substitution therapy. To alleviate our dependency on blood donors, many investigators have been focusing on the quest for stem cell-derived blood cells in line with major developments in the field of regenerative medicine. The main objective is to provide a safe and highly standardized universal cultured red cell concentrate [CRBC] for all clinical applications, regardless of blood groups. Currently, we are close to overcoming some of the main obstacles in culturing cells. This concise report is a prelude to the immortalized cell lines that are ready for in vivo clinical trials. It is only through the sharing of experimental ideas and knowledge-based strategies that we will be able to achieve such an enormous task and better understand ‘’the one for all concept’’ of CRBCs and their universal usage in all clinical settings.

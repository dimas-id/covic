The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged existing healthcare systems and has made prevention of healthcare personnel exposure a high priority. Essential healthcare services, including multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings that make medical decisions, are expected to continue uninterrupted in this time of social distancing.

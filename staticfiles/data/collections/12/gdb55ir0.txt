The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes following sutureless ProGripâ„¢ mesh repair to traditional Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh secured with sutures. Data were collected prospectively and were analyzed for 57 male and 3 female patients with 60 inguinal hernias. All patients included underwent open surgical repair for inguinal hernia with polypropylene mesh or ProGrip mesh. In our two centres study sixty patients were operated; 30 were treated with Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh (L group) and 30 with ProGrip mesh (P group) with or without fixation. The primary parameter measured was intensity of postoperative pain using visual analogue scale (VAS); other outcomes included assessment of early and late complication. VAS was assessed in 7 days and 4 months of the postoperative period. Our results show that VAS scored at the 7th postoperative day was 1.5 for the ProGrip mesh versus 4.4 in Lichtenstein repair group. The difference between groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Surgery duration was significantly shorter in the P group (24.9 vs. 58.3 min; P=0.001). No recurrence was observed at 3 months in both groups. The 3-months follow-up has shown that time necessary to return to daily routine activity was significantly lower in the P group during the (P=0.001). Surgery duration, early and late postoperative, pain and return to daily routine activity rates were significantly reduced with self-gripping ProGrip mesh compared to Lichtenstein repair with polypropylene mesh.

Between January, 1974, and June, 1975, infection with a human reovirus-like agent was detected in 47% of 152 infants and children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. Certain epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory findings appear to be helpful in distinguishing gastroenteritis due to HRVLA from other causes in those children sick enough to require hospitalization. Age: 76% of infants and children seven through 12 months of age and 76% of those 13 through 24 months of age had infection with the HRVLA, whereas such infection was found in only 21% of infants under six months of age and 23% of children 25 through 60 months of age. Time of Year: 61% of patients studied during the cooler months had HRVLA infection and such infection was not found from June to October. Frequency of vomiting and dehydration: Twice as many patients infected with HRVLA as those who were not had vomiting (92%) and significant dehydration (83%).

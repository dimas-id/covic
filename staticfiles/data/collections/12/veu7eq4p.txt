Previous studies have shown that subunits E (eIF3e), F (eIF3f) and H (elF3h) of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 play important roles in cell development in humans and yeast. eIF3e and eIF3h have also been reported to be important for normal cell growth in Arabidopsis. However, the functions of subunit eIF3f remain largely unknown in plant species. Here we report characterization of mutants for the Arabidopsis eIF3f (AteIF3f) gene. AteIF3f encodes a protein that is highly expressed in pollen grains, developing embryos and root tips, and interacts with Arabidopsis eIF3e and eIF3h proteins. A Ds insertional mutation in AteIF3f disrupted pollen germination and embryo development. Expression of some of the genes that are essential for pollen tube growth and embryogenesis is down‐regulated in ateif3f‐1 homozygous seedlings obtained by pollen rescue. These results suggested that AteIF3f might play important roles in Arabidopsis cell growth and differentiation in combination with eIF3e and eIF3h.

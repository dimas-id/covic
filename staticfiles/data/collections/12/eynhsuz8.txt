In this precarious time of staying at home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, people often ask around what movies are worth watching. I recommend the movie, The Post, directed by Steven Spielberg in 2017. In this review, I am going to provide a rationale for why I keep returning to the movie: it gave me opportunities to ponder what it means to be a token woman leader who began as a housewife and became a transformational leader in U.S. history. I present here select notable scenes that are memorable and inspiring. To that end, I capture the scenes first and then add my own reviews from the lens of women's leadership. My conclusion: we need to hear more transformational women leaders' voices that will help inspire women in the next generation.

Liver fibrosis is the hepatic response to an insult characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. If the underlying cause is not treated or eliminated, the disease can progress and may lead to several clinical complications including hepatocellular carcinoma or even death. Thus, detection, staging, and follow-up of liver fibrosis are the main issues in the prognosis and treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. In recent years, new advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics technology and protein fractionation techniques have improved protein identification as well as protein quantification in many different samples and diseases including liver fibrosis. In particular, the fibrinogen α chain and more specifically the serum levels of the 5.9 kDa fragment of fibrinogen α C-chain have shown to be altered in several hepatic etiologies. In fact, these results have been reproduced by different laboratories, and recently a marked downregulation of this protein fragment has also been described in the initial stages of liver fibrosis. In this chapter, we have described the potential role of fibrinogen α chain and particularly the 5.9 kDa fragment of fibrinogen α C-chain as a circulating marker of liver fibrosis.

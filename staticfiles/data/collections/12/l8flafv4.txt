The COVID-19 pandemic has had major negative health, psychological, social and economic repercussions for individuals, families, communities, countries and for humanity in general. The interrelation with age and the presence of chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking) seems to go further than what would be explained by the prevalence and distribution of both. The drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are in many cases the backbone for the management of these diseases, it has been known for a long time that these drugs significantly increase the expression of receptors for angiotensin conversion enzyme type 2 in the lung tissue. This fact, together with the knowledge that the route of entry of the virus into the cell is precisely the ACE-2 receptor, initiated a hypothesis, based on very low-quality evidence, which quickly became generalized in the media, that the use of these drugs could be negative and that they should be interrupted immediately. The response of practically all Scientific Societies was almost immediate, with the precise indication that treatment with these drugs should not be discontinued, since the evidence of their usefulness is based on very solid and high-quality evidence. Simultaneously, a different hypothesis also appeared, also based on very preliminary evidence, that these drugs are not only harmful but also beneficial, however these medicaments are not yet accepted as agents for the prevention or treatment of this disease or its complications. This review reports current knowledge on the relationship between COVID-19 and SRAA.

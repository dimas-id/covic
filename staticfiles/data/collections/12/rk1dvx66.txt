Objectives We aimed to identify occupational groups at high risk of COVID-19 infection, estimate the number of such workers, and examine the prevalence of protective resources by employment status in Korea. Methods Based on the 6th Standard Occupational Classification codes, the 2015 census data was linked with the 5th Korean Working Conditions Survey data, which measures how frequently workers directly contact with people other than fellow employees in the workplace. Results A total of 30 occupational groups, including seven occupations from healthcare and welfare sectors and 23 from other sectors, are classified as high-risk occupational groups to have frequent contact with people other than fellow employees in the workplace (more than half of the working hours). Approximately 1.4 million (women, 79.1%) and 10.7 million workers (46.3%) are employed respectively in the high-risk occupations of healthcare and welfare and other sectors. Occupations with a larger share of women are more likely to be at higher risk of infection and paid less. Among the wage-earners in the high-risk occupations, protective resources to deal with COVID-19 such as trade union and health and safety committee are less prevalent in temporary or daily workers than those in permanent employment. Conclusion Given the large number of Korean workforces employed in high-risk occupations and inequality within the working population, the workplace needs to be the key locus for the governments' action to control the COVID-19, and special consideration for vulnerable workers should be warranted.

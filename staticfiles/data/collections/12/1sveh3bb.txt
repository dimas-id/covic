Omental lipoblastoma is extremely rare among benign tumors. We herein report the case of a child who underwent laparoscopic extirpation of a large omental lipoblastoma. A 4-year-old girl was diagnosed with an intra-abdominal solid tumor. Abdominal imaging revealed a fat density mass that was well encapsulated and measured 18 × 15 × 7.5 cm in size. Considering the MRI findings and movability of the tumor, we strongly suspected that the lesion was an omental lipoblastoma. We initially decided to perform laparoscopic exploration and, if possible, extirpation of the solid tumor sequentially. A total of five trocars were used, and the tumor was found to originate from the omentum. We successfully performed complete resection of the tumor laparoscopically. A histological examination revealed lipoblastoma. For large abdominal tumors in children, the laparoscopic approach is recommended as the first procedure when the tumor is preoperatively considered to be benign and resectable.

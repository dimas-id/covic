BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a widespread used procedure for treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients. In this study, the adaptation of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery approach to primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients necessitating surgical treatment, with its pros and cons over the traditional two- or three-port approaches are examined. METHODS Between January 2011 and August 2013, 146 primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients suitable for surgical treatment are evaluated prospectively. Indications for surgery included prolonged air leak, recurrent pneumothorax, or abnormal findings on radiological examinations. Visual analog scale and patient satisfaction scale score were utilized. RESULTS Forty triple-port, 69 double-port, and 37 single-port operations were performed. Mean age of 146 (126 male, 20 female) patients was 27.1 ± 16.4 (range 15-42). Mean operation duration was 63.59 ± 26 min; 61.7 for single, 64.2 for double, and 63.8 min for triple-port approaches. Total drainage was lower in the single-port group than the multi-port groups (P = 0.001). No conversion to open thoracotomy or 30-day hospital mortality was seen in our group. No recurrence was seen in single-port group on follow-up period. Visual analog scale scores on postoperative 24th, 48th, and 72nd hours were 3.42 ± 0.94, 2.46 ± 0.81, 1.96 ± 0.59 in the single-port group; significantly lower than the other groups (P = 0.011, P = 0.014, and P = 0.042, respectively). Patient satisfaction scale scores of patients in the single-port group on 24th and 48th hours were 1.90 ± 0.71 and 2.36 ± 0.62, respectively, indicating a significantly better score than the other two groups (P = 0.038 and P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS This study confirms the competency of single-port procedure in first-line surgical treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Infectious diseases of farm animals are one of the major threats to agriculture and can cause considerable damage at local, regional, and even at the international level both in industrialized and in developing countries. In the last two centuries considerable efforts have been invested in understanding the causes and pathogenesis of viral and bacterial diseases of domestic animals. These studies have introduced new methodologies for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of veterinary diseases. Importantly, research on veterinary pathogens also had a major impact in understanding basic biological processes of viruses and bacteria. In some cases, studies on veterinary pathogens have revolutionized biology and established entire new disciplines. This article will furnish a historical perspective on how studies of animal diseases, focusing on viral diseases in particular, have made a major contribution on the current understanding of pathogen biology. In addition, the main features of some of the most important viral diseases of farm animals will be described. Climate and environmental changes can favor the emergence of new pathogens or the reemergence of old ones. It is critical that resources be devoted to research and surveillance of veterinary pathogens in order to preserve and improve both animal and human health.

BACKGROUND This retrospective study evaluated long-term weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, quality of life (QoL), and food tolerance after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS Between January 2003 and July 2008, 102 patients underwent LSG as a sole bariatric operation. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed. Demographics, complications, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were determined. Quality of life was measured using Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36) and Bariatric Analysis and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS) questionnaires, which were sent to all patients. The food tolerance score (FTS) was determined and compared with that of nonobese subjects. RESULTS A total of 83 patients (81.4%) were eligible for follow-up evaluation. Their mean initial body mass index (BMI) was 39.3 kg/m(2). No major complications occurred. At a median follow-up point of 49 months (range, 17-80 months), the mean %EWL was 72.3% ± 29.3%. For the 23 patients who reached the 6-year follow-up point, the mean %EWL was 55.9% ± 25.55%. The mean BAROS score was 6.5 ± 2.1, and a "good" to "excellent" score was observed for 75 patients (90.4%). In the comparison of patients with a %EWL greater than 50% and those with a %EWL of 50% or less, the SF-36 scores were statistically different only for "physical functioning" and "general health perception." The mean FTS was 23.8, and 95.2% of the patients described their food tolerance as acceptable to excellent. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure, although a tendency for weight regain is noted after 5 years of follow-up evaluation. Resolution of comorbidity is comparable with that reported in the literature. The LSG procedure results in good to excellent health-related QoL. Food tolerance is lower for patients after LSG than for nonobese patients who had no surgery, but 95.2% described food tolerance as acceptable to excellent.

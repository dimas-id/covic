AIM: This aim of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 in neonates and children under one year of age. METHODS: A systematic literature review of the MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and EBSCO databases was carried out for studies from 1 January to 7 April 2020. We included all papers that addressed clinical manifestations, laboratory results, imaging findings and outcomes in infants and neonates. RESULTS: Our search identified 77 peer‐reviewed papers and 18 papers covering 160 infants were reviewed. One paper was from Vietnam and the other 17 were from China: eight were cross‐sectional studies, eight were case reports, one was a case series and one was a prospective cohort study. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (54%) and cough (33%). Most infants were treated symptomatically, with frequent use of various empirical medications. Infants and neonates tended to have more severe COVID‐19 disease than older children: 11 (7%) were admitted to intensive care and one infant died. The mortality rate was 0.006%, with favourable outcomes in most cases. CONCLUSION: Infants and neonates were more vulnerable to more severe COVID‐19 disease than older children, but morbidity and mortality were low.

OBJECTIVE This study presents short-term outcomes related to changes in existing and de novo lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), pelvic pain, and bowel function following robot-assisted laparoscopic uterosacral ligament suspension (RALUSLS) and sacrocolpopexy (RALSC). METHODS Observational data for RALUSLS (n = 23) and RALSC (n = 25) collected between August 2014 and March 2016 from a single institute (The University of Texas Medical Branch) were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics, concomitant procedures, and the occurrence of lower urinary tract, pelvic pain, and bowel symptoms were compared between patients undergoing RALUSLS and RALSC. RESULTS There was no significant difference in background characteristics between the 2 groups, except for parity, which was high in the RALUSLS group. In the RALUSLS group, patients experienced significant resolution of urinary urgency (P < .001) and frequency, urge and mixed incontinence, and pelvic pain (P < .05). In the RALSC group, there was significant resolution of nocturia, mixed incontinence, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia (P < .05). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of de novo symptoms in the RALUSLS and RALSC groups (P > .05), although newly appearing urinary urgency or frequency and stress or urge incontinence were more common after RALSC. CONCLUSION Mixed incontinence and pelvic pain improved significantly in patients after RALUSLS or RALSC. In RALUSLS patients, urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence also improved, whereas additional improvement in nocturia and dyspareunia was evident only in RALSC patients. De novo LUTS developing after these procedures, especially after RALSC, necessitate careful patient consultation prior to surgery.

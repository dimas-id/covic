A cross-sectional study was conducted to isolate and identify bacterial species from the respiratory tract of apparently healthy and pneumonic camels in Asayita and Dubti woredas in the Afar Region, Ethiopia. From a total of 74 lung tissue and 74 tracheal swab samples Staphylococcus aureus, 16.3%, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, 13.0%, and Pasteurella multocida, 10.9%, were dominant isolates from pneumonic lungs; Escherichia coli, 12.7%, Proteus species, 10.9%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9.1%, were the majority in the normal lungs. The majority of the isolates colonized both anatomical sites investigated. There was a statistically significant association between the health status of the camels as well as the anatomical site studied with the isolation rates of the major respiratory pathogens (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the isolates were susceptible to norfloxacin, streptomycin, and gentamicin but resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline on in vitro test. Further studies on the pathogenicity of the major isolates are recommended.

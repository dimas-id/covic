SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus resulting in the present COVID-19 pandemic, has increased the otolaryngologist's reliance on telemedicine to manage outpatient pathology. The nature of telemedicine, however, limits a provider's ability to obtain a comprehensive physical examination, specifically of the tympanic membrane. Various smartphone-based otoscopic attachments are now available that facilitate patient-obtained otoscopic image capture of the tympanic membrane. Here, we present 3 cases in which a patient-purchased, over-the-counter otoscope was utilized to alter otologic management during the time of social distancing. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding the safety and efficacy of patient-based "at-home" otoscopic examination and to optimize the use of these devices.

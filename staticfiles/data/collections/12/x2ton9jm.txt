BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, the appropriate reperfusion strategy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unclear. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study consecutively enrolled patients who presented with STEMI and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) during the outbreak of COVID- 19. Due to the delay in the reporting of the PCR test results, our postprocedural triage regarding COVID-19, followed by the isolation strategy, was based on lung CT scan results. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with STEMI referred to our center. PPCI was done for 44 (91%) of these patients. The mean symptom-to-device time was 490.93 ± 454.608 minutes, and the mean FMC-to-device time was and 154.12 ± 36.27 minutes. Nine (18%) patients with STEMI were diagnosed as having typical/indeterminate features indicating COVID-19 involvement. During hospitalization, 1 (2.0%) patient died of cardiogenic shock. The study population was followed for 35.9 ± 12.7 days. Two patients expired in another centers due to COVID-19. No CCL staff members were infected by COVID-19 during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Our small report indicates that by taking the recommended safety measures and using appropriate PPE, we can continue PPCI as the main reperfusion strategy safely and effectively.

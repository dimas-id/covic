In December 2019, many pneumonia cases were reported without an appar-ent cause but were associated with seafood and wet markets in Wuhan, China Clinical features were similar to pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2 (formerly 2019-nCoV) was determined as the causative pathogen. To date, there are no effective antiviral drugs for the targeted treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We provide the VITYALA YETHINDRA (VYTR) hypothesis for the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of GS-5734 treatment in humans with COVID-19. Prophylactic GS-5734 treatment may prevent SARS-CoV-2 induced disease and lung lesions in participants inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Therapeutic GS-5734 treatment may show a reduction in the severity of symptoms, reduce viral repli-cation, the complete eradication of lung lesions in some participants and decrease in the extent of lesions in 50% of participants may be possible. As broad-spectrum drugs are capable of inhibiting coronavirus infections, GS-5734 should be considered a broad-spectrum, first-line drug and may inhibit coronavirus infections and COVID-19. More clinical trials are needed to prove that GS-5734 (Remdesivir) is a safe and effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19.

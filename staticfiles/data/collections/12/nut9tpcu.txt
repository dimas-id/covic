PURPOSE Exfoliated malignant cells, present along staple lines of anastomosis, may be responsible for anastomotic recurrence of colon cancer. We aimed to assess the impact of surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor and intraluminal lavage on the presence of exfoliated malignant cells at anastomosis sites in patients with colon cancer. METHODS In this prospective study, 32 patients with colon cancer, requiring right hemicolectomy between January 2007 and September 2008, were randomly assigned to a control group (no surgical bowel occlusion; 18 patients) and a "no-touch" group that underwent surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor before tumor manipulation (14 patients). The fluid used intraoperatively to irrigate the portion of the bowel clamped distal to the tumor was examined cytologically, and exfoliated cells of cytological classes IV and V were considered malignant. RESULTS In the control group, 2 (11.1%) and 10 (55.6%) of 18 patients had exfoliated malignant cells at the terminal ileum and distal colon anastomosis sites, respectively; however, only 1 (7.1%) of the 14 patients in the no-touch group had exfoliated malignant cells at both the sites. The frequency of exfoliated malignant cells at the distal colon anastomosis site was significantly lower in the no-touch group (p = 0.0024). No exfoliated malignant cells were found upon saline irrigation of 400 ml or more in either group. CONCLUSION Measures, such as surgical bowel occlusion around the tumor and intraluminal lavage, can prevent or eliminate exfoliated malignant cells at anastomotic sites in patients with colon cancer.

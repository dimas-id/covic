Let [Formula: see text] be a set of size 4 such that [Formula: see text] cannot be obtained by applying the same affine function to all of the elements of [Formula: see text]. We show that there is an infinite sequence of elements of [Formula: see text] that contains no three consecutive blocks of same size and same sum (additive cubes). Moreover, it is possible to replace [Formula: see text] by [Formula: see text] in the statement.

Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) represent less than 1% of all intracranial aneurysms, and occur mostly in association with temporal bone fractures following head trauma. Given the unknown natural history, it is unclear whether they should be treated. We present two cases of MMA pseudoaneurysms discovered during trauma workups. The first patient is a 44-year-old male with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) following a motor vehicle accident. The patient was found to have two right-sided middle meningeal artery pseudoaneurysms that were treated successfully with OnyxÂ® (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) embolization. The second patient is a 56-year-old male that sustained a severe TBI and skull fracture following a motorcycle collision. Angiography demonstrated an unruptured right MMA aneurysm, which was also treated successfully with Onyx embolization. MMA pseudoaneurysms occur rarely in the setting of severe traumatic injuries. In select patients, treatment by an experienced neuro-interventionalist can prevent highly morbid future intracranial hemorrhages with minimal risk of complications.

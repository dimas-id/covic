At our institute, a non-suturing method for closure of the umbilical epidermis has been used in laparoscopic colorectal resection to prevent umbilical wound infection. We performed a retrospective evaluation of the incidence of umbilical wound infection using this technique for patients with colorectal cancer. From 2010 to 2014, 178 consecutive patients underwent elective laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer. The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted multifilament absorbable sutures. The skin surface of the umbilicus was compressed using a cotton ball and sealed by water vapor-permeable film. Three (1.7 %) patients required conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery. The mean surgery time was 174 ± 48 min, intraoperative blood loss was 29 ± 75 mL, and postoperative hospital stay was 10.5 ± 6.7 days. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, umbilical superficial wound infection occurred in two (1.1 %) patients. The two patients recovered from their wound infections after a few days of drainage, and their hospital discharge was not delayed. Deep umbilical wound infection did not occur in any patient. Our non-suturing closure technique appeared to be effective in preventing wound infection after laparoscopic resection of colon cancer.

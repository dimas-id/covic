Posterior condylar canal dural arteriovenous fistula (PCC dAVF) is a rare entity with only three cases having been reported so far in the English literature. We describe the clinical presentation, imaging, and endovascular management of an elderly man with left PCC dAVF presenting with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Endovascular management of such cases requires thorough understanding of the vascular anatomy around the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) and variable bridging vein draining patterns. The fistula in our case was fed by the posterior meningeal branch of the left vertebral artery and was draining through a dilated and tortuous medullary bridging vein into the antero-lateral pontomedullary venous system. Transarterial glue embolisation was performed with complete exclusion of the fistula and venous pouches. The patient developed intractable hiccough and left-sided facial pain on the second post-procedural day, and MRI showed focal diffusion restriction in the left dorso-lateral medulla. He recovered completely after a short course of steroids.

Although extraperitoneal colostomy is often performed to prevent postoperative parastomal hernia formation following an open abdominoperineal resection of lower rectal cancer, it has not been widely employed laparoscopically because of the difficulty associated with the extraperitoneal route. This paper describes a laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy using the Endo Retractâ„¢ Maxi instrument. This surgical technique is easy, and helps to prevent the development of parastomal hernias.

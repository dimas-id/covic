Critical care transport organizations are nimble, operationally focused institutions that can aid in managing crises. Ornge provides air ambulance and critical care transport services to Ontario. From 12 bases, Ornge operates four PC-12 Next Generation fixed wing (FW) aircraft, eight AW-139 rotary wing (RW) aircraft, and four critical care land ambulances (CCLA) on a 24/7 basis. Ornge also contracts with private air carriers to provide lower acuity air ambulance services. Ornge performs over 20,000 patient-related transports annually. We discuss Ornge's approach to preparing for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and identify potential unconventional roles.

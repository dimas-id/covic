AIM To study and describe patients who underwent treatment for gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) with different endoscopic treatment modalities. METHODS We reviewed patients with GAVE who underwent treatment at University of Alabama at Birmingham between March 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016. Included patients had an endoscopic diagnosis of GAVE with associated upper gastrointestinal bleeding or iron deficiency anemia. RESULTS Seven out of 15 patients had classic watermelon description for GAVE, 1/15 with diffuse/honeycomb pattern and 6/15 with nodular GAVE per EGD description. Seven out of 15 patients required multimodal treatment. Four out of six of patients with endoscopically nodular GAVE required multimodal therapy. Overall, mean pre- and post-treatment hemoglobin (Hb) values were 8.2 ± 0.8 g/dL and 9.7 ± 1.6 g/dL, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Mean number of packed red blood cells transfusions before and after treatment was 3.8 ± 4.3 and 1.2 ± 1.7 (P ≤ 0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION Patients with nodular variant GAVE required multimodal approach more frequently than non-nodular variants. Patients responded well to multimodal therapy and saw decrease in transfusion rates and increase in Hb concentrations. Our findings suggest a multimodal approach may be beneficial in nodular variant GAVE.

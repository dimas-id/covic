The worldwide CoVid-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented push across the whole of the scientific community to develop a potent antiviral drug and vaccine as soon as possible. Existing academic, governmental and industrial institutions and companies have engaged in large-scale screening of existing drugs, in vitro, in vivo and in silico. Here, we are using in silico modelling of SARS-CoV-2 drug targets, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 protein structures as deposited on the Protein Databank (PDB). We study their flexibility, rigidity and mobility, an important first step in trying to ascertain their dynamics for further drug-related docking studies. We are using a recent protein flexibility modelling approach, combining protein structural rigidity with possible motion consistent with chemical bonds and sterics. For example, for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the open configuration, our method identifies a possible further opening and closing of the S1 subunit through movement of SB domain. With full structural information of this process available, docking studies with possible drug structures are then possible in silico. In our study, we present full results for the more than 200 thus far published SARS-CoV-2-related protein structures in the PDB.

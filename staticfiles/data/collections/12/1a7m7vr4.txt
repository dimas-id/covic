The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of early mortality and identify risk factors for early death following modern uncemented THA. Between 2000 and 2006, we identified patients who died within 90days of THA. Demographics, comorbidities, laboratory studies, and complications were analyzed as risk factors for mortality. 38 of 8261 patients undergoing THA (0.46%) died within 90days postoperatively. Of these, 26% were due to myocardial infarction. Multivariate analysis revealed Charlson index >3, peripheral vascular disease, elevated postoperative glucose, and abnormal postoperative cardiac studies as independent predictors of early mortality following THA. Caution should be taken in patients with increased comorbidities, PVD, perioperative hyperglycemia, and impaired renal function in order to reduce mortality following THA.

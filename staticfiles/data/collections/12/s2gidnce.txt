Optimal control problems reflecting the finding of effective quarantine strategies are considered for two control SEIR~type models describing the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the human population. The properties of the corresponding optimal controls are established analytically by applying the Pontryagin maximum principle. The optimal solutions are obtained numerically using BOCOP 2.0.5 software. The behavior of the appropriate optimal solutions and their dependence on the basic reproductive ratio and length of quarantine are discussed in detail. Necessary conclusions are made.

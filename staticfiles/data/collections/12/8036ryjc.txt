BACKGROUND Laparoscopic One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (LOAGB) is one of the main bariatric procedures that require a safe and reproducible gastrojejunal anastomosis. Barbed suture has been widely used for surgery in recent years; however, few studies have reported their use for gastro-intestinal anastomosis. We proposed their use for totally hand-sewn anastomosis during LOAGB. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of leaks and stenosis after a hand-sewn anastomosis using an absorbable bidirectional monofilament barbed suture: Stratafix®. SETTING The study was done in a private practice setting. METHODS Between April and November 2014, 50 consecutive patients undergoing a hand-sewn antecolic, antegastric gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA) using Stratafix®. Pre, intra, and postoperative parameters were assessed for these patients. RESULTS No fistulas or anastomotic stenosis had occurred up to 6 months after surgery. All procedures were completed laparoscopically, and no intraoperative complications occurred. The mean length of hospital stay was 3 days. CONCLUSION The use of an absorbable bidirectional monofilament barbed suture for the GJA was safe. Further prospective studies with a higher number of patients are needed to address the safety and efficacy of the absorbable bidirectional monofilament barbed suture in bariatric surgery.

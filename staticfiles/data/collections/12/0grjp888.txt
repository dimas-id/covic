Intracranial circumferential fusiform aneurysms of the posterior circulation involving arterial branches or perforating vessels are difficult to treat. This article shows an endovascular reconstruction technique not yet described, using a telescoping self-expandable stent (LEO+) and flow-diverter device (SILK) at different surgical times. Two patients with circumferential fusiform aneurysm, one being an aneurysm of the segments P2 and P3 of the posterior cerebral artery, diagnosed after a headache, and the other a partially thrombosed aneurysm of the lower basilar artery, diagnosed following ischemia of the brain stem. Endovascular treatment was performed by means of a vascular reconstruction technique that used at different surgical times: overlapping; a telescoped self-expandable stent, LEO+; and a flow-diverter device, SILK. Angiographic control was carried out at 6 and 12 months, to evaluate arterial patency, flow maintenance in the arterial branches and perforating vessels, and thrombosis of the aneurysm. The combined use at different surgical times of the self-expandable stent and flow-diverter device was technically successful in both patients. There were no complications during the procedure, nor in the long-term follow-up with full arterial vascular reconstruction, maintenance of cerebral perfusion and complete aneurysm occlusion at the 6- and 12-month angiographic follow-up. There was no aneurysm recanalization nor intra-stent stenosis. Circumferential fusiform aneurysm of the posterior circulation involving arterial branches or perforating vessels to the brain stem may be treated with this arterial reconstruction technique at different surgical times, using the self-expandable stent called LEO+ and the flow-diverter device SILK, minimizing the risk of complications and failure of the endovascular technique, with the potential for arterial reconstruction with thrombosis of the aneurysmatic sac, as well as flow maintenance in the eloquent arteries, in this type of cerebral aneurysm.

The possibility of recording the results of serologic reactions not yielding visible phenomena by means of light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) was studied. Influenza virus andMycoplasma pneumoniae antigens and the corresponding antisera were used as the test objects. It was shown that, in principle, LSS can be used to detect the antigen-antibody complex in serologic reactions not yielding viible phenomena.

Truncated human coronavirus HCoV-229E spike glycoproteins containing amino acids 407 to 547 bound to purified, soluble virus receptor, human aminopeptidase N (hAPN). Soluble hAPN neutralized the infectivity of HCoV-229E virions at 37 degrees C, but not 4 degrees C. Binding of hAPN may therefore trigger conformational changes in the viral spike protein at 37 degrees C that facilitate virus entry.

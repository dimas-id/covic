Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a major family of foodborne pathogens of public health, zoonotic, and economic significance in the United States and worldwide. To date, there are no published reports on use of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for STEC detection. The primary goal of this study was to assess the potential application of RPA in detection of STEC. This study focused on designing and evaluating RPA primers and fluorescent probes for isothermal (39°C) detection of STEC. Compatible sets of candidate primers and probes were designed for detection of Shiga toxin 1 and 2 (Stx1 and 2), respectively. The sets were evaluated for specificity and sensitivity against STEC (n=12) of various stx genotypes (stx1/stx2, stx1, or stx2, respectively), including non-Stx-producing E. coli (n=28) and other genera (n=7). The primers and probes that were designed targeted amplification of the subunit A moiety of stx1 and stx2. The assay detected STEC in real time (within 5-10 min at 39°C) with high sensitivity (93.5% vs. 90%; stx1 vs. stx2), specificity (99.1% vs. 100%; stx1 vs. stx2), and predictive value (97.9% for both stx1 vs. stx2). Limits of detection of ∼ 5-50 colony-forming units/mL were achieved in serially diluted cultures grown in brain heart infusion broth. This study successfully demonstrated for the first time that RPA can be used for isothermal real-time detection of STEC.

Abstract Introduction The monitoring system based on standards of quality allows clinicians to evaluate and improve the patient's care. According to the quality indicators recommended by Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva Crítica y Unidades Coronarias, and due to the importance of prone position (PP) as a treatment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is fundamental to keep accurate record of serious adverse events occurring during the prone position procedure and its posterior analysis. Objectives To establish fulfilment of the Sociedad Española de Medicina Intensiva Crítica y Unidades Coronarias standards of quality according to the register of serious complications. To identify the incidence of serious complications registered as well as to identify possible factors related to these complications. Method Retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study, polyvalent ICU (16 beds). Study population Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with PP (January 2012–December 2013). Study variables PP recording, accidental extubation, removal of catheters, decubitus ulcers (DU), ETT obstruction, urgency of the procedure, hours in PP, nutritional intake, type of feeding tube, food regurgitation/retention and use of prokinetics/muscle relaxant. Results The study sample comprised 38 cases, with an adequate record of complications in 92.1% of the cases. DU were the only serious complication recorded, with a 25.7% incidence. Possible factors related to DU: more hours in PP in patients developing DU (p =0.067). Less incidence of DU in well-nourished patients (p =0.577). 82.9% of patients were not appropriately nourished. Conclusions The percentage of records duly completed is very high. The presence of DU (grade 1–2 mostly) is to be noted. There is no statistical significance, although a trend is obsersed, between DU and hours in PP.

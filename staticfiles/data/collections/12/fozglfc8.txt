A novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading globally, causing severe pneumonia and acute lung injury in many patients. Even worse, severe respiratory may develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in COVID-19. The cytokine storm caused by immune over-activation due to virus infection may be an important cause of death in the late period of progress, but the pathogenesis of cytokine storm is still unclear. This article reviews the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm in detail based on the current discovered researches, and put forward some valuable medication ideas for the targeted cytokines drug researches and treatment. The goal of this work will be helpful for reducing excessive immune response.

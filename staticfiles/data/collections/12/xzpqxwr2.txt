Background: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global threat Few studies have explored the risk factors for the recovery time of patients with COVID-19 This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in a hospital in Wuhan by March 30, 2020, were included Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data from COVID-19 patients on hospital admission were extracted and were compared between the two groups, defined as short- and long-term hospitalization, respectively according to the median hospitalization time Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were performed to identify risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 Results: A total of 125 discharged patients with COVID-19 were reviewed, including 123 general patients and two severe patients The median hospitalization time was 13 0 days (IQR 10 0-17 0) Among them, 66 patients were discharged &lt;14 days (short-term group) and 59 patients were discharged â‰¥14 days (long-term group) Compared with the short-term group, patients in the long-term group had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (P = 0 000), troponin I (P = 0 002), myoglobin (P = 0 037), aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0 005), lactic dehydrogenase (P = 0 000), prothrombin time (P = 0 030), fibrinogen (P = 0 000), and D-dimer (P = 0 006), but had significantly lower levels of lymphocyte count (P = 0 001), platelet count (P = 0 017), albumin (P = 0 001), and calcium (P = 0 000) Additionally, the incidences of hypocalcemia (P = 0 001), hyponatremia (P = 0 021), hypochloremia (P = 0 019), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0 000) in the long-term group were significantly higher than those in the short-term group Multivariable regression showed that hypocalcemia (P = 0 007, OR 3 313, 95% CI 1 392-7 886), hypochloremia (P = 0 029, OR 2 663, 95% CI 1 104-6 621), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0 009, OR 5 907, 95% CI 1 073-32 521) were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 Furthermore, a ROC curve where the area under the ROC was 0 766 for retained variables is presented Conclusions: Hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and bilateral pneumonia on hospital admission were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the importance of electrolyte imbalance in predicting the hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19

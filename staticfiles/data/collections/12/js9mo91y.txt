Only a few reports describe chest wall reconstruction after sternal resection using Gore-Tex dual mesh, and very few reports describe the use of a vascularized rib to support the thoracic cage. We present a case of a breast cancer patient who underwent anterior chest wall resection for recurrent sternal cancer. Her sternoclavicular joints bilaterally and lower sternum were divided using an electric saw. The bony chest wall was reconstructed using Gore-Tex dual mesh, and a vascularized rib was used to bridge the space between the clavicular heads to support the thoracic cage. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, without complications, such as paradoxical respiration or pneumonia.

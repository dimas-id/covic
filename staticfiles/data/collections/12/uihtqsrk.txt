Very high mortality rates of coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) are observed around the world due to lack of medical equipment. The increased need for medical devices and personal protective equipment (PPE) has kept several healthcare professionals at risk. Fortunately, 3D printing technology allows to overcome the lack of medical supplies. This study highlights the impact of 3D printing on the combat against COVID19, and its importance in the medical product supply chain. Indeed, the existing medical equipment fabricated by 3D printing technology and its role in the management of Covid19 pandemic is presented. Moreover, the last works are examined to know whether the models of the medical equipment are free of use and whether useful informations are presented (eg, available design data and setup guidelines).

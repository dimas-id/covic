The distribution of phosphatidylcholine between inner and outer monolayers of rat brain synaptic plasma membrane was investigated by means of a phosphatidylcholine specific exchange protein. About 70% of the total membranal phosphatidylcholine was in the outer leaflet, 33% of which was exposed and readily exchanged in intact synaptosomes while the remainder was exchangeable following osmotic shock. Permeabilization of the synaptic plasma membranes by overnight incubation in buffer or by saponin (<0.08%) exposed an additional 30% of phosphatidylcholine to exchange, presumably from the inner cytoplasmic leaflet. Phosphatidylcholine is therefore asymmetrically distributed in the synaptosomal plasma membrane, as it is in other plasma membranes.

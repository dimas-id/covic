Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in children mainly shows a milder course. In complicated cases, it is unknown whether inflammation is predictive of disease severity, as in adults. Moreover, cardiac involvement is anecdotally described. We report the case of a 2-month-old infant with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection presenting with fever, tachycardia and elevated interleukin-6, who was diagnosed with myocarditis and treated with immunoglobulins.

PURPOSE In theory, a slow oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]) kinetics leads to a greater accumulation of anaerobic by-products, which can, in turn, induce more neuromuscular fatigue. However, the existence of this relationship has never been tested. METHODS After two sessions to measure peak [Formula: see text], peak power output (POpeak), and [Formula: see text] kinetics responses in the unfatigued state (τ [Formula: see text] MOD), 10 healthy young adults performed a 6-min cycling bout at 80% POpeak (INT6-min). [Formula: see text] kinetics responses were also measured during INT6-min. Neuromuscular fatigue was measured isometrically pre- and post-INT6-min (immediately post- and 15-s post-INT6-min) with an innovative cycle ergometer. RESULTS Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force, high-frequency doublet amplitude, and the ratio of low- to high-frequency doublet amplitudes decreased by 34 ± 7, 43 ± 11, and 31 ± 13%, respectively (all P < 0.01). A significant Spearman's rank correlation was observed between the change in low-frequency doublet force (ΔDb10) immediately after INT6-min and both τ [Formula: see text] MOD and τ [Formula: see text] INT6-min (ρ = -0.68 and ρ = -0.67, both P < 0.05). When considering the largest responses from the two neuromuscular evaluations post-INT6-min, significant correlations were also found between τ [Formula: see text] MOD and ΔDb10 (ρ = -0.74; P < 0.05) and between τ[Formula: see text] INT6-min and both ΔDb10 and low-frequency fatigue (ρ = -0.70 and ρ = -0.66; both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The present results suggest that subjects with slow [Formula: see text] kinetics experience more peripheral fatigue, in particular more excitation-contraction coupling failure, likely due to a greater accumulation of protons and/or inorganic phosphates.

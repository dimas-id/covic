The full-length genome sequence of a novel swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), CH/FJWT/2018, was determined, which was genetically most closely related to CN/GDWT/2017, recently discovered in Fujian, China. The indel sites of the spike (S) gene of CH/FJWT/2018 were most similar to those of bat-origin SADS-related coronaviruses.

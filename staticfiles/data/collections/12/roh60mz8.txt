INTRODUCTION Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) uses a multiple-entry portal in a single 3.0- to 4.0-cm incision in a natural scar, the umbilicus. The present study aimed to compare the inflammatory impact of classic video laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) versus LESS cholecystectomy. METHODS A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted from January to June 2011 at 2 university hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fifty-seven patients (53 women, 4 men; mean age = 48.7 years) were randomly assigned to receive LC (n = 29) or LESS (n = 28) cholecystectomy. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured from blood samples collected during induction of anesthesia and at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. RESULTS Median IL-6 levels in the LESS and LC groups, respectively, were 2.96 and 4.5 pg/mL preoperatively, 11.6 and 28.05 pg/mL at 3 hours postoperatively (P = .029), and 13.18 and 15.1 pg/mL at 24 hours postoperatively (P = .52). Median CRP levels in the LESS and LC groups, respectively, were 0.33 and 0.44 mg/mL preoperatively, 0.40 and 0.45 mg/mL (P = .73) at 3 hours postoperatively, and 1.7 and 1.82 mg/mL (P = .84) at 24 hours postoperatively. We did not find a significant association between IL-6 (and CRP) and body mass index in the LESS group. CONCLUSIONS LESS cholecystectomy requires a larger size incision than LC. We found a tendency of less postoperative pain following LESS cholecystectomy than LC. There was also a tendency toward lower early inflammatory impact following LESS cholecystectomy versus LC.

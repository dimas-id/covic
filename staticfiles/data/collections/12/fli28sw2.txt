Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a member of the beta-coronavirus genus of zoonotic origin that emerged in the Arabian Peninsula and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to assess the plasma levels of cytokines to evaluate the Th1/Th2 status among 46 MERS-CoV infected patients (19 asymptomatic and 27 symptomatic) and 52 normal healthy controls using a customized luminex kit. Comparative analysis of data between MERS-CoV infected patients and normal healthy controls revealed that whereas no difference was observed between asymptomatic MERS-CoV patients and controls, the mean plasma levels of IL-10 (44.69 ± 40.04 pg/mL vs 14.84 ± 6.96 pg/mL; p<0.0001), IL-4 (22.46 ± 8.02 pg/mL vs 16.01 ± 9.97 pg/mL; p<0.0001), IL-5 (10.78 ± 2.86 pg/mL vs 8.06 ± 1.41 pg/mL; p<0.0001) and IL-13 (14.51 ± 3.97 pg/mL vs 11.53 ± 4.16 pg/mL; p<0.003) in MERS-CoV symptomatic patients were significantly higher than the normal controls. The mean plasma levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were no different among the study groups. The cytokine profile among symptomatic MERS-CoV infected patients was skewed to Th2 type immune response.

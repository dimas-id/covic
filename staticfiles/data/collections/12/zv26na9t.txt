INTRODUCTION The potential of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) as a less invasive and more cosmetically appealing technique has prompted the expansion of its adoption. SILS has been shown to be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional multiport cholecystectomy, appendectomy, colectomy, and many other laparoscopic procedures. The objective of this study is to provide an initial report of the feasibility of correcting intestinal malrotation via a single-incision laparoscopic transumbilical approach. CASE DESCRIPTION A 29-year-old woman presented with symptomatic congenital intestinal malrotation. She elected to undergo a Ladd's procedure using a single-incision laparoscopic approach with a SILS port and standard laparoscopic instruments. The procedure was accomplished without additional ports or conversion to laparotomy, and no intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted. Total operative time was 106 minutes. The patient had minimal postoperative pain and was satisfied with the cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSION When performed by a surgeon experienced in the SILS technique, single-incision laparoscopic Ladd's procedure for symptomatic intestinal malrotation in an adult is feasible and safe, with minimal postoperative pain and favorable cosmetic outcome.

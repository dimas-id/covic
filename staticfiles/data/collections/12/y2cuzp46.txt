On March 29th 2020, 97,689 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed only in Italy, with 73,880 actually positive cases, a daily increase of 3815 cases, 27,386 hospitalized and 3906 patients in intensive care units, causing a total of 10,779 known deaths. In all urological departments, quickly inpatient and outpatient services have been significantly reduced. Even in this COVID-19 situation, urological neoplasm care must go on, but significant changes need to be made in the way some care is delivered. We compared diagnostic and therapeutic elective procedures requested and performed for PC management from our multidisciplinary team (MDT) during 1 month activity in the highest national level of COVID-19 infection (March 2020) and under restrictions for all the population, with the management performed in a no-COVID-19 month (March 2019) 1 year ago. The only management that did not received a significant reduction are medical therapies for advanced hormone sensitive (HS) or castration resistant (CR) PC. We describe our MDT identifications of elective undeferrable PC management in this COVID-19 time. These suggestions have been considered for a country (ITALY) under a rapid increase of COVID-19 cases and complications, but in a region with an actual lower impact (2914 actual positive and 1079 hospitalized cases) from the infection and in an hospital not completely converted to COVID-19 management. Indications should be different and restricted only to emergencies on the basis of COVID-19 pandemic situation and hospital involvement.

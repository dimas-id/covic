BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy limits the risk of autonomic nerve damage, and the colpopexy allows correction of a concomitant prolapse of the middle compartment. The aim of this study is to describe a modified laparoscopic ventral rectocolpopexy procedure with a low approach to the sacral hollow (laparoscopic low ventral rectocolpopexy: LLVR). We propose this technique to manage combined rectogenital prolapse. METHODS Between November 2006 and June 2009, all patients with symptomatic rectal prolapse associated with genital prolapse and/or enterocele underwent LLVR. Demographics, results of imaging studies, mortality, morbidity, and functional outcome were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Thirty patients underwent LLVR: two patients suffered from a full-thickness rectal prolapse while 28 had symptomatic recto-anal intussusception. The mean operating time was 94 ± 39 minutes. Conversion to laparotomy was never needed. Hospital stay ranged between 2 and 14 days (mean of 5 ± 2.5 days). No mortality was recorded and only two complications occurred (6.6%): one trocar site incisional hernia and one vaginal suture erosion in a patient who had concomitant hysterectomy. After a mean follow-up of 13.9 months, constipation was completely resolved or improved in 92.8% patients. Significant reduction in the mean Altomare obstructed defecation score (14.7-5.6; p < 0.05) was recorded. Preoperative incontinence improved after the procedure in all patients affected. No new cases of postoperative constipation or fecal incontinence were registered. Only one case of recurrence in a patient with recto-anal intussusception was recorded (3.4%), after 19 months. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic low ventral rectocolpopexy is safe and associated with very low morbidity. In the medium term, it provides good result for prolapse and associated symptoms.

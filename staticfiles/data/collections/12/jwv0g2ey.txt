Gold salts have been used in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis since 1927 [1]. After a controlled study, the Empire Rheumatism Council [2], confirmed the effectiveness of gold salts for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Even today, chrysotherapy has remained one of the major therapeutic modalities in the second line treatment of progressive rheumatoid arthritis. Gold salts are also used in the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris [3] and bronchial asthma [4]. Before the introduction of an orally administered gold compound, auranofin (triethylphosphine gold tetra-acetyl glycopyranoside), to clinical use [5-7], parenterally administered gold salts, such as sodium aurothiomalate and gold thioglucose comprised chrysotherapy. The frequency and severity of the side effects for patients treated with parenteral gold versus those given oral gold preparations are significantly different [8-10]. With introduction of newer parental DMARDs, toxicity has been reduced using combination therapy [10a, 10b].

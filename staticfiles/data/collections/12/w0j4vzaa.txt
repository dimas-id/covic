BACKGROUND: As reported by increasing literature, a significant number of patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection developed smell/taste disorders. Aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and severity of these symptoms among laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 patients. Secondary objective is to determine their onset/recovery time. METHODS: This cross‐sectional study was conducted from March 10 to 30, 2020 at Novara University Hospital during the COVID‐19 Italian outbreak. The 355 enrolled patients answered a questionnaire at 14th (or more) days after proven infection. RESULTS: The overall population prevalence of both smell/taste or one of the two disorders was 70%. They were first symptoms in 31 (8,7%) patients. Most patients reported a complete loss that in half of the cases (49.5%) was fully recovered after 14 days, with a median recovery time of 10 days. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a high prevalence of smell/taste disorders in COVID‐19 infection with self‐recovery for half cases after about 2 weeks.

We cloned and sequenced the second open reading frame of the RNA polymerase gene, ORF1b, of bovine coronavirus. In the region representing nucleotide positions 4919-5677 upstream from the initiation codon of the 32K non-structural protein gene, we identified two putative functional domains. One of these domains contained four leucine residues repeated exactly in every seventh position, and the other domain represented a cluster of cysteine and histidine residues. The DNA sequence representing these domains was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum. A high level expression of the cysteine-rich domain was achieved as a fusion protein when the bacterial culture was induced with IPTG. In a solid phase zinc binding assay using the recombinant fusion protein, we found that the protein containing the cysteine-rich domain was able to bind to radioactive zinc in vitro, demonstrating that the polypeptide encoded by the ORF1b of coronavirus is a zinc-binding protein.

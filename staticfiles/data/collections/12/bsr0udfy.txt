BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow diverters are designed to occlude aneurysms while preserving flow to jailed arterial branches. We postulated that treatment success depended on the size of the aneurysm ostium or defect in the parent artery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flow diverter expansion and deformation were studied in silicone tubes with wall apertures of various sizes. Large and giant canine sidewall aneurysms, featuring a branch located immediately opposite the aneurysm, and a smaller 6- to 8-mm (group A, n = 6) or a larger 10- to 16-mm (group B, n = 6) ostium were created to study the effects of ostium size on aneurysm or branch occlusion by flow diverters. Angiographic results after deployment and at 3 months were scored by using an ordinal scale. The amount of neointima formation on the segment of the device overlying the aneurysm or the branch ostia was determined by specimen photography. RESULTS The fusiform deformation of flow diverters was maximal with larger defects in silicone tubes. At 3 months, group B aneurysms showed worse angiographic results than group A aneurysms, with larger residual aneurysm volumes (P = .002). Neointimal coverage of the aneurysm ostia was more complete in group A compared with group B (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS The effects of flow diversion may vary with the size of the aneurysm ostium.

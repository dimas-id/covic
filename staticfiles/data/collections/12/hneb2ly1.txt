BACKGROUND We hypothesize that standardizing operative equipment, and reducing variability can safely achieve cost reduction. METHODS We retrospectively measured supply costs, operative time, intra-operative complications, and length of stay in a cohort of 145 patients at a children's hospital who underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy. A standardized preference card for laparoscopic appendectomy was developed and implemented. Data were prospectively collected on 101 consecutive patients and compared to the retrospective cohort using multiple linear regression. A survey assessing the perception of surgeons, nurses and scrub technologists of the impact of standardization on patient safety, patient care, OR efficiency, and cost was conducted. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to evaluate associations between clinical role and years of experience with the total level of agreement on the survey. RESULTS A 20% average reduction was achieved in supply cost per case, with no significant change in operative time (p=0.14), total time in OR (p=0.15), or length of stay (p=0.60). No intra-operative complications were identified in either group. Survey participants agreed that standardization improves cost and safety. Nurses tended to have greater agreement that standardization improved efficiency and patient care compared to other roles (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS Standardization of operative equipment can result in a significant cost reduction without impacting quality or delivery of care. Based on average case number per year, a total annual cost savings of >$41,000 could be realized. Survey participants agree that standardization improves cost and patient safety, yet perceptions regarding the impact on efficiency and patient care varied by occupation.

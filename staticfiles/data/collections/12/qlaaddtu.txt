PURPOSE We determined the functional life of various configurations of partial nephrectomy closure systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sutures were prepared using standard techniques for sutured renorrhaphy during partial nephrectomy. Tested systems included knot/Hem-o-Lok®, Lapra-Ty®/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok combinations. The saline filled tank was maintained at 37C. Vicryl®, Stratafix™ polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone or V-Loc™ 180 sutures were suspended at 4 or 2 N. Suture material breakage or slippage was considered failure. RESULTS At 4 N 20% of sutures terminated with knot/Hem-o-Lok failed by 3 weeks compared to 56% and 100% terminated with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok, respectively (p <0.0001). The 55% and 100% of failures with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok, respectively, were generally due to slippage vs 11% with knot/Hem-o-Lok (p <0.0001). Overall failure rates with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok for zero to 4-zero sutures were 41% with Vicryl, 82% with polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone and 24% with V-Loc 180 (p <0.0001). The only sutures without failure at 4 N with Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok and knot/Hem-o-Lok closure systems were Vicryl zero, and V-Loc 2-zero and 3-zero. At 2 N Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok failure (17.5% vs 0%, p = 0.039) and Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok failure (39% vs 16%, p = 0.074) were more common with polyglycolic acid-polycaprolactone than with V-Loc sutures. CONCLUSION Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok and Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok combinations resulted in more frequent failures at 3 weeks or greater than knot/Hem-o-Lok. For all sutures tested knots were superior to Lapra-Tys to backstop Hem-o-Loks at 4 N. Preferably, Vicryl zero or V-Loc 2-zero/3-zero sutures should be used in combination with knots or Lapra-Tys at 4 N. Under these experimental conditions the Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok combination did not reliably suspend the other sutures tested for 3 weeks. If Lapra-Ty/Hem-o-Lok or Hem-o-Lok/Hem-o-Lok combinations are used, we recommend closure at lesser tension and/or the use of appropriate sutures.

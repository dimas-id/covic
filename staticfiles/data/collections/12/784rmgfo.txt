The probiotic engineering is a cutting edge technology for improving disease diagnosis, treating gastrointestinal disorders and infectious diseases, and improving nutrition and ecological health. Use of bioengineered microorganisms in animals has different targets and prospects owing to differences in their anatomy, physiology, and feeding habits. In ruminants, the bioengineered microorganism is primarily aimed to enhance nutrient utilization, detoxify toxic plant metabolites, and lessen the enteric methanogenesis, while in non-ruminants, the bioengineered microorganisms are aimed to enhance nutrient utilizations, confer protection against pathogens, and inhibit infectious agents. Highlights The microorganisms can be engineered to enhance their metabolic efficiency. The bioengineered microorganisms could solve the burgeoning problem of drug-resistant pathogens. The recombinant probiotics are promising therapeutic agents against infectious diseases.

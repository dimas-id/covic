Although second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) have improved outcomes in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), important unmet needs remain. Two symposia at EuroPCR 2015 focused on two challenging scenarios. First, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have generally inferior outcomes following PCI. The Cre8™ stent (manufactured by CID Spa, member of Alvimedica Group) has shown unique efficacy in subpopulations of patients with DM during clinical trials. A live case in a patient with diabetes illustrated the challenges of complex multivessel disease. Second, optimising stent selection towards devices that have demonstrated complete and early endothelialisation offers the potential to reduce the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The Cre8™ DES features a polymer-free platform and has been associated with low rates of in-stent thrombosis.

Abstract To predict, detect, prepare for, and prevent potential emerging infectious diseases caused by unknown microorganisms in the future, we have proposed the research field of reverse microbial etiology. We isolate and classify unknown microorganisms and assesse their ability to cause infection, an outbreak, or epidemic. We suggest a list of potential pathogens and propose a preparation, prevention, and control strategy to protect global health and global economy and to ensure global security.

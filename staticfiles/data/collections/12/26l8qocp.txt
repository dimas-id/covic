Cervical epidural anesthesia (CEA) is generally not used during upper-arm vascular surgery for hemodialysis in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, despite its advantages. The Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire (QOR-40) has been validated as a tool for assessing the degree of recovery after surgery. We hypothesized that CEA could provide a better outcome on the QOR-40 than general anesthesia after upper-arm vascular surgery for hemodialysis in ESRD patients.We divided anesthetic methods into general anesthesia and CEA. The QOR-40 was administered to 70 patients on the night before surgery and at 24 hours after surgery. Additional data, including consumption of opioid analgesics, occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and scores on a numeric rating scale (NRS) were collected.The total QOR-40 scores of the two groups differed significantly (P = .024) on postoperative day 1. Opioid consumption (P = .005) and occurrence of postoperative nausea (P = .019) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) were significantly lower in the CEA group, whose NRS scores were significantly lower in the PACU (P < .001) and at postoperative day 1 (P = .016).Assessment of postoperative quality of recovery after upper-arm vascular surgery in ESRD patients showed that the CEA group had significantly better total QOR-40 and NRS scores. CEA could be used as an alternative anesthetic technique for upper-arm vascular surgery for hemodialysis in ESRD patients to improve the quality of recovery.

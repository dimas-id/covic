BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence, patient characteristics, and potential risk factors for secondary hemorrhage after total laparoscopic hysterectomy. METHODS All women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy at Paul's Hospital between January 2004 and April 2012 were included in the study. Patients who had bleeding per vaginam between 24 hours and 6 weeks after primary surgery were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 1613 patients underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy during the study period, and 21 patients had secondary hemorrhage after hysterectomy. The overall cumulative incidence of secondary hemorrhage after total laparoscopic hysterectomy was 1.3%. The mean size of the uterus was 541.4 g in the secondary hemorrhage group and 318.9 g in patients without hemorrhage, which was statistically significant. The median time interval between hysterectomy and secondary hemorrhage was 13 days. Packing was sufficient to control the bleeding in 13 patients, and 6 patients required vault suturing. Laparoscopic coagulation of the uterine artery was performed in 1 patient. Uterine artery embolization was performed twice in 1 patient to control the bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that secondary hemorrhage is rare but may occur more often after total laparoscopic hysterectomy than after other hysterectomy approaches. Whether it is related to the application of thermal energy to tissues, which causes more tissue necrosis and devascularization than sharp culdotomy in abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies, is not clear. A large uterus size, excessive use of an energy source for the uterine artery, and culdotomy may play a role.

This study validated the Hungarian version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators Survey on a sample of n = 211 elementary and secondary teachers. To test factorial validity, we ran a series of confirmatory analysis with eight models. The best fitting model was the bifactor model with general burnout and three specific factors: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Analyzing the covariates revealed that gender and age were not associated with burnout, but depressive symptoms and overcommitment had a significant relationship with general burnout, and overcommitment was related to emotional exhaustion as well.

Abstract Background The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) resulted in multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. In response, we developed a nurse-led program to screen and triage patients with MERS-CoV infection. Methods A formal educational program was implemented to ensure a standardized approach to care planning and delivery. The essential skills that were included were the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gown, gloves, head cover and N95 mask, hand hygiene, the practice of donning and doffing and the collection of MERS-CoV nasopharyngeal specimens. Results A core group of nurses were identified from high-risk units. The education program consisted of four skill-days. Nurses were assigned a pre-course work from Mosbyâ€™s Nursing Skills, an online skill module, donning and doffing of PPE, and the process for obtaining a nasopharyngeal swab. The skill lab incorporated multiple methods such group discussion, watching an on-line video, and a simulated demonstration and practice on a mannequin. In total, 450 nurses attended the Nasopharyngeal Skills Day and 1000 nurses received training. Donning and doffing PPE and N95 mask fit testing has become an annual mandatory competency requirement for staff in nursing and clinical services. Conclusion The application of specified protocols minimizes the risks of cross infection, placing emphasis on patient and staff safety as well as expediting the patient to definitive treatment. Nurse educators have an instrumental role in training nurses and other healthcare providers on the specifics needed to identify, contain and manage patient presenting with MERS-CoV.

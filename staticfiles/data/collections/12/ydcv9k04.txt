The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic, threatening global public health. In the current paper, we describe our successful treatment of one COVID-19 pneumonia patient case with high mortality risk factors. Our experience underlines the importance of the use of a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in order to achieve a favorable clinical outcome. Further, enhancing the capability of the COVID-19 diagnosis with the use of the chest imaging modalities is discussed.

BACKGROUND Recent pandemic of coronavirus disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in humans is the third outbreak by this family of viruses leading to an acute respiratory infection which has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.The virus belongs to the genus, Betacoronavirus which has been recently reported to have significant similarity (>89%) to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related member of the Sarbecoviruses. Current researches are not sufficient to understand the etiological and immunopathobiological parameters related to COVID-19 so as to have a therapeutic solution to the problem. METHODS A structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature has been carried out using focused review questions and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Further Standard tools were implied in order to appraise the quality of retrieved papers. The characteristic outcomes of screened research and review articles along with analysis of the interventions and findings of included studies using a conceptual framework have been described employing a deductive qualitative content analysis methodology. RESULTS This review systematically summarizes the immune-pathobiological characteristics, diagnosis, potential therapeutic options for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 based on the current published literature and evidence. The current review has covered 125 peer-reviewed articles, majority of which are from high-income technically developed countries providing the most recent updates about the current understanding of the COVID-19 bringing all the significant findings and related researches together at a single platform. In addition, possible therapeutic interventions, treatment strategies and vaccine development initiatives to manage COVID-19 have been proposed. CONCLUSIONS It is anticipated that this review would certainly assist the public in general and scientific community in particular to recognize and effectively deal with COVID-19, providing a reference guide for futuristic studies.

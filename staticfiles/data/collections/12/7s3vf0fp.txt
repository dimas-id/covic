BACKGROUND: There are few studies on the safety and respiratory consequences of the use of a skeletal traction (ST) device in the management of femoral shaft fractures with damage control orthopaedics (DCO) strategy, particularly in cases of prolonged use. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of ST compared with an external fixator (EF) on respiratory complications and mechanical ventilation requirements in patients with severe trauma with a femoral shaft fracture managed by DCO strategy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with severe trauma patients with a unilateral femoral shaft fracture admitted to our institution from 2010 to 2015. Patients who did not undergo definitive osteosynthesis during the first 24 h were included and divided into two groups: DCO-ST group and DCO-EF group. In addition to trauma severity, global management of respiratory complications, the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation requirements and outcome were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were managed with DCO strategy (mean Injury Severity Score, 28.4); there were 31 in the DCO-ST group and 24 in the DCO-EF group. No significant difference in terms of the main characteristics, initial severity and associated injuries was observed between the two groups. In contrast, ARDS was found more frequently in the DCO-ST group (81% versus 54%; P = 0.035). Number of ventilation days also tended to be higher in the DCO-ST group (9 days [IQR 3–15 days] versus 7 [IQR 2–16 days]; P = 0.24). No difference was found for mortality and hospitalization duration between the DCO-ST and DCO-EF groups. CONCLUSION: The prolonged use of an ST device in the present cohort was associated with a higher incidence of impaired respiratory function. Therefore, our findings suggest that EF is preferable to ST in the DCO setting for femoral shaft fracture, especially in trauma patients at high risk of developing delayed respiratory failure.

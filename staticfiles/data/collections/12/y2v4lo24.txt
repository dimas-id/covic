The current study aimed to determine the level of fear of COVID-19 among Indian residents using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and compare it with demographic variables. This cross-sectional online survey conducted among the Indian population employed a convenient snowball sampling technique. Age, gender, marital status, educational qualifications, health care worker status and state of residence were the demographic details (six items) collected. The seven-item FCV-19S was used to assess fear regarding COVID−19 on a five-point Likert scale. The mean score for the responses was calculated and compared based on demographic variables. A comparison of low and high levels of fear and a multiple logistic regression analysis of levels of fear with demographic variables were conducted. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study population comprised 45.6% (683) males and 54.4% (816) females, with approximately 68% belonging to the age group of 20–40 years. The overall mean score for the questionnaire was 18.00 + 5.68. A significantly higher number of the study population reported low fear (54.8%). Only gender (p = 0.08) and health care worker status (p = 0.02) revealed a significant difference based on the level of fear. Females, married status, lower educational status and being a health care worker displayed significantly higher odds for high level of fear compared to their respective counterparts in this study population. The findings of this study may help to identify the groups most at risk and formulate tailor-made intervention strategies to ensure their optimal health in this time of global crisis.

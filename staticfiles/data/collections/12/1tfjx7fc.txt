BACKGROUND We report our experience of transumbilical single port laparoscopic surgery (TUSPLS) for multiple concomitant intraabdominal pathologies, and assess the feasibility of this technique with several technical tips. METHODS Various combined procedures using TUSPLS were performed since April, 2008. All records of concomitant laparoscopic procedures using TUSPLS were searched at three hospitals. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent 82 combined procedures using TUSPLS in a single session. The perioperative outcomes of simultaneously performed cholecystectomy and ovarian cystectomy using TUSPLS (n = 14) are compared with those of using CLS (n = 11). The operating time was significantly longer with the TUSPLS method than with the CLS method. However, postoperative convalescent outcomes such as postoperative hospital stay, VAS pain score, and required analgesics showed no differences between the two methods. Also, there were no significant operative complications associated with the two methods. Fewer trocars were used with the TUSPLS method. CONCLUSIONS Combined laparoscopic procedures for various concomitant pathologies in the abdomen can be performed using transumbilical single port laparoscopic surgery without increasing morbidity or hospital stay in patients with acceptable risk.

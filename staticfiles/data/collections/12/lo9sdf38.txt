Abstract Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) CH virulent strain was first isolated from an infected duck and it was found that this virus strain could induce cytopathic effect (CPE) in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF). Following AHV-1 infection, DEF showed morphological changes such as cell rounding, improved refractivity and detachment from the culture surface. However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately known. Related studies were performed and the results showed that syncytium formation could be observed as the other type of CPE in AHV-1 infection. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and 4â€™, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of infected DEF were each used to visualize the shape and distribution of chromatin within nuclei and nuclear fragmentation was observed. Chromatin condensation and margination, as well as formation of apoptotic bodies were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DNA ladder formation was detected in AHV-1 infected cells and apoptosis of the infected DEF was also detected by flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. Therefore, it was suggested that AHV-1 virulent strain can induce syncytium and apoptosis in DEF. Syncytium formation and apoptosis observed in this study may contribute to the elucidation of AHV-1 pathogenesis.

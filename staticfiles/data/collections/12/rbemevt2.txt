Abstract After the eruption of the most deadly influenza flu pandemic in 1918, also known as Spanish flu, infected about 500 million people with a death toll of approximately 50 million globally, the second most devastating pandemic flue emerged in December 2019 at Wuhan (Hubei Province) of China. This viral disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-COV-2 was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO). The COVID-19 virus affected 213 countries globally with 5.6 million cases and 353,373 deaths as of May 28, 2020 [1] (Fig. 1). Still, there is no promising solution known to tackle this severe epidemic disease worldwide. Protecting the global population from COVID-19 we must follow three steps â€“ early detection, monitoring, and treatment. At the same time, it is important to follow WHO guidelines on preventive measures. Many countries have restricted the movement of people completely and lockdown enforced to maintain social distancing. But lockdown alone is insufficient to prevent resurgence, can upend economies and roil society. People need to step out to perform essential tasks and may get exposed to this deadly virus. Learnings from previous outbreaks suggest the usage of nanotechnology as an important avenue to develop antiviral drugs and materials. So, to effectively minimize the acquired infection of COVID-19 in public places like hospitals, transport, schools, worship places, stores, malls, etc. antimicrobial nanocoatings at these places and development of targeted antiviral drugs through capped nanoparticles will be a major effective option to tackle the spread of this disease.

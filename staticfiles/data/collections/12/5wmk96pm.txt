Evaluation of: Wolf MC, Freiberg AN, Zhang T et al. A broad-spectrum antiviral targeting entry of enveloped viruses. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 107, 3157-3162 (2010). The emergence and re-emergence of viruses and the widespread antiviral resistance calls for the development of a broad-spectrum strategy for viral infection. The article under review describes an approach to achieve this goal by developing an antiviral rhodanine derivative effective against enveloped viruses targeting the viral lipid membrane. By intercalating into the viral membrane, the compound irreversibly inactivates the virions with virucidal effects. Potential toxic effects on hosts could be minimized by continuous regeneration of cellular membranes. The present strategy exploits the therapeutic window that exists between static viral membranes and biogenic cellular membranes and provides a useful guideline for future research endeavors towards broad-spectrum antiviral approaches for enveloped viruses. Developing a formulation that ensures efficient delivery and pharmacokinetic properties while minimizing systemic toxicity on cell membranes remains a challenge. The advantages and disadvantages of a viral membrane-targeting approach for the control of emerging and re-emerging viruses will be discussed.

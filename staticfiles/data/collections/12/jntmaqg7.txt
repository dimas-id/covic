BACKGROUND: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a worldwide epidemic since its discovery. The outbreak of virus infection has aroused great concern of the World Health Organization (WHO). COVID-19 is highly infectious and has a high infection rate. So far, no specific drug has been found to cure it. China as one of the first countries attacked by epidemic has shown outstanding in fighting against the COVID-19. The contribution of traditional Chinese medicine can not be ignored. As a kind of representative of traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese patent medicine injection has significant effect in reducing the clinical symptoms of patients and preventing the deterioration of the disease. However, there is no systematic review of its efficacy and safety. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: All randomized controlled trials of Chinese patent medicine injection for COVID-19 will be included. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature database and some clinical trial registration websites. Two researchers will independently screen titles, abstracts, full texts, and extract data, then assess the bias risk of each study. We will conduct meta-analyses to assess all the available evidence of the efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Systematic review of current evidence will be provided from the indexes of efficacy and safety. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine injection in the treatment of COVID-19 will be provided to clinicians.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020182725.

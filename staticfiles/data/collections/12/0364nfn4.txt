Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. We have since seen its fast spread worldwide. A likely contributing factor was the lack of symptoms of some of the carriers, making them unaware of their risk of spreading to other more vulnerable individuals. The other important finding has been the reported cases of infectivity despite lack of symptoms. We describe the SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia patterns in asymptomatic individuals. The common computed tomography (CT) thorax patterns found are peripheral ground‐glass opacification (GGO) with upper or lower lobe predominance. We believe screening for 2019‐novel coronavirus (COVID‐19) in high‐risk individuals may help identify the patients needing longer follow‐up.

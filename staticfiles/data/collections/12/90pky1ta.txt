This paper presents label-free electrochemical transduction as a suitable scheme for COVID-19-specific viral RNA/c-DNA detection, with an aim to facilitate point of care diagnosis. In lieu of this, we discuss the proposed electrochemical biosensing scheme, based on electrodeposited gold nanoparticles as the transducing elements. Specific to this approach, here, the protocols associated with the immobilization of the single-stranded probe nucleotide on to the biosensor, have also been laid out. This paper also discusses the methods of electrochemical analysis, to be used for data acquisition and subsequent calibration, in relation to target analyte detection. Towards facilitating portable diagnosis, development of miniaturized sensors and their integration with readout units have also been discussed.

Transcriptome-wide mapping of posttranscriptional modifications in eukaryotic RNA revealed tens of thousands of modification sites. Modified nucleotides include 6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytidine, pseudouridine, inosine, etc. Many modification sites are conserved, and many are regulated. The function is known for a minor subset of modified nucleotides, while the role of their majority is still obscure. In view of the global character of mRNA modification, RNA epigenetics arose as a new field of molecular biology. The review considers posttranscriptional modification of eukaryotic mRNA, focusing on the major modified nucleotides, the role they play in the cell, the methods to detect them, and the enzymes responsible for modification.

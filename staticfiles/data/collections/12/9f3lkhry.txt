BACKGROUND: Foot‐and‐mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes a severe livestock disease, and the virus is an interesting target for virology and vaccine studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we evaluated comparatively three different viral antigen‐encoding DNA sequences, delivered via two physical means (i.e., gene gun delivery into skin and electroporation delivery into muscle), for naked DNA‐mediated vaccination in a mouse system. RESULTS: Both methods gave similar results, demonstrating commonality of the observed DNA vaccine effects. Immunization with a cDNA vector expressing the major viral antigen (VP1) alone routinely failed to induce the production of anti‐VP1 or neutralizing antibodies in test mice. As a second approach, the plasmid L‐VP1 that produces a transgenic membrane‐anchored VP1 protein elicited a strong antibody response, but all test mice failed in the FMDV challenge experiment. In contrast, for mice immunized with the viral capsid precursor protein (P1) cDNA expression vector, both neutralizing antibodies and 80–100% protection in test mice were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy of using the whole capsid precursor protein P1 cDNA for vaccination, intentionally without the use of virus‐specific protease or other encoding genes for safety reasons, may thus be employed as a relevant experimental system for induction or upgrading of effective neutralizing antibody response, and as a convenient surrogate test system for DNA vaccination studies of FMDV and presumably other viral diseases.

We read with interest a research letter by Ng et al., which described their experience in prone positioning (PP) for awake patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and concluded that this maneuver could delay or reduce the need for intensive care [1]. We agree that the authors demonstrated safety and feasibility of PP in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. However, we humbly suggest a few crucial points be addressed before drawing conclusions on the efficacy of PP.

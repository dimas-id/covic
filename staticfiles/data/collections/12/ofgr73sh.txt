BACKGROUND Radiofrequency has been used as a tool for liver resection since 2002. A new laparoscopic device is reported in this article that assists liver resection laparoscopically. METHODS From October 2006 to the present, patients suitable for liver resection were assessed carefully for laparoscopic resection with the laparoscopic Habib Sealer (LHS). Detailed data of patients resected laparoscopically with this device were collected prospectively and analyzed. RESULTS In all, 28 patients underwent attempted laparoscopic liver resection. Four cases had to be converted to an open approach because of extensive adhesions from previous colonic operations. Twenty-four patients completed the procedure comprising tumorectomy (n = 7), multiple tumoretcomies (n = 5), segmentectomy (n = 3), and bisegmentectomies (n = 9). Vascular clamping of portal triads was not used. The mean resection time was 60 +/- 23 min (mean +/- SD), and blood loss was 48 +/- 54 mL. None of the patients received any transfusion of blood or blood products perioperatively or postoperatively. Postoperatively, 1 patient developed severe exacerbation of asthma that required steroid therapy, and 1 other patient had a transient episode of liver failure that required supportive care. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.6 +/- 2 days (mean +/- SD). At a short-term follow up, no recurrence was detected in patients with liver cancer. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic liver resection can be performed safely with this new laparoscopic liver resection device with a significantly low risk of intraoperative bleeding or postoperative complications.

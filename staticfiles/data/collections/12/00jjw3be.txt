Polyomaviruses (PyV) WU and KI are reportedly associated with respiratory tract disease (RTD) worldwide but their incidence is unclear in Japan. In a 2 year prospective study, WU/KIPyV were detected in 48 (13.9%) and in five (1.4%) of 345 children hospitalized with lower RTD, respectively. The seasonal distribution was observed in spring and early summer. Other respiratory viruses were co‐detected in 51% of PyV‐positive patients, but eight (2.3%) of the WUPyV‐positive patients were negative for other known pathogens.

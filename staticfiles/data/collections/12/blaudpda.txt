Arthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease(1). The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized(2). Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen, we identified the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River, Mayaro, and Oâ€™nyong nyong (ONNV) viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced viral infection of cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to CHIKV particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked CHIKV infection in multiple cell types including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of CHIKV E2, a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of Mxr8a-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies reduced CHIKV or ONNV infection and associated foot swelling in mice. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Spontaneous or progressive occlusion of the posterior fossa dural sinuses is often observed in patients with vein of Galen malformation, which can affect the clinical course. The aim of this study was to examine the patency of the posterior fossa dural sinuses in patients with vein of Galen malformation and to analyze the clinical and angiographic course of this condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 61 consecutive children with vein of Galen malformations. Clinical presentation, management, outcome, and angiographic change were analyzed for the patients with attention paid to all dural sinus occlusions. RESULTS Twenty patients (32.8%) demonstrated spontaneous sinus occlusion, mostly in the sigmoid sinus. This condition was not observed in neonates and was first discovered during infancy or childhood. Progression of sinus occlusion was seen in 10 patients, and the conditions of 6 of them deteriorated in accordance with the progression of sinus occlusion. After total or subtotal obliteration of the malformation by transarterial glue embolization, 13 patients recovered to healthy, 3 patients had only mild developmental delay, and 4 patients remained neurologically disabled. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous sinus occlusion is not a rare condition and can result in neurologic deterioration in the natural history of untreated vein of Galen malformation. If signs of progressive sinus occlusion are noticed, early arteriovenous shunt reduction or elimination by transarterial glue embolization is expected to prevent permanent brain damage.

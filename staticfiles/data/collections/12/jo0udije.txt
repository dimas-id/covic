Team Epi-Aid provides graduate students with practical public health experience through participation in outbreak investigations and other applied projects with state and local health departments in North Carolina. It is an initiative of the North Carolina Center for Public Health Preparedness in the North Carolina Institute for Public Health at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health. The program allows state and local health departments access to volunteers and technical expertise from the university when they need assistance. It requires close collaboration with state and county health departments. Team Epi-Aid provides the opportunity for integrated learning with students and faculty within the departments of the School of Public Health, and through recent expansion, within the schools of Medicine and Pharmacy. Orientations are conducted each semester and formal training is provided as needed. Team Epi-Aid has been popular, with 58 active student participants contributing 1,465 hours of service during the initiative's first 21 months.

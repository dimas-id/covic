Abstract A rapid, facile and selective detection of anti-H5 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) antibody in serum by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) was achieved. A fragment of recombinant H5 subtype AIVhemagglutinin was produced and labeled with fluorescein to use it as a labeled antigen in FPIA. This labeled antigen was mixed with anti-AIV sera (H1–H16 subtypes) and FP of the mixture was measured using a portable FP analyzer on a microdevice. It was found that FP increased in proportion to the concentration of anti-H5 AIV antibody (serum) and was significantly higher than FP obtained with the other sera. The selective detection of anti-H5 subtype AIV antibody was confirmed. The required volume of original sample was 2 μL and analysis time was within 20 min. This detection system realizes an efficient on-site diagnosis and surveillance of AIV.

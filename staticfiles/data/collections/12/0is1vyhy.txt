We present Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) statistics in China dataset: daily statistics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China at the city/county level. For each city/country, we include the six most important numbers for epidemic research: daily new infections, accumulated infections, daily new recoveries, accumulated recoveries, daily new deaths, and accumulated deaths. We cross validate the dataset and the estimate error rate is about 0.04%. We then give several examples to show how to trace the spreading in particular cities or provinces, and also contrast the development of COVID-19 in all cities in China at the early, middle and late stages. We hope this dataset can help researchers around the world better understand the spreading dynamics of COVID-19 at a regional level, to inform intervention and mitigation strategies for policymakers.

Generating appropriate motor commands is an essential brain function. To achieve proper motor control in diverse situations, predicting future states of the environment and body and modifying the prediction are indispensable. The internal model is a promising hypothesis about brain function for generating and modifying the prediction. Although several findings support the involvement of the cerebellum in the internal model, recent results support the influence of other related brain regions on the internal model. A representative example is the motor adaptation ability in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Although this ability provides some hints about how dopamine deficits and other PD symptoms affect the internal model, previous findings are inconsistent; some reported a deficit in the motor adaptation ability in PD patients, but others reported that the motor adaptation ability of PD patients is comparable to that of healthy controls. A possible factor causing this inconsistency is the difference in task settings, resulting in different cognitive strategies in each study. Here, we demonstrate a larger, but not better, motor adaptation ability in PD patients than in healthy controls while reducing the involvement of cognitive strategies and concentrating on implicit motor adaptation abilities. This study utilizes a smart-device-based experiment that enables motor adaptation experiments anytime and anywhere with less cognitive strategy involvement. The PD patients showed a significant response to insensible environmental changes, but the response was not necessarily suitable for adapting to the changes. Our findings support compensatory cerebellar functions in PD patients from the perspective of motor adaptation.

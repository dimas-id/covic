We sought to determine the burden of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection in comparison to other healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in community hospitals participating in an infection control network. Our data suggest that C. difficile has replaced MRSA as the most common etiology of HAI in community hospitals in the southeastern United States.

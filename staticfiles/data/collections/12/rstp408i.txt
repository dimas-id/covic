OBJECTIVE To assess the quality and length of recovery from anaesthesia induced with either propofol or alfaxalone and maintained with isoflurane, in cats undergoing short procedures in private veterinary practice. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, blinded, randomized study. ANIMALS Ninety-three healthy mixed breed cats. METHODS After premedication with intramuscular acepromazine (0.05 mg kg(-1)) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg kg(-1)), cats were randomly allocated to receive either propofol (Group P) or alfaxalone (Group A) for induction of anaesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporized in oxygen. The quality of induction, physiological parameters throughout anaesthesia and the duration of both surgery and anaesthesia were recorded. The level of ambient noise, recovery times, number of attempts to stand, reaction of the cat to touch 15 minutes after extubation, and other relevant characteristics of the recovery period were noted and a video recording of the recovery was made. The videos were assessed by a second, blinded anaesthetist, using simple descriptive and visual analogue scales. RESULTS No statistically significant differences between groups with respect to preoperative data, premedication, surgery, anaesthesia and recovery times and scores were observed. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients paddling and trembling on recovery in Group A (p = 0.032) even though there was no statistically significant difference in the level of ambient noise in the recovery ward or in the overall quality of recovery. CONCLUSIONS Both propofol and alfaxalone provide good recovery characteristics in premedicated cats undergoing short procedures in clinical settings. Alfaxalone induction was associated with more episodes of paddling and trembling during recovery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Both agents would appear appropriate for induction of anaesthesia in cats for short procedures.

Detection of elliptical features is a challenging and important task in computer vision. In fact, ellipses can describe many objects in real images like manufactured objects, cells, ball, or traffic signs. Furthermore, an ellipse is defined by five parameters: the center coordinates, the semi major axe, the semi minor axe and the orientation, which require more computational power to estimate them. Some non-ideal ellipses cause also difficulties for detection such as occlusion, appearance of multiple ellipses at same time and non-parallel ellipse. In this paper, we are interested in detecting elliptical traffic signs. We present a method for detecting different cases of ellipses: simple, partially occluded, non-parallel, multiple ellipses in images. The method selects three lines to find the ellipse center, and then it calculates the value of the semi minor and major axes of the ellipse. Experiments show that the proposed method performs well on real images in the presence or not of noises.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe disease for which currently no specific therapy is available. The use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial and its mode of action poorly understood. We demonstrate that hydroxychloroquine inhibits trained immunity at the functional and epigenetic level and is accompanied by profound changes in the cellular lipidome as well as reduced expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Trained immunity comprises a functional adaptation induced by epigenetic reprogramming which facilitates the anti-viral innate immune response. Our findings therefore suggest that hydroxychloroquine may not have a beneficial effect on the anti-viral immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

Several diagnostic methods including immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry have been developed for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). An immunohistochemical method using a new recombinant antibody produced by a phage antibody system (PAS16) kit was investigated and compared with that using a monoclonal antibody for PEDV detection in PEDV-infected piglets. In both the immunohistochemical methods, PEDV antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes and in the macrophages infiltrated in the lamina propria at 18 to 110 hr post inoculation. The positive signals with the recombinant PAS16 antibody were similar to those with the monoclonal antibody. This result suggests that the recombinant PAS16 antibody can be applicable for the rapid immunohistochemical diagnosis of PEDV infection.

The application of advanced endovascular techniques in very complex femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions has shown to expose patients to a higher risk of distal embolization (DE). This complication can affect both the short- and long-term outcomes, leading to worsening ischemia, early minor/major amputation, and longer hospital stay. Recently, there has been an increasing body of evidence on pathophysiology and clinical-radiological management of DE that however has not been systematically addressed by guidelines. The aim of this review was to analyze the current evidence outlining definition and classification, risk assessment, prevention, and management strategies of DE in femoropopliteal endovascular interventions.

Abstracts In public health, the plight of the solitary elderly is associated with serious social and medical burden. In this vulnerable population, neuropsychiatric complications such as senile depression and dementia as well as chronic pain conditions often co-occur. In this case report, we present a case of an 81-year-old solitary woman who received one year of visiting care service with Korean medicine treatments in a public health setting. During the one year, her pain severity (measured using numeric rating scale) remained moderate after her initial decline and her depressive symptoms and cognitive function scales (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form Korean and the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination for Dementia Screening) remained almost unchanged; however, another cognitive function scale (Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) showed noticeable improvements. This case report suggests that providing visiting care services with Korean medicine may be a viable strategy for addressing the issues of the solitary elderly.

The conventional statistical methodologies for evaluating treatment effect are based on hypothesis testing (P-value). Alternative measurements of treatment effect have been proposed for anti-infective treatments using the probability of target attainment. A general framework is proposed to extend this methodology to other therapeutic areas. A disease trial model is used for estimating the probability of reaching a treatment effect associated with relevant clinical benefits, in complement to the evaluation of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. A case study is presented in depression, where disease status is evaluated using bounded clinical scores (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), and detectable treatment effect is inversely proportional to placebo response. The Î²-regression approach is used to model Hamilton scale scores, and a placebo-related criterion is proposed for determining the clinical benefit. The probability of reaching a clinical benefit represents a reliable criterion for replacing the P-value paradigm in the assessment of the outcomes of clinical trials.

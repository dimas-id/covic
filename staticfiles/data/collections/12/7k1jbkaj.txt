Objective: To study the effect of growth hormone (GH) on albumin synthesis in critically ill patients. Design: Prospective randomized controlled study. Setting: Two intensive care units, university hospital and county hospital, respectively. Patients: Twenty-two critically ill patients in the intensive care unit. Interventions: Albumin synthesis was measured twice in each patient, with a 5-day interval. The patients in the control group (n=11) received standard intensive care unit (ICU) treatment between measurements, whereas those in the GH group (n=11) also received 0.3 U/kg daily of human recombinant GH. Measurements and results: Albumin synthesis was measured by labeling with L-[(2)H(5)]phenylalanine. In the control group, the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of albumin was 16.3±4.1%/day (mean and SD) in the first measurement and 15.7±4.2%/day 5 days later (NS), whereas in the GH group the corresponding values were 17.0±4.7%/day and 16.7±5.5%/day (NS). The calculated absolute synthesis rates of albumin, based on FSR and intravascular albumin mass, also showed no effect of GH. Conclusion: Albumin synthesis rates were consistently higher in the two groups of critically ill patients than previously reported values in healthy subjects. However, GH treatment for 5 days neither stimulated nor inhibited albumin synthesis rates in these critically ill patients.

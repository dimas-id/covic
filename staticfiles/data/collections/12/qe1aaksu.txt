BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to validate the eoSim box laparoscopic simulator using measures of construct, concurrent, and content validity. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Forty-seven novice and expert participants were tested on both the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS™; Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, Los Angles, CA) and eoSim (eoSurgical™, Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom) laparoscopic simulators, using established scoring mechanisms. Three skill areas were examined: object transfer, precision cutting, and intracorporeal suturing. A questionnaire was also completed. RESULTS Experts performed significantly better on the eoSim than novices, with a median score of 51.1% versus 14.8% (P<.0001), showing construct validity. There was a high correlation between performance on the validated FLS simulator and the eoSim (0.78; P<.0001), demonstrating concurrent validity. Feedback from participants indicated an agreement that the eoSim was a useful training tool providing content validity. CONCLUSIONS The eoSim demonstrates validity as a model for laparoscopic simulation. It is hoped that its decreased cost relative to other simulators will encourage increased uptake by trainees and institutions.

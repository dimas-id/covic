Hendra and Nipah viruses (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus) are zoonotic RNA viruses that cause lethal disease in humans and are designated as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) agents. Moreover, henipaviruses belong to the same group of viruses that cause disease more commonly in humans such as measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial virus. Due to the relatively recent emergence of the henipaviruses and the practical constraints of performing functional genomics studies at high levels of containment, our understanding of the henipavirus infection cycle is incomplete. In this chapter we describe recent loss-of-function (i.e. RNAi) functional genomics screens that shed light on the henipavirus–host interface at a genome-wide level. Further to this, we cross-reference RNAi results with studies probing host proteins targeted by henipavirus proteins, such as nuclear proteins and immune modulators. These functional genomics studies join a growing body of evidence demonstrating that nuclear and nucleolar host proteins play a crucial role in henipavirus infection. Furthermore these studies will underpin future efforts to define the role of nucleolar host–virus interactions in infection and disease.

We describe a case of a previously healthy 2-year-old female patient with rash, fever and vomiting for 10 days who presented for medical attention with acute profound balance and gait disturbances and intentional movement dysmetria. West Nile virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid.

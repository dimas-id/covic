PURPOSE Mesh fixation is essential in laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of inguinal hernia; however, fixation sometimes causes post-operative pain. This study investigated a novel method of laparoscopic TEP repair without mesh fixation. METHODS This study reviewed data from about two-hundred and forty-one laparoscopic TEP repairs on 219 patients, which were performed between December 2004 and October 2005. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in the recurrence rate, seroma formation, and hospital stay. However, the mean operation time was shorter in the internal plug mesh group than the fixation group (p = 0.009), and post-operative pain only occurred in 4 cases in the internal plug mesh group in comparison to 29 cases in the mesh fixation group (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS An internal plug mesh without fixation might reduce post-operative pain after laparoscopic TEP repair of an inguinal hernia. Internal plug mesh without fixation may be an alternative method in laparoscopic TEP repair, especially for those involving indirect hernias.

BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), an advanced form of minimally invasive surgery, has recently been used for surgical management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The literature comparing SILS to conventional laparoscopic surgery for treatment of this disease is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of SILS compared with conventional laparoscopic resection for GIST. METHODS A retrospective case-cohort study compared the benefits and outcomes of SILS and conventional laparoscopic partial gastrectomy for GIST. Between April 2008 and December 2012, 39 patients underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric stromal tumors in our department. All operations were performed by a single experienced surgeon. The medical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively with regard to tumor size, operating time, and other clinical features. RESULTS SILS resection was performed on 19 patients, whereas 20 patients had conventional laparoscopic resection. Compared with the conventional laparoscopic group, the operative time for the SILS group was shorter, but the time for recovery of gastrointestinal function and postoperative hospital stay for the SILS group was similar to that of the conventional laparoscopic group. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded in either group. CONCLUSION Compared with the conventional laparoscopic procedure, SILS in gastric stromal tumors is as feasible and safe when performed by experienced surgeons.

The world is currently changing due to COVID-19, and the field of dentistry is no stranger to this. The care of patients in the dental office involves very strict biosafety protocols, and patients must be aware of the protection barriers implemented to allow satisfactory, safe dental care. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and analyze the management of the current biosafety standards for dental patients since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. A bibliographic search of the main sources of information including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Science Direct, SCIELO and Google Scholar was carried out. Articles published without language restriction, systematic reviews, literature reviews and observational studies were included. We identified the biosafety measures which must be taken before, during and after dental practice following the arrival of COVID-19, The main measures include telephone triage, temperature taking on arrival at the office, the organization of the waiting room, washing hands before entering the office, knowing the auxiliary radiographic exams of choice and what type of treatment can be performed, albeit with restrictions. In conclusion, dental patients must comply with all the biosafety measures established by international protection standards and implemented by dentists before, during and after dental practice, in order to reduce the possibility of COVID-19 infection.

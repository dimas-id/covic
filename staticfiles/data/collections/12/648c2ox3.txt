Knowledge of infectious diseases now emerging from genomic, proteomic, epidemiological and clinical data can provide insights into the mechanisms of immune function, disease pathogenesis and epidemiology. Here, we describe how considerable advances in computational methods of data mining, mathematical modeling in epidemiology and simulation have been used to enhance our understanding of infectious agents and discuss their impact on the discovery of new therapeutics and controlling their spread.

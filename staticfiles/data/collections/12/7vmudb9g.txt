We report on a case of an infected urachal remnant successfully treated via a single-incisional laparoscopic technique. An 18-year-old woman was diagnosed with an infected urachal remnant. The center of the umbilicus was pulled and inverted from the skin, and the cephalic side of the urachus was dissected from the umbilicus. A single-incision laparoscopic technique employing ultrasonic coagulating shears was used to dissect the urachal remnant from the stump of the umbilicus to the caudal end. Single-incision laparoscopic excision of the urachal remnant can be used successfully as a minimally invasive technique with optimal cosmetic outcomes.

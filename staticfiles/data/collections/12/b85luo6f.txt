OBJECTIVES Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) in pediatric patients has emerged as a viable alternative to standard laparoscopy. The aim of our investigation was to assess different surgical approaches for LESS, stratifying by weight. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From March 2010 to April 2012 LESS was performed in 42 children. Children weighing below 10 kg underwent LESS through an umbilical incision using two 3-mm trocars and one 5-mm trocar. Patients above 10 kg were operated on using a metal multiuse single-site single port (X-Cone; Karl Storz Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany). Conventional straight laparoscopic instruments were used in all cases. RESULTS Mean age at operation was 100 months (range, 0.25-207 months), and mean weight was 27 kg (range, 3.1-82 kg). Median operating time was 74 minutes (range, 36-300 minutes). Eighteen children underwent LESS using two 3-mm trocars and one 5-mm trocar; 1 case required two 5-mm trocars and one 10-mm trocar. Twenty-three patients were operated on with the multiuse device. All operations were carried out safely in a standard laparoscopic transperitoneal technique with full achievement of the surgical target. In none of the patients was an intraoperative complication noticed. Postoperatively two complications were noted, which resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS LESS for pediatric patients can be done safely and efficiently with even less trauma than in conventional laparoscopy irrespective of age and weight. However, different surgical approaches have to be considered as disposable single-site ports are not available for infants and small children. To decrease operative expenses, conventional multiuse trocars and a multiuse single-site port were used with conventional laparoscopic instruments.

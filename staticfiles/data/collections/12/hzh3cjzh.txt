Abstract Cyclophilins (Cyps) are ubiquitous proteins that effect the cis–trans isomerization of Pro amide bonds, and are thus crucial to protein folding. CypA is the most prevalent of the ∼19 human Cyps, and plays a crucial role in viral infectivity, most notably for HIV-1 and HCV. Cyclophilins have been shown to play key roles in effective replication of a number of viruses from different families. A drug template for CypA inhibition is cyclosporine A (CsA), a cyclic undecapeptide that simultaneously binds to both CypA and the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CN), and can attenuate immune responses. Synthetic modifications of the CsA scaffold allows for selective binding to CypA and CN separately, thus providing access to novel, non-immunosuppressive antiviral agents.

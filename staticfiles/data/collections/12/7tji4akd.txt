Context The role of the laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLLS) is debatable, and Level-1 data are lacking. Aims The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this approach. Settings and Design This was a retrospective study. Subjects and Methods From 2007 to 2014, patients undergoing LLLS were identified from two institutions. Statistical Analysis Used Continuous variables were compared between groups with Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate by type of distribution. Categorical variables were compared with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, depending on the number of observations. Results Thirty-eight patients were included in the study. The mean age was 63.5 + 13 years (range, 31-89), and the mean number of tumours was 1.7 + 1.5. Eleven (29%) patients underwent LLS combined with an additional liver resection (combined resections group). The mean duration of the operation and the mean estimated blood loss were significantly decreased in the LLS group compared to the combined resection group (101 + 71 min vs. 208 + 98 min and 216 + 217 ml vs. 450 + 223 ml; P < 0.05 for both, respectively). The major complications rate was 8% and no mortality occurred. Conclusions In a subset of carefully selected cases, LLLS may provide the benefits of laparoscopy. This does not appear to compromise perioperative morbidity rates. We believe that this approach may serve as a training platform for surgical trainees.

To curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we characterize the virucidal activity of long-acting Povidone Iodine (PVP-I) compositions developed using an in-situ gel forming technology. The PVP-I gel forming nasal spray (IVIEW-1503) and PVP-I gel forming ophthalmic eye drop (IVIEW-1201) rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2, inhibiting the viral infection of VERO76 cells. No toxicity was observed for the PVP-I formulations. Significant inactivation was noted with preincubation of the virus with these PVP-I formulations at the lowest concentrations tested. It has been demonstrated that both PVP-I formulations can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 virus efficiently in both a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner. These results suggest IVIEW-1503 and IVIEW-1201 could be potential agents to reduce or prevent the transmission of the virus through the nasal cavity and the eye, respectively. Further studies are needed to clinically evaluate these formulations in early-stage COVID-19 patients.

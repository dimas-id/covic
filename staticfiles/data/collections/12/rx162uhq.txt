BACKGROUND The authors introduce the dual-incision laparoscopic splenectomy (DILS) technique using a specially designed multichannel trocar and report on the surgical outcomes and operative cost of DILS compared with conventional laparoscopic splenectomy (CLS). MATERIAL AND METHODS The medical records of 53 patients who underwent a laparoscopic splenectomy using CLS with four trocars and DILS at our institution were analyzed. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in operative time between the two groups and the intraoperative transfusion rate of red blood cell substitution was not different between the two groups. In terms of postoperative pain score, hospital stay, and overall complication rate, there were no differences between the two groups. Operative cost was significantly lower in the DILS group compared with the CLS group. CONCLUSIONS DILS is a feasible and cost-effective modality of reduced port surgery in laparoscopic splenectomy.

Thoracoscopic partial pulmonary resection for small peripheral nodules without using a stapler has been introduced to our hospital. After partial resection was performed with electrocautery, two different methods of surface sealing were used: a coagulation method (C method) with Soft Coagulation alone, and a coagulation-suturing method (CS method) with Soft Coagulation combined with continuous suturing. The clinical outcomes of the two methods were retrospectively compared in this study. The C method was used in 19 lesions of 18 cases, and the CS method was used in 20 lesions of 19 cases. Primary lung cancer was the most frequent diagnosis (22 lesions of 21 cases). There were no differences between the two groups in the size and depth of the lesions. Operative time was longer with the CS method than with the C method. Postoperative air leakage was a complication in 4 cases with the C method, and one of them required re-do surgery, whereas only one case with the CS method had temporary air leakage. Postoperative computed tomography showed cavitation in 3 C method cases and 5 CS method cases, all without related symptoms. There were no local recurrences at resected sites. In conclusion, the C method was technically easy to perform, but air leakage may be prolonged after surgery. The CS method may have the advantage of causing less air leakage than the C method, but mastering the technique is important to shorten operative time.

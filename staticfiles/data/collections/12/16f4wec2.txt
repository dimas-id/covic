We investigated circulation of coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and influenza A viruses in eight seabird species of the southwestern Indian Ocean. Viruses were not detected by real-time polymerase chain reactions in the 338 tested cloacal swab samples, supporting that they did not circulate in the studied colonies at the time of sampling.

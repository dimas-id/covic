We examined data on the progression of COVID-19 epidemics in four regions in northern Italy. Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont had an extremely steeper increase in mortality with increasing number of tests performed than Veneto, which applied a policy of broader swab testing. This suggests that the strategy adopted in Veneto, similar to that in South Korea, is effective in containing COVID-19 epidemics and should be applied in other regions of Italy and countries in Europe.

Background: The role of respiratory viruses (RV) in children with cancer having febrile neutropenic episodes has not been well studied. The objectives of our study were to investigate the prevalence and clinical outcomes of Respiratory viral infection (RVI). Methods: Children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN) having acute respiratory infections (ARI) were considered as cases and febrile neutropenic cancer patients without ARI were considered as controls. A throat swab sample was obtained for the detection of 21-respiratory pathogens. Results: A total of 81 episodes of FN in cases and 37 episodes of FN in controls were included. Prevalence of RVI (at least 1 RV) was seen in 76.5% of cases and 48.6% of controls (p = 0.005). The mixed-respiratory viruses (co-infections of â‰¥2 viruses) were seen only in cases (26%) (p = 0.00). Rhinovirus (36.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13.6%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Median duration of fever before presentation was more in cases with RVI compared to without RVI [2 (1-5) days vs 1 (1-5) day (p = 0.012)]. The median total duration of febrile period was 4 (IQR, 3-6) days in cases with RVI and 3 (IQR, 1-4) days in cases without RVI (p = 0.005). The median duration of antibiotic days were longer in cases with RVI as compared to patients without RVI [9 (IQR, 7-17) days vs 7 (IQR, 6-10) days (p = 0.046)] respectively. Conclusion: There was high prevalence of RVI in children with cancer and FN; more in association with ARI. The RVI were associated with prolonged febrile period and days of antibiotics therapy.

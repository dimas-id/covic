PURPOSE: This study reports and analyzes the findings from the responses of 192 neurologists in the United States and Canada to a new survey instrument distributed in April 2020 to assess NMO practice and prescribing changes during the Covid19 pandemic. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: 92% of responding neurologists considered their NMO patients to be at an elevated risk of acquiring Covid19. They also indicated sharp declines in visits, delays in treatment and related services, and several unmet needs deterring treatment. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for evidence-based, comprehensive guidelines for treating NMO patients amid healthcare crises moving forward.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) was reported in Wuhan, China. A hyperinflammatory immune response, or cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is observed in critically unwell patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 globally. Severe lymphopenia, hyperactivated pro‐inflammatory T cells(1) and decreased regulatory T cells(2) are seen in these critically ill patients, suggesting dysregulated immune responses.

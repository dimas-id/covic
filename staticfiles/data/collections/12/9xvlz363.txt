BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic surgery (SPLS) has evolved as an alternative method to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of SPLS compared to CLS in the treatment of rectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospectively collected data of patients who had undergone either CLS (n = 194) or SPLS (n = 36) for rectal cancer in the period between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Median operative time was higher in patients with SPLS (p = 0.01), but the median operative blood loss was significantly lower (p = 0.006). No significant difference was found in intraoperative- (p = 0.14) or postoperative complication rate (p = 0.4) or 30-day mortality (p = 0.62). A tendency towards fewer late complications in the SPLS-group was seen (11.1% vs. 25.3%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.084). CONCLUSION SPLS for rectal cancer is a safe method in a selected group of patients. Further studies are needed to confirm the benefits of SPLS. Operative time is longer, but the intraoperative blood loss is reduced.

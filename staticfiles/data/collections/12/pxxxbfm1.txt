In this study, the standard laparoscopic technique versus the single-port approach was evaluated for the excision of benign gastric tumors using tissue-sparing laser-supported diaphanoscopy for localization. The first group consisted of 10 patients suffering from benign gastric tumors treated by standard laparoscopic resection. The second group included 10 patients treated using the single-port technique. All procedures were successfully completed. Histopathologic examination confirmed 15 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, 3 cases of lipoma, 1 case of leiomyoma, and 1 case of high-grade dysplasia. There was no statistically significant difference for the operation times between both groups. Comparison of the largest and smallest resection margins achieved using the standard laparoscopic technique and single-port techniques showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. During follow-up, all patients were evaluated using the total body image and cosmesis questionnaire. Although scores of all body-image functions were similar, independent of laparoscopic technique, scores of all cosmetic functions in patients operated using the single-port technique showed a statistically significant higher degree of satisfaction with the scar (P<0185). The postoperative pain scores evaluated by the visual analog scale score were not significantly different between 2 groups. The single-port technique was found to be a feasible option for the resection of submucosal or mucosal tumors. However, this method is not intended to replace standard laparoscopic resections.

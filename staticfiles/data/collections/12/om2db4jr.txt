OBJECTIVE To explore the clinical effect and adverse reactions of Strychnos nux-vomica in bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS A total of 19 MM patients with BIPN were enrolled and Nux Vomica Capsule (NVC, 0.4 g, thrice daily) were orally administrated for 30 days. Comparative analysis on parameters between pre- and post-therapy, including peripheral neuropathy (PN) grade, neurotoxicity score, Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome score, total neuropathy score (TNS), coagulation function, and serum nerve growth factor (NGF) levels were conducted. The adverse events were monitored. RESULTS In BIPN of MM patients who received NVC, PN grade was lowered, neurotoxicity score was obviously decreased (Pâ©½0.01), and both CM syndrome score and TNS were remarkably decreased (P<0.01). After the therapy, activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged (P<0.01) and fibrinogen was declined (P<0.05), showing improvement in the hypercoagulable state of patients. No significant difference of NGF recovery degrees was detected between pre- and post-therapy (P>0.05). No evident adverse reactions were observed during the course of treatment. CONCLUSION Strychnos nux-vomica L. has significantly effect with a good safety in treatment of BIPN in MM patients.

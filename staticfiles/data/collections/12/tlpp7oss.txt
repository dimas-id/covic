Abstract There is a new paradigm that preventing tuberculosis (TB) and addressing the reservoir of latent TB infection in combination with curing all TB cases is essential to accelerate the decline of TB rates and ending TB by 2050. However, complacency and incremental change eludes radical policy transformation needed to meet global targets. This essay explores current attitudes, policy disparities between high and lower burden settings, and what changes are needed to remove the obstacles to progress.

Near patient detection of viral infection represents a powerful approach for the control of emerging threats to global health. Moreover, the ability to identify individuals who have contracted the disease and developed antibodies that confer immunity is central to a return to normal daily activities. This review presents some of the recent advances in electrochemical sensors for the detection of viruses and their associated antibody profiles. Given the speed, portability, sensitivity and selectivity achieved using electrochemical detection, these sensor systems hold the promise of transformative change in clinical practice.

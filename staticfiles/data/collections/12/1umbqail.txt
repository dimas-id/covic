All sectors of livestock production are in the process of shifting from small populations on many farms to large populations on fewer farms. A concurrent shift has occurred in the number of livestock moved across political boundaries. The unintended consequence of these changes has been the appearance of multifactorial diseases that are resistant to traditional methods of prevention and control. The need to understand complex animal health conditions mandates a shift toward the collection of longitudinal animal health data. Historically, collection of such data has frustrated and challenged animal health specialists. A promising trend in the evolution toward more efficient and effective livestock disease surveillance is the increased use of aggregate samples, e.g. bulk tank milk and oral fluid specimens. These sample types provide the means to monitor disease, estimate herd prevalence, and evaluate spatiotemporal trends in disease distribution. Thus, this article provides an overview of the use of bulk tank milk and pen-based oral fluids in the surveillance of livestock populations for infectious diseases.

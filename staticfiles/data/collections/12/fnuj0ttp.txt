Due to the high perceived risk, it is critical to foster users’ initial trust in the promotion of mobile online health community (MOHC) adoption. The present study focused on the role of two different trust elements and examined the initial trust building process based on elaboration likelihood model and trust transfer theory. The results indicated that initial trust in MOHC context was composed of two interrelated components: health service provider (doctor) and underlying technology (MOHC platform). Especially, the initial trust in MOHC platform exerted greater effects on adopting intention. Both performance-based cue (doctors’ information quality and interaction quality) and transfer-based cue (trust in the offline doctors’ health service) positively shaped the initial trust in doctor. Meanwhile, only the performance-based cue (MOHC platform’s information quality and service quality) has significant positive association with initial trust in MOHC platform. However, interpersonal recommend is insignificantly related to the initial trust in doctor. Trust in the mobile internet service is insignificantly related to the initial trust in MOHC platform.

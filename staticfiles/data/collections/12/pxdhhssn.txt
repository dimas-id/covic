This chapter highlights the discovery of marine natural products with therapeutic potential. Deep water collections have been made by dredging and trawling. These are both cost-effective collection methods if the substratum does not cause damage to or snag the gear. There are several disadvantages to these approaches. It is difficult to photograph the organisms in their habitat, and encrusting organisms or organisms that grow in crevices, under ledges, or on steep rock faces cannot be easily collected unless the hard substrate that supports the organism is collected as well; dredging and trawling put all collected samples in close contact with each other and therefore, some organisms may chemically contaminate others because of exudations or secretions of various compounds and the environmental impact of dredging or trawling can be detrimental because the sampling is nonselective and habitats can be damaged or destroyed. A controversial facet of marine-derived microorganisms is their putative role with respect to the origin of bioactive natural products from marine macroorganismâ€“microorganisms associations. Symbiotic microorganisms have been repeatedly suggested as being the direct or indirect sources of bioactive metabolites in marine sponges and other invertebrates, tunicates, and bryozoans.

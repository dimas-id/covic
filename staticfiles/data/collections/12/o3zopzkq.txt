The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the cause of avian infectious bronchitis (IB). IB is one of the most highly contagious diseases, which results in many economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. The nature of this virus is such that it generates new genotypes continuously. Proper vaccination is the most suitable way of combatting IB. One of the novel genotypes of IBV, which has been circulating in the Middle Eastern countries, is the variant 2 (IS-1494/GI-23) genotype. This study aims to design and produce an autogenous variant 2 vaccines. After isolation and characterization of the Iranian variant 2, the inactivated vaccine was formulated according to the OIE guidelines, and its different aspects (Purity, titration, inactivation, immunization) were evaluated. The designed vaccine passed all of OIE quality control standards. In the assessment process, the protection rate in the groups receiving the variant 2 and commercial vaccines was 67 % and 60 %, respectively. Although the differences were not significant, they indicated better protection, and the viral load in the feces and the kidney of the group receiving the variant 2 vaccine was lower than that in the commercial vaccine. It is suggested that the variant2 strain should be added as one of the local strains to the commercial inactivated vaccines in areas affected by this genotype. The use of this vaccine in layer and breeder flocks can help to protect them against variant 2 during the production phase. Also, the transfer of maternal antibodies to offspring can provide strain-specific immunity for one-day-old chickens.

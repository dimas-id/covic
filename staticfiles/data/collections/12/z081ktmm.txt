A new type of coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), which can be found in humans and animals, with many varieties and clinical symptoms, was first seen in Wuhan, China in late 2019, under the name novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the literature, cutaneous symptoms related to the disease are generally emphasized. However, it is not yet known whether this new SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has entered our lives, plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of dermatological diseases. The patients who were admitted to the dermatology outpatient clinic between 1 April and 15 May 2019, and on 1 April and 15 May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed by searching the hospital automation system and patient files. The reason for the same months to be included in the study was to exclude seasonal effects on the diseases. After pandemic, the number of patients with Pityriasis rosea and Kawasaki disease increased significantly in patients who applied to the dermatology outpatient clinic. Our study is the first study showing Pityriasis rosea increase during the pandemic period. We think that this increase is related to HHV-6 reactivation. Herein, we wanted to draw attention to two diseases in which Human Herpes 6 (HHV-6) was accused in etiopathogenesis: Kawasaki disease and Pityriasis rosea.

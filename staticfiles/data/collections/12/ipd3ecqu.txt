An increasingly popular class of software known as participatory sensing, or mobile crowdsensing, is a means of collecting people’s surrounding information via mobile sensing devices. To avoid potential undesired side effects of this data analysis method, such as privacy violations, considerable research has been conducted over the last decade to develop participatory sensing that looks to preserve privacy while analyzing participants’ surrounding information. To protect privacy, each participant perturbs the sensed data in his or her device, then the perturbed data is reported to the data collector. The data collector estimates the true data distribution from the reported data. As long as the data contains no sensing errors, current methods can accurately evaluate the data distribution. However, there has so far been little analysis of data that contains sensing errors. A more precise analysis that maintains privacy levels can only be achieved when a variety of sensing errors are considered.

INTRODUCTION Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is established in many procedures but not in bariatric surgery. One explanation may be that SILS is technically demanding in morbidly obese patients. This report describes our technique and experience with single incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (SILAGB). METHODS Prospective data collection was performed on consecutive obese patients who underwent SILAGB between November 2009 and February 2011. A single 3 cm transverse incision in the right upper quadrant was used for a Covidien SILSâ„¢ multichannel access port. The technique is described with a standard pars flaccida approach and the 'tips and tricks' needed for a wide range of candidates using standard laparoscopic equipment. RESULTS A total of 29 patients (27 female) with a median body mass index of 41 kg/m(2) (range: 35-52 kg/m(2)) and median age of 44 years (range: 22-57 years) underwent SILAGB. There were no 'conversions' to a standard laparoscopic technique. Two cases required the addition of one single 5 mm port. The only complications were two postoperative wound infections (one with a port site infection requiring replacement of the port) and one faulty band requiring replacement. There were therefore two returns to theatre and no 30-day deaths. All patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. In this series, operative times reduced significantly to be comparable with the conventional laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSIONS SILAGB is safe and feasible in the morbidly obese. Proficiency in this technique using conventional laparoscopic equipment can be achieved with a short learning curve.

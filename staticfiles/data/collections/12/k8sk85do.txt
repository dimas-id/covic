Radical parametrectomy is indicated in cases of undiagnosed early-stage invasive cervical carcinoma discovered after simple hysterectomy performed for a presumed benign disease process. This radical surgical procedure is rarely performed for benign disease; however, there are some benign conditions such as endometriosis or ovarian remnant syndrome which may require wide excision, including parametria. Traditionally, radical parametrectomy has been performed via laparotomy; however, a minimally invasive approach via laparoscopy has been reported to be feasible and safe. Here we describe the robotic surgical approach to radical parametrectomy.

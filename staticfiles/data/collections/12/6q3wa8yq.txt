Incarcerated groin hernia is a common surgical emergency. However, reports of incarcerated femoral hernia treated with elective totally extraperitoneal repair are extremely rare. A 62-year-old woman visited our hospital with lower abdominal pain and bulging from a right groin lesion. The patient was diagnosed as having right incarcerated femoral hernia containing greater omentum by computed tomography. As there were no clear findings of intestinal obstruction and peritonitis, elective surgery was performed. Intraoperatively, the hernia sac had herniated into the right femoral canal. We could release the hernia sac using laparoscopic forceps. After reduction of the hernia sac, polypropylene mesh was placed in the preperitoneal space and fixed to Cooper's ligament. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged 3 days after surgery. We consider elective totally extraperitoneal repair for incarcerated femoral hernia to be an effective procedure for selected patients who have been diagnosed accurately.

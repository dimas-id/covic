The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a sense of unease in the rheumatology community about the risk to patients with immune-mediated diseases, given their predisposition to infection due to underlying disease states and immunosuppressive therapies. Thus far, there have been few cases of COVID-19 reported in patients with immune-mediated diseases and there have been no formal guidelines released on the management of patients with immune-mediated diseases in the setting of COVID-19. Results of clinical trials and data from the Global Rheumatology Alliance registry are eagerly awaited to gain further insight into the impact of this novel infection on our vulnerable patient population.

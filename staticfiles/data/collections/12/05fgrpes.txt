Delivering polynucleotides into animals has been a major challenge facing their success as therapeutic agents. Given the matured understanding of antibody‐mediated delivery techniques, it is possible to rationally design delivery vehicles that circulate in the blood stream and are specifically delivered into target organs. If the targeting moiety is designed to contain the cargo of an RNAi mediator without impacting its paratope, directed delivery can be achieved. In this article, we review the state of art in delivery technology for RNA mediators and address how this technique could soon be used to enhance the efficacy of the numerous small RNA therapeutic programs currently under evaluation.

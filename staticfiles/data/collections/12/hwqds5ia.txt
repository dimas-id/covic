BACKGROUND Morgagni hernias are rare, with a reported incidence of 2% to 5% of congenital diaphragmatic hernias. OBJECTIVES To review a laparoscopic technique to repair Morgagni hernias in pediatric patients. METHODS Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent minimally invasive repair of a Morgagni hernia from November 2009 to September 2017 within a defined population. RESULTS During an 8-year period, 15 patients with Morgagni hernias were identified. Four patients with Morgagni hernias were excluded because they had open repairs. Eleven Morgagni hernias were repaired through a completely minimally invasive approach. Three repairs were completed using a soft-tissue patch (Gore-Tex patch, W L Gore & Associates Inc, Flagstaff, AZ). All minimally invasive repairs were completed with transfascial sutures using an endoscopic suturing device (Endo Close, Covidien/Medtronic, Fridley, MN) and 2-0 nonabsorbable synthetic sutures with extracorporeal knot tying. Median follow-up was 40 months (range = 2.6 months to 7.3 years). No patients had postoperative pectus excavatum defects. There were no recurrences. CONCLUSION Morgagni hernias are amenable to minimally invasive repair with this simple technique. With large defects, synthetic patches should be used. Recurrences are rare, and morbidity is low.

The approach to local excision of benign and early-stage, well-selected neoplasms of the rectum continues to evolve. We demonstrate here that local excision of a rectal neoplasm using the da Vinci Robotic Surgical System can be successfully performed. To our knowledge, this is the first time robotic transanal surgery (RTS) has been used in this manner.

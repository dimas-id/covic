A dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using protein A-peroxidase was evaluated as a diagnostic test for canine leishmaniasis. The test results were in agreement with parasitologic diagnosis and indirect immunofluorescence assay results. The sensitivity of the test calculated on 31 dogs with positive parasitologic examination was 90% when a titer of 1/800 was established as a cutoff and 100% when a titer of 1/400 was established. The specificity calculated on the canine population from nonendemic areas was 100% when both titers were established. Nevertheless, in endemic areas titers near the cutoff need careful interpretation. The results of this study demonstrate that dot-ELISA protein A using a bio-dot apparatus is highly suitable for seroepidemiologic field work.

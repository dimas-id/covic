Background Single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) was introduced into bariatric surgery by Sanchez-Pernaute et al. as an advancement of the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Aim To evaluate the SADI-S procedure with regard to weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and complication rate in the super obese population. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on initial 72 patients who underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic SADI-S between December 17th, 2013 and July 29th, 2015. Results A total of 48 female and 21 male patients were included with a mean age of 42.4±10.0 years (range, 22-67). The mean body mass index (BMI) at the time of procedure was 58.4±8.3 kg/m2 (range, 42.3-91.8). Mean length of hospital stay was 4.3±2.6 days (range, 3-24). Thirty-day readmission rate was 4.3% (n=3), due to tachycardia (n=1), deep venous thrombosis (n=1), and viral gastroenteritis (n=1). Thirty-day reoperation rate was 5.8% (n=4) for perforation of the small bowel (n=1), leakage (n=1), duodenal stump leakage (n=1), and diagnostic laparoscopy (n=1). Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 28.5±8.8 % (range, 13.3-45.0) at three months (n=28), 41.7±11.1 % (range, 19.6-69.6) at six months (n=50), and 61.6±12.0 % (range, 40.1-91.2) at 12 months (n=23) after the procedure. A total of 18 patients (26.1%) presented with type II diabetes mellitus at the time of surgery. Of these patients, 9 (50.0%) had their diabetes resolved, and six (33.3%) had it improved by 6-12 months after SADI-S. Conclusions SADI-S is a feasible operation with a promising weight loss and diabetes resolution in the super-obese population.

Improved husbandry and better knowledge of exotic pets have led to a gradual increase in the lifespan of pets such as rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils. Much of the information we have on these senior patients is derived from the laboratory animal studies and anecdotal practitioner information. While the small size of some of the patients makes blood collection problematic for hematology and organ function testing, the advent of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and other molecular diagnostics is allowing the practitioner testing of specific etiologies with the very small biologic samples available. Both radiology and ultrasonography are also very valuable diagnostic modalities.

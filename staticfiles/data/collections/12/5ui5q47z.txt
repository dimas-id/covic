During the past few years, biologic meshes, primarily evolved for routine and complex cases of abdominal wall reconstruction, have been evaluated in clinical cases and experimental models. Although there is published experience on the use of small intestine submucosa and human cadaveric dermis in hiatal hernia repair with encouraging results, porcine dermal collagen (PDC) matrix has not been subject of study to date in this patient population. A systematic review of the literature was conducted, aiming at evaluating the biomechanical characteristics of cross-linked PDC in comparison to synthetic and biologic meshes. Evidence shows that cross-linked PDC is superior to synthetic meshes in terms of incorporation, adhesion formation, and mesh fibrosis; their biodynamic and biotechnical characteristics do not seem to be superior to other bioprosthetic materials according to current data. The clinical and experimental results of cross-linked PDC implants justify their pilot clinical evaluation in hiatal hernia patients.

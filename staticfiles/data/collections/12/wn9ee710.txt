Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal communications between arteries and veins characterized radiographically by the presence of a nidus and early venous drainage. Estimation of hemorrhage risk and determination of treatment strategy rely on the location and hemodynamic properties of the AVM. This article describes modern noninvasive approaches to diagnosing and evaluating AVMs, including dynamic 4-dimensional computed tomographic and magnetic resonance angiography and perfusion imaging. The role and latest advances in digital subtraction angiography and intraoperative imaging are also described.

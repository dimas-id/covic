Diarrhea is a frequent and complex entity which is caused by a large number of infectious and non-infectious reasons. A detailed clinical and epidemiological history will define whether an additional laboratory work-up and treatment is indicated. Acute diarrhea is predominantly caused by viral or bacterial pathogens and is usually of short duration without any therapeutic intervention. A parasitic or non-infectious cause must be primarily considered if the diarrhea persists over two weeks. Work-up of stool specimens must target the most likely pathogens or other causes considered. The key element of treatment of acute diarrhea is rehydration. An empirical anti-infective therapy may be considered in critically ill patients, persistent or chronic diarrhea as well as in selected epidemiological or risk situations.

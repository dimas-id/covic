Vitamin D3 (VD3) deficiency increases DNA damage, while supplementation may exert a pro-oxidant activity, prevent viral infections and formation of tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of VD3 alone or in combination with doxorubicin (DXR) using the Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test and the Epithelial Tumor Test, both in Drosophila melanogaster. For better understanding of the molecular interactions of VD3 and receptors, in silico analysis were performed with molecular docking associated with molecular dynamics. Findings revealed that VD3 alone did not increase the frequency of mutant spots, but reduced the frequency of mutant spots when co-administered with DXR. In addition, VD3 did not alter the recombinogenic effect of DXR in both ST and HB crosses. VD3 alone did not increase the total frequency of tumor, but significantly reduced the total frequency of tumor when co-administered with DXR. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics between calcitriol and Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) showed a stable interaction, indicating the possibility of signal transduction between VD3 and EcR. In conclusion, under these experimental conditions, VD3 has modulatory effects on the mutagenicity and carcinogenicity induced by DXR in somatic cells of D. melanogaster and exhibited satisfactory interactions with the EcR.

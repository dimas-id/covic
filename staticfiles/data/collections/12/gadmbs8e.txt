The COVID-19 crisis has nakedly exposed the problems and huge holes in the health care system of the United States. For today, we need to address the current pandemic from the point of view of both control and suppression. But such efforts could also provide insights into a post-pandemic restructuring of health care. If one or several states succeed in addressing the COVID pandemic together with an associated modest economic resurgence, citizens could develop the trust in state leadership necessary to finally make fundamental changes in our health care system. Such change is a once in a century opportunity.

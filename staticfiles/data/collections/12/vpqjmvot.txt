Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive method for examining the gastrointestinal tract which has been successful in small intestine studies. Recently, VCE has been attempted in the colon. However, the capsule often tumbles in the wider colonic lumen, resulting in missed regions. Self-stabilizing VCE is a novel method to visualize the colon without tumbling. The aim of the present study was to comparatively quantify the effect of stabilization of a commercially available nonmodified capsule endoscope (CE) MiroCam and its modified self-stabilizing version in acute canine experiments. Two customized MiroCam CEs were reduced in volume at the nonimaging back-end to allow the attachment of a self-expanding, biocompatible stabilizing device. Four mongrel dogs underwent laparotomy and exteriorization of a 15-cm segment of the proximal descending colon. A single CE, either self-stabilizing or nonmodified was inserted through an incision into the lumen of the colon followed by pharmacologically induced colonic peristalsis. The inserted capsule was propelled distally through the colon and expelled naturally through the anus. Novel signal processing method was developed to quantify the video stabilization based on camera tracking a predetermined target point (locale). The average locale trajectory, the average radius movement of the locale, and the maximum rate of change of the locale for sequential images were significantly lower for the stabilized capsules compared to the nonstabilized ones . The feasibility of self-stabilized capsule endoscopy has been demonstrated in acute canine experiments.

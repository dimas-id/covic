Necessary procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Providing ECT has been considered an essential service during COVID-19 in the Singapore healthcare system, not least to contribute to disease control within a society in part due to the nature of the ECT patient population. There is limited evidence-based scientific information available regarding a procedural framework for ECT during a respiratory pandemic, when much attention in the healthcare system is focused on different areas of clinical care.

This approach can be adopted in whole or in part to assist practitioners to protect the patient and themselves during the procedure.

In our previous study, the remarkable analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the combination of sodium ferulate (SF) and oxymatrine (OMT) had been found. In this study, we investigated the effect of the combination of SF and OMT on acute lung injury using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model. The cell counting and the protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured. The animal lung edema degree was evaluated by wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio. The superoxidase dismutase (SOD) activity and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed by SOD and MPO kits, respectively. The levels of inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The data showed that treatment with the combination of SF and OMT markedly attenuated inflammatory cell numbers and protein concentration in the BALF and improved SOD activity and inhibited MPO activity compared to LPS group. Moreover, the combination significantly inhibited the production of CRP and TNF-α in lung homogenate. The histological changes of the lungs were also more significantly improved by the combination. At the same dose, the obvious protective effect was not found in SF or OMT-treated alone group except that the protein concentration slightly decreased in SF group. The results indicated that the combination SF and OMT had a protective effect on LPS-induced ALI in mice, and the effect was much better than that of SF or OMT used alone.

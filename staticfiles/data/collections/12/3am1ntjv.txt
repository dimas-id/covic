Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of Coronavirus, which causes severe watery diarrhea in piglets with high morbidity and mortality. ROS and p53 play key roles in regulating many kinds of cell process during viral infection, however, the exact function in PEDV-induced apoptosis remains unclear. In this study, the pro-apoptotic effect of PEDV was examined in Vero cells and we observed that PEDV infection increased MDM2 and CBP, promoted p53 phosphorylation at serine 20 and, promoted p53 nuclear translocation, leading to p53 activation in Vero cells. Treatment with the p53 inhibitor PFT-Î± could significantly inhibit PEDV-induced apoptosis. We also observed PEDV infection induced time-dependent ROS accumulation. Treatment with antioxidants, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), significantly inhibited PEDV-induced apoptosis. Moreover, further inhibition tests were established to prove that p53 was regulated by ROS in PEDV-induced apoptosis. In addition, we also found that p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK were activated in PEDV-infected Vero cells. However, treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the SAPK/JNK inhibitor SP600125 reversed PEDV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that activated p53 and accumulated ROS participated in PEDV-induced apoptosis and p53 could be regulated by ROS during PEDV infection. Activated p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK exerted no influence on PEDV-induced apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into the function of p53 and ROS in the interaction of PEDV with Vero cells.

AIM To determine the etiological profiles of lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) in neonates during respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) season, and to define the clinical features of RSV-related infection and others. METHODS The retrospective study included newborn infants who were hospitalized for LRI during the two consecutive RSV seasons, and then tested for possible etiological agent by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. All relevant data were reviewed, and the clinical characteristics of RSV-related infection were compared to those of others. RESULTS Of 224 patients, 160 (71 %) were positive for at least one potentially causative agent. Of them, 65 % had RSV, and 15 % had more than on ecausative agent (co-infection). The RSV group had more the findings of respiratory distress (p< 0.01), abnormal chest radiography (p< 0.01), need for intensive care (p< 0.01), and duration of oxygen requirement (p< 0.01) but less fever on admission and duration of antibiotic use (for both, p< 0.01), and no longer hospital stay. Need of intensive care nursery was more common in patients with co-infection than others (25 % vs. 6.5 %, p< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study highlighted that RSV was the most frequent agent in neonates hospitalized for LRI during the season, with a more severe clinical course than other detected pathogens. The disease severity of RSV infection may have seemed to be increased by the presence of coinfection and abnormal chest radiography.

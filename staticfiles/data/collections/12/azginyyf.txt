The aim of the study was to detect newborns at risk for developing renal impairment, and to point out the importance of significant asimptomatic bacteriuria in perinatal period and early infancy. Severe urinary tract anomalies are very often accompanied only by asimptomatic bacteriuria in perinatal period. Three urinalysis ware done after delivery. 212 newborns with significant asimptomatic bacteriuria underwent ultrasound examination, and were followed up to three months. Those with normal findings and with passing bacteriuria in the first 2 months were excluded. Group of 52 newborns underwent radioisotope examination. Frequency of urinary tract anomalies in newborns was 34.6%. Increased risk for renal impairment had children with urinary tract anomalies in close family, urinary tract infection or bacteriuria, EPH gestosis and prepartal symptoms of febrile infection in mother, children with IUGR, strangulated umbilical cord, prolonged jaundice and attacks of peripheral cyanosis in perinatal period.

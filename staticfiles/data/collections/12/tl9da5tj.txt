Infectious bronchitis was diagnosed in 3-to-4-week-old pullets from an outbreak in a commercial flock in California. The disease was characterized by head swelling, watery discharge from the eyes and nostrils, and urates in kidneys. Mortality ranged from 1.8% to 12.5% per week. The isolation of a coronavirus from a suspension of pooled kidneys from clinically ill chickens at the fifth passage in 10-day-old chicken embryos, gross and histologic renal lesions, and seroconversion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in inoculated birds suggested that the virus isolated was a nephrotrophic strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The virus isolate was found to be a previously unrecognized serotype, based on virus neutralization tests performed in embryonated chicken eggs. Nephropathogenicity of the IBV isolate was confirmed by inoculation of the viral isolate into specific-pathogen-free chicks and demonstration of renal lesions. The isolation of nephrotropic strains of IBV has not been reported previously from poultry in California.

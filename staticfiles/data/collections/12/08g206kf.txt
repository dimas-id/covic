New technologies are urgently required for rapid surveillance of the current H5N1 avian influenza A outbreaks to gauge the potential for adaptation of the virus to the human population, a crucial step in the emergence of pandemic influenza virus strains. Owing to the species-specific nature of the interaction between the virus and host glycans, attention has recently focused on novel glycan array technologies that can rapidly assess virus receptor specificity and the potential emergence of human-adapted H5N1 viruses.

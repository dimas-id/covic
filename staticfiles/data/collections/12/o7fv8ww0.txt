To verify the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in neurons of the human spinal cord, we investigated the presence and distribution of CFTR protein and mRNA in different segments of the human spinal cord obtained from autopsies. The techniques employed included reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) to detect CFTR gene expression, in situ hybridization to detect mRNA distribution, and immunohistochemistry to detect protein distribution. The specificity of these experiments was established with extensive controls. We found widespread and abundant expression of CFTR in neurons of the human spinal cord. CFTR protein and mRNA are localized to the cytoplasm of neurons in all segments of the spinal cord but not to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)‐positive cells. CFTR is a very important molecule, acting as a chloride channel and regulating many physiological functions, including salt transport, fluid flow, and intracellular ion concentrations. Its mutation causes cystic fibrosis. Our finding of abundant CFTR in the spinal cord suggests that this molecule may be significant in the normal function and pathology of the spinal cord. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

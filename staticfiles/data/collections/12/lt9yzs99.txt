Abstract: Four members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, CEACAM1, CEACAM8, CEACAM6 and CEACAM3, recognized by CD66a, CD66b, CD66c and CD66d monoclonal antibodies (mAb), respectively, are expressed on human neutrophils. CD66a, CD66b, CD66c and CD66d mAb binding to neutrophils triggers an activation signal that regulates the adhesive activity of CD11/CD18, resulting in an increase in neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Molecular modeling of CEACAM1 using IgG and CD4 as models has been performed, and three peptides from the N‐terminal domain were found to increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. The peptides were 14 amino acids in length and were predicted to be present at loops and turns between β‐sheets. To better understand the amino acid sequences critical for this biological activity, in the present study we examined the other neutrophil CEACAMs and the highly homologous CEACAM, CEA. Molecular modeling of the N‐terminal domains of human CEACAM8, ‐6, ‐3 and CEA was performed. Twenty peptides, each 14 amino acids in length, that were homologous to the previously reported peptides from the N‐domains of CEACAM1, were synthesized and tested for their ability to alter neutrophil adhesion. Only one new peptide, from the N‐domain of CEA, was found to increase neutrophil adhesion, and this peptide differed from the corresponding CEACAM1 peptide by only a single conservative amino acid substitution. Importantly, minor amino acid differences between active and inactive homologous peptides suggest regions of these peptides that are critical for biological activity. The data suggest that the regions SMPF of peptide CD66a‐1, QLFG of peptide CD66a‐2 and NRQIV of peptide CD66a‐3 are critical for the activities of these peptides, and for the native CEACAMs.

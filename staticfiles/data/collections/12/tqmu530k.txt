BACKGROUND With technical improvement, accumulating lesions could be resected using endoscopic endonasal surgery. However, cerebrospinal fluid leakage is still a concern. Intraoperative dural defect reconstruction is critical. METHOD We developed a new knotting technique for dural closure during endoscopic skull base surgery. We presented a step-by-step description of the fascia lata inlay and autologous dural patch intermittent suturing method following cross-reinforcing principles and emphasized the key points of the novel intranasal knotting technique. CONCLUSION The new intranasal knotting and suturing technique is a feasible method to close the dura and to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

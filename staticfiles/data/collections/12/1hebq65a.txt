Coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV especially in China) replicate and divide in host cell. During this they are partly hidden from the innate immune responses although inflammatory consequences of viral replication still occur. We propose that anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins may not only restrict viral replication but can also prevent inflammatory responses in the lungs and other vital organs that are known to be part of the immuno-pathogenesis of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The combination of anti-inflammatory antiviral prostaglandins with interferons may lead to the clearance of viruses inside the growth-restricted infected cells. However, further experimental studies and clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these possible therapies.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of laparoscopic vaginal reconstruction using an ileal segment in patients with vaginal atresia, male-female transsexual patients, or patients who had vaginal cancer. METHODS A retrospective review of the records of 80 patients who underwent laparoscopic vaginoplasty between 2004 and 2007 at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, China. RESULTS Nineteen (23.8%) patients underwent total laparoscopic vaginoplasty and 61 (76.3%) underwent laparoscope-assisted vaginoplasty. There were 64 (80.0%) primary operations and 16 (20.0%) secondary operations. All of the surgeries were completed successfully and no intraoperative complications occurred. Mean follow-up time was 14 months. Postoperatively, 5 women had vaginal stenosis, while 4 women had no sexual partner during the follow-up period which meant that they could not be assessed completely. The remaining 71 patients were satisfied with their sexual lives after surgery. CONCLUSION Vaginal reconstruction performed via total laparoscopic vaginoplasty or a laparoscope-assisted technique using an ileal segment has a high success rate for a functional vagina and patient satisfaction.

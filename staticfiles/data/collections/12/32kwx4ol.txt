INTRODUCTION Lopinavir in combination with ritonavir is approved for the treatment of HIV and has recently been subject to a clinical trial in severe Covid-19. AREAS COVERED This evaluation is of LOTUS China (the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China), which was a randomised trial in hospitalised subjects with Covid-9 in a respiratory sample and pneumonia. As, in severe Covid-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no beneficial effects but increased gastrointestinal adverse effects, this combination should not be used at this stage of Covid-19. EXPERT OPINION In my opinion, the rationale for undertaking a trial of lopinavir/ritonavir in Covid-19 was poor. The analysis of a modified intention to treat group analysis in LOTUS China may have introduced bias. After LOTUS China, there is probably no future for lopinavir in the treatment of severe Covid-19, but some clinical trials for prevention or in various stages of Covid-19 have recently started or are ongoing. The major limitation to these trials is that, as lopinavir does not inhibit Covid-19, it is unlikely to prevent infection, reduce viral load, or reduce severity. However, these trials may be worthwhile in finally determining whether lopinavir has any role in preventing or treating Covid-19.

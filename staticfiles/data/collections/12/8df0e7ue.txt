Polymyxin B is an antibiotic that shows strong bactericidal activity against Gram-negative bacteria, by binding to and inactivating endotoxin. Systemic administration of polymyxin B in humans is restricted because of its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, and this compound was therefore considered a strong candidate ligand for the extracorporeal selective adsorption of circulating endotoxin in the blood. ToraymyxinÂ® is a direct hemoperfusion column that uses polymyxin B attached to an insoluble carrier to bind endotoxin in the blood. In 1994, the Japanese National Health Insurance system approved the use of Toraymyxin for the treatment of endotoxemia and septic shock. In this chapter, we will review the development, clinical use, and efficacy of Toraymyxin, examine the structure of the Toraymyxin column, and comment on the current position of Toraymyxin in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. We will also highlight some potential new applications of Toraymyxin for pulmonary diseases.

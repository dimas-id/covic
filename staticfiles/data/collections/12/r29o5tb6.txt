Objective Laparoscopic knot-tying and suturing are the most difficult steps in shortening the warm ischemia time and learning curve of laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery. This study was performed to demonstrate the safety, oncological efficacy, and technical tips of sutureless retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery (RPNSS). Methods This retrospective study included 78 cases of RPNSS using a sutureless technique and 126 cases of RPNSS using a single-layer barbed self-retaining suture technique performed from December 2012 to December 2016. Results The mean warm ischemia time was significantly shorter in the sutureless technique group than in the barbed self-retaining suture technique group (6.8 vs. 21.1 minutes, respectively). There was no significant difference in the mean age, body mass index, R.E.N.A.L. Nephrometry score, operative time, maximal tumor diameter, intraparenchymal depth, blood loss, operative time, transfusion rate, complication rate, or postoperative hospital stay between the two groups. No open conversion was needed. No positive margins or local recurrence were observed during follow-up. Conclusions The sutureless technique was proven to be safe and oncologically effective and may allow novice laparoscopic surgeons to easily and quickly master RPNSS, a technically difficult procedure.

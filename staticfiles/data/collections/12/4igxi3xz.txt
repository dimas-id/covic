Infectious diseases are an important cause of death among children under the age of 5 (Stein et al., 2004). Most of these deaths are caused by preventable or curable infections. Limited access to medical care, antibiotics, and vaccinations remains a major problem in developing countries. But infectious diseases also continue to be an important public health issue in developed countries. With the help of modern technologies, some infections have been effectively controlled; however, new diseases such as SARS and West Nile virus infections are constantly emerging. In addition, other diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and bacterial pneumonia are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial treatment.

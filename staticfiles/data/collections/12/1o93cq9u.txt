Blood, feces, nasal secretions, and tears were collected weekly from 5 randomly selected 1- to 8-week-old calves in a large commercial dairy herd. Clinical signs and bovine coronavirus (BCV) shedding from the respiratory and enteric tracts of calves were monitored through the 8-week period by direct immunofluorescence of nasal epithelial cells, protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy on feces, and ELISA on nasal secretions and feces. All samples were analyzed for antibody isotypes to BCV structural proteins by immunoblotting. All calves had BCV respiratory tract infections and 4 of 5 calves shed virus in feces. Several calves had multiple or prolonged periods of BCV respiratory tract or enteric tract shedding or both. All calves (except 1) had passive IgG1 antibodies to some BCV proteins (mainly the E2 and E3 proteins) in their serum when they were 1 week old. The presence of these passive serum antibodies (mainly to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins) was associated with decreased or delayed systemic and mucosal antibody responses in calves, in particular IgA responses in nasal secretions and tears to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins, but not to the N protein. Moderate amounts of maternal BCV E2- and E3-specific antibodies in serum did not prevent BCV enteric tract or respiratory tract infections in calves, but may have delayed the development of active antibody responses to these BCV proteins. However, calves with BCV respiratory tract or enteric tract infections had no detectable passive antibodies to any BCV proteins in nasal secretions or feces.

BACKGROUND: We assessed the current status of knowledge, perception, attitude, and role model regarding hand hygiene (HH) among infection control nurses (ICNs) and identified the factors influencing these variables. METHODS: A structured questionnaire was adapted from a World Health Organization survey. Data were collected from November 8, 2017, to February 2, 2018. RESULTS: ICNs showed the following scores (mean ± SD): knowledge (19.5 ± 2.3), perception (69.9 ± 8.9), attitude (46.9 ± 5.8), and role model (39.2 ± 6.0). HH performance of health care workers (HCWs) was 75.2 ± 15.5. Mean HH performance scores of HCWs (P = .007) differed significantly according to infection control experience (3 groups: ≤12 months, 13-24 months, >24 months). Perception, attitude, and role model scores showed positive correlations with each other (P < .01). The regression model for HH performance of HCWs was calculated as follows: Y(1) = 31.638 + 0.067X(1) (perception of ICNs) + 0.133X(2) (attitude of ICNs) + 0.825X(3) (role model of ICNs) (P < .001; adjusted R(2) = 0.115). DISCUSSION: Perception, attitude, and role model scores of ICNs were significant predictors of HH performance of HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: Specialized well-structured HH education programs should be developed for ICNs that will help improve HH performance of HCWs.

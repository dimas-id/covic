Our earlier publications showed semantic tableau admits partial exceptions to the Second Incompleteness Theorem where a formalism recognizes its self consistency and views multiplication as a 3-way relation (rather than as a total function). We now show these boundary-case evasions will collapse if the Law of the Excluded Middle is treated by tableau as a schema of logical axioms (instead of as derived theorems).

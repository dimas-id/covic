Eleven field cases of a disease characterized by severe dyspnoea or abdominal breathing were examined post mortem. The affected pigs had antibody against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The predominant lung lesions were severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia, and slight suppurative bronchopneumonia. The lesions were closely associated with the sites at which PRRSV and Mycoplasma hyorhinis antigens were detected. Four of five pigs inoculated with PRRSV developed slight pneumonitis. The fifth animal, which died of severe pneumonitis, yielded a heavy culture of M. hyorhinis. These findings demonstrate that dual infection with M. hyorhinis and PRRSV caused severe pulmonary lesions.

The spike (S) protein of a non-fusogenic murine coronavirus, MHV-2, was compared to that of a variant, MHV-2f, with fusion activity. Two amino acids differed between The S proteins of these viruses; one was located in the signal sequence (amino acid 12) and the other in the putative cleavage site (amino acid 757). To determine which one of these amino acid changes is important for the alteration of fusogenicity, chimeric S proteins between MHV-2 and -2f were constructed and expressed in DBT cells by a vaccinia virus expression system. The results revealed that one amino acid change (Ser to Arg) at position 757 is responsible for the acquisition of fusogenicity of the MHV-2f S protein. This change also altered the susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage of the MHV-2 S protein which was originally uncleavable. We concluded that the non-fusogenic activity of MHV-2 results from the lack of cleavage of its S protein.

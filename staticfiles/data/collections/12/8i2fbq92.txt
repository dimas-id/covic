Abstracts Introduction As the coronavirus pandemic swept across national and state borders, institutions of higher learning, including cytology, began closing campuses and moving instructions on-line. We described a method of remotely teaching cytology in our institution, which includes utilizing the tele-cytology concept used in Rapid Onsite Evaluations (ROSE) and using remote conferencing/educational tools to conduct eCytology learning. This is a cost-effective way to transition a traditional in-classroom program into online teaching in cytology. It can also be implemented quickly. Methods In March 2020, our cytology program developed a method for teaching cytology remotely. The distance-learning teaching method included the use of remote conferencing (Zoom) and learning management platforms (Canvas) to present lectures and administer tests. Remote multi-head sessions were conducted by adapting the tele-cytology ROSE concept which attach a mobile device to the microscope to transmit live video to remote learners. Results When asked about their experiences with online learning, students responded positively to their experiences. All students indicate a willingness to attend classes remotely in the future, even when the traditional in-classroom learning option is available. Conclusion We present a method for educating students remotely through the use of existing technology that is affordable and could be implemented quickly by nearly all cytology education programs.

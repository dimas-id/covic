Neuropathies in cats are mostly acquired. In comparison to the dog, only very few inherited forms have been described. This case report describes the clinical and diagnostic findings of a suspected inherited feline axonal neuropathy with a very unique clinical course. Two young related male Snowshoe cats were presented with an initially progressive history of recurrent pelvic limb weakness. Electrodiagnostic investigations suggested an axonopathy and muscleâ€“nerve biopsies confirmed axonal degeneration. Over the following 2 years both cats stabilised without any specific treatment, and repeat electrodiagnostic investigations and muscle biopsy in one cat confirmed the tendency for remission.

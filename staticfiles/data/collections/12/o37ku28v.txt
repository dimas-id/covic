In order to stay up to date on epidemic trends and monitor possible mutations of the virus in the wake of an outbreak, China invested nearly 400 million RMB on testing large amounts of specimens and expanding the influenza monitoring network to include 411 influenza monitoring network laboratories and 556 sentinel hospitals - a network which covered all prefectural-level cities and some priority districts and counties. All of these laboratories and hospitals were in operation by September, 2009 (see Fig. 5.1).

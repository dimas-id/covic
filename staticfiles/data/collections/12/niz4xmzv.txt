The lymphocyte populations of the bovine gut lamina proprial (LP) and epithelial tissues were isolated and characterized with respect to cells bearing surface and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig). Functional characteristics of cells from the two tissues, including responsiveness to Concanavalin A (Con A), anti-bovine immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), Con A supernatants of bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes (bConA sup) and recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2), were also assessed. Less than 1% of the mononuclear cells in the epithelial tissue (IEL) stained for cytoplasmic Ig, and 9% stained positively for surface Ig. IEL did not proliferate in response to anti-Ig, although cells of this population did respond to Con A, bConA sup, and rhIL-2. Twenty-seven percent of bovine gut LP lymphocytes stained for surface Ig, while 39% of these cells were positive for cytoplasmic Ig. LP lymphocytes proliferated in response to all four stimulants used, Con A, anti-Ig, bConA sup and rhIL-2.

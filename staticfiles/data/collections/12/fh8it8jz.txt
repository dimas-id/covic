Anesthetic management of pediatric orthopedic patients is uniquely challenging. Approach to the pediatric patient must consider heightened preoperative anxiety and its postoperative behavioral and pain effects. Frequent respiratory infections can complicate timing of surgery and anesthetic care. Perioperative pain management usually involves a multimodal pharmacologic approach with the goal of minimizing opioid requirements. Regional anesthesia is valuable for postoperative pain control. Safety of its use in the pediatric population has been confirmed in recent studies. Included for discussion are fractures, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, club foot, and scoliosis.

A nondisposable, or “hard”, multiwell microplate is described for use with small volumes of biological solutions containing organic solvents. The design of this teflon-coated, aluminum device resembles the 96-well layout of the disposable variety of tissue culture microplates. The reusable, hard microplate has been specifically developed to hold and evaporate volatile organic solvents from aliquots of crude sample extractions or partitions intended for testing in various in vitro biological screening assays. This device is a valuable adjunct for converting numerous small volumes of nonpolar or nonaqueous dissolved compounds into reconstituted solutions containing acceptable assay solvents.

Abstract Main-group element compounds were among the first developed in the modern era as pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of a wide variety of human ailments; it is now recognized that many of these elements exist in traditional medicine of many societies, for example, arsenic. The use of main-group element compounds in contemporary medicine continues for the treatment of, for example, depression (Li), stomach ulcers (Bi), cancer (As and Ga), and leishmaniasis (Sb). Not surprisingly, new compounds of these elements, and other main-group elements, continue to be investigated for their potential use in new therapies. In this chapter, the use of main-group elements as therapeutic agents is outlined and also, where understood, comments on biological targets and mechanisms of action. Further, key advances in new potential applications of main-group element compounds in medicine are evaluated.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a disease caused by a corona-virus. These viruses are long known to be human pathogens but this form is new and more virulent. It emerged in March this year in China and seemed to be apt to sweep over the world as a kind of Spanish Flu. Forunately, this didn't happen and at the moment the emerging pandemic seems to be contained. This offers hope in case a more virulent pandemic would suddenly strike in the next future. A world prepared is a difficult prey, even for a surprise virus.

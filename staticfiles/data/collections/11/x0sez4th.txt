Serum antibody analyses for bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), and bovine rotavirus (BRV) were performed on 527 randomly selected cows, before calving, and on 407 three-week-old calves. In cows and calves, BCV and BRV were the most seroprevalent viruses (80% to 100% according to virus and vaccination status). Bovine respiratory syncytial virus was the least seroprevalent in the cows, independent of the vaccination status. In nonvaccinated cows the seroprevalence to BRSV was 36.7%, and 53.5% in cows vaccinated less than two weeks prior to collecting blood, and 67.6% in cows vaccinated two weeks or more prior to blood collection. In their calves, BHV-1 was the least seroprevalent, independent of the vaccination status. The serological status and antibody titers in calves were generally associated with those of the dam. The occurrence of respiratory diseases in the calves was associated with cow and calf serological profiles (BHV-1, BRSV and BCV in the nonvaccinated group, BHV-1, BVDV and BCV in the vaccinated group). The occurrence of diarrhea was not associated with cow and calf serological profiles but was negatively associated with high level calf serum IgG in the nonvaccinated group (odds ratio = 0.73). Bovine coronavirus and BRV were shed by 1.4% and 4.9% of calves in the nonvaccinated group, and by 0% and 9.9% of calves in the vaccinated group, respectively. Bovine rotavirus shedding was associated with fecal diarrheic consistency at the moment of fecal sampling but not with previous occurrence of diarrhea.

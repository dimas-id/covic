In this study, we use the characteristic infected cluster size to investigate the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading in static and dynamic complex networks. The simulation results show that the epidemic spreads inhomogeneously in both cases. Also, the inhomogeneity of the epidemic spreading becomes smaller with increasing speed of moving individuals and almost disappears when the speed is high enough.

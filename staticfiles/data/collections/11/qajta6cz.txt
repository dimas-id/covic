A cytopathogenic coronavirus, serologically identified as porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), has recently been associated with acute outbreaks of wasting and encephalitis in nursing piglets from pig farms in southern Québec and Ontario, Canada. The 3'-terminal end of the genome of the prototype HEV-67N strain and that of the recent Québec IAF-404 field isolate, both propagated in HRT-18 cells, were sequenced. Overall, sequencing data indicated that HEV has remained antigenically and genetically stable since its first isolation in North America in 1962. Compared with the prototype strain of bovine enteropathogenic coronavirus (BCoV), HEV, as well as the human respiratory coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) showed a major deletion in their ORF4 gene. Deduced amino acid sequences for both HEV strains revealed 89/88, 80, 93/92 and 95/94% identities with the structural proteins HE, S, M and N of BCoV and HCoV-OC43, respectively. Major variations were observed in the S1 portion of the S gene of both HEV strains, with only 73/71% amino acid identities compared with those of the two other haemagglutinating coronaviruses.

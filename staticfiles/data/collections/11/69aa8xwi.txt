Ebola virus is very challenging problem of the world. The main purpose of this work is to study fractional Ebola virus model. An efficient computational method based on iterative scheme is proposed to solve fractional Ebola model numerically. Stability of proposed method is also discussed. Efficiency of proposed method is shown by listing CPU time. Proposed computational method will work for long time domain. Numerical results are presented graphically. The main reason for using this technique is low computational cost and high accuracy. It is also shown how the approximate solution varies for fractional and integer order Ebola virus model.

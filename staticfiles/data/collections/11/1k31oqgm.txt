RECENT FINDINGS The stigma attached to the management of somatic illnesses of patients with mental disorders is considered as a more recent issue of concern. Few relevant studies could be found. Medical comorbidities among people with mental disorders along with the treatment gap constitute a public-health problem. SUMMARY The stigma attached to mental disorders in general forms the basis of the stigma towards the physical health problems of these patient groups. The impact of stigma on somatic treatment and care for people with comorbid mental and somatic disorders is discussed in its context as a public-health problem.

Lymphangiosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of the lymphatic endothelium that is rare in cats. This report describes two cases of feline lymphangiosarcoma that originated in the distal limb, causing intractable lymphoedema and serosanguineous discharge with ecchymoses in local and distant sites. In association with the neoplasia, one cat had cortical bone lysis of multiple metacarpal bones of the affected limb and the other had severe immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA). The disease in both cases affected young cats and progressed rapidly. Persistent distal limb lymphoedema with serosanguineous discharge is suggestive of lymphangiosarcoma especially when local or distal ecchymoses are evident.

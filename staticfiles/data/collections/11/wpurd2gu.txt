The present state of diagnostic and therapeutic developmental race for vaccines against the SARS CoV-2 (nCOVID-19) focuses on prevention and control of this global pandemic which also represents a critical challenge to the global health community. Although development of novel vaccines can prevent the SARS CoV-2 infections, it is still impeded by several other factors and therefore novel approaches towards treatment and management of this disease is the urgent need. Passive immunotherapy plays a vital role as a possible alternative to meet this challenge and among various antibody sources, chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) can be used as an alternative to mammalian antibodies which have been previously studied against SARS CoV outbreak in China. In this review, we discuss the strategies for the use of chicken egg yolk (IgY) antibodies in the development of rapid diagnosis and immunotherapy against SARS CoV-2. Also, IgY antibodies have previously been used against various respiratory bacterial and viral infections in humans and animals. Compared to mammalian antibodies (IgG), chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) have greater binding affinity to specific antigens, ease of extraction and lower production costs, hence possessing remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity of pathogens in respiratory and lungs. We provide an overall importance for the use of monoclonal chicken egg yolk antibodies (IgY) using phage display method describing their potential passive immunotherapeutic application for the treatment and prevention of SARS CoV-2 infection which is simple, fast and safe way of approach for treating patients effectively.

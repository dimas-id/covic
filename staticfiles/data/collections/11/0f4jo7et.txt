The histamine H(4) receptor, belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, is an increasingly attractive drug target. It plays an indispensable role in many cellular pathways, and numerous H(4)R ligands are being studied for the treatment of several inflammatory, allergic, and autoimmune disorders, including pulmonary fibrosis. Activation of H(4)R is involved in cytokine production and mediates mast cell activation and eosinophil chemotaxis. The importance of this receptor has also been shown in inflammatory models: peritonitis, respiratory tract inflammation, colitis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies suggest that H(4)R acts as a modulator in cancer, neuropathic pain, vestibular disorders, and type-2 diabetes, however, its role is still not fully understood.

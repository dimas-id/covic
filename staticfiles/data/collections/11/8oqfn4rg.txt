Nowadays, the fashion industry is moving towards fast fashion, offering a large selection of garment products in a quicker and cheaper manner. To this end, the fashion designers are required to come up with a wide and diverse amount of fashion products in a short time frame. At the same time, the fashion retailers are oriented towards using technology, in order to design and provide products tailored to their consumers’ needs, in sync with the newest fashion trends. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence system which operates as a personal assistant to a fashion product designer. The system’s architecture and all its components are presented, with emphasis on the data collection and data clustering subsystems. In our use case scenario, datasets of garment products are retrieved from two different sources and are transformed into a specific format by making use of Natural Language Processes. The two datasets are clustered separately using different mixed-type clustering algorithms and comparative results are provided, highlighting the usefulness of the clustering procedure in the clothing product recommendation problem.

PURPOSE The objective of this study was to establish a reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method for rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). MATERIALS AND METHODS The HIV-1 integrase gene region was selected because it was a conserved part of the HIV-1 genome. Six primers specific to eight regions of the HIV-1 integrase gene were designed. A total of 171 samples (18 HIV-1 confirmed positive samples and 153 serum specimens were collected in this study) were tested by RT-LAMP and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). After amplification in an isothermal water bath for 45 min, samples containing HIV-1 generated the expected ladder-like products while other viruses generated no product. RESULTS The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay were evaluated by comparison with RT-PCR. The assay was significantly more sensitive than normal gel-based RT-PCR. CONCLUSION Because it is specific and simple, the RT-LAMP assay can be widely applied in clinical laboratories for rapid detection of HIV-1.

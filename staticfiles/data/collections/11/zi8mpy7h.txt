Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Bocavirus, is a recently described respiratory virus with a worldwide distribution. It is recognized as one of the most frequently detected respiratory viruses in hospitalized children below 5 years of age and mainly detected in children between 6 and 24 months of age. The severe clinical course of HBoV1 infection can be seen in prematurely born children or children, but rarely adults, with other underlying medical conditions. The seroepidemiological studies show that most of the children are infected with HBoV1 by the age of 6 and that the IgG antibodies remain for life. The routine laboratory diagnostics of HBoV1 infections is almost exclusively based on detection of HBoV1 DNA in respiratory samples by PCR. Due to frequent coinfections with other respiratory viruses, PCR of plasma samples and detection of specific IgM might aid in determining the etiology of infection.

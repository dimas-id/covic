OBJECTIVE Endothermal ablation has become a commonly used technology for occlusion of refluxing great saphenous veins (GSVs). However, the risk for primarily untreated accessory saphenous veins (ASVs) to develop reflux during follow-up has not yet been defined. Here, the prevalence and risk of ASV reflux is explored. METHODS During a prospective multicenter cohort study on radiofrequency segmental thermal ablation of refluxing GSVs, the presence and reflux status of ASVs were monitored in 93 legs in a single center. Control examinations were performed after 1 week and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Life-table and multiple regression analyses were used to describe frequency and risk factors for presence of reflux in untreated ASVs. RESULTS Of 93 legs, 82 (88%) were available for 4-year follow-up. At baseline, 43 legs (46%) had an anterior ASV detectable by duplex ultrasound, with only two legs (2%) presenting with reflux. During 4 years of follow-up, according to life-table analysis, the proportion of legs with a detectable anterior ASV increased to 71% (n = 65); 32% of all legs and 55% of legs with a detectable anterior ASV exhibited refluxing anterior ASVs. Remarkably, in 35% of all legs with an anterior ASV, this reflux presented as a source of axial reflux, suggesting hemodynamic relevance. Posterior ASVs were detected in only 10 legs during 4-year follow-up, exhibiting reflux in only two cases. CONCLUSIONS Whereas posterior ASVs were meaningless, refluxing anterior ASVs occurred in a significant proportion of legs after thermal ablation of GSVs. Whether nonrefluxing anterior ASVs should be treated at the time of GSV ablation needs further examination.

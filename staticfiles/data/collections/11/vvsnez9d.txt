The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted delivery of healthcare globally, forcing healthcare providers at all levels to adjust their methods of care. Surgeons in the community must respond accordingly and not only take necessary precautions during patient management, but also find opportunities to better educate patients moving forward. Additionally, to best preserve personal protective equipment and staffing resources, surgeons should thoroughly assess their patient load and determine which planned surgeries can be safely delayed to a later date. While not necessarily on the front lines of the pandemic response, surgeons have a vital role in maintaining the public health in the time of crisis.

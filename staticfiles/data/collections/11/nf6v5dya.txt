By 21st April 2020 COVID_19 had caused more than 2m cases across more than 200 countries. The majority of countries with significant outbreaks introduced social distancing or "lockdown" measures to reduce viral transmission. The key question now in many countries is when, how, and to what extent these measures can be lifted. By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 21st April 2020, and covered 67 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling. The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with Spain having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.71 (95%CI 0.65-0.78) based on cases and 0.81 (95%CI 0.77-0.85) based on mortality. Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.

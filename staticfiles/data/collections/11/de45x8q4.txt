BACKGROUND In December 2019, a new coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged from China causing pneumonia outbreaks first in the Wuhan region and currently worldwide. In the light of the lack of efficient and specific treatments and the need to contain the epidemic, drug repurposing appears to be the most efficient tool to find therapeutic solution. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to summarize in vitro data of current agents used for the management of SARSCoV-2 all over the world. METHODS A literature search of articles from January 2000 until April 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to assess in vitro data of current or putative therapies for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Although in vitro studies are scarce, data regarding chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, teicoplanin, ivermectin, lopinavir, homoharringtonine and emetine seem promising. CONCLUSION Scientist all over the world should work together and increase their efforts in order to find feasible and efficient solutions against this new global viral threat.

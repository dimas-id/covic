Transgenic plant-derived vaccines offer a new strategy for the development of safe, inexpensive vaccines against diarrhoeal diseases. In animal and Phase I clinical studies, these vaccines have been safe and immunogenic without the need for a buffer or vehicle other than the plant cell. This review examines some early attempts to develop oral transgenic plant vaccines against enteric infections such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection, cholera and norovirus infection.

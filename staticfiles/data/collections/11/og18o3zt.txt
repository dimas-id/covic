The present report represents the first cytogenetic description of Steindachneridion doceanum, great catfish which is currently at high extinction risk and it is listed as threatened on the red list of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment, also are suggested karyotype relationships with other species of the same genus endemic from other river basins. The results revealed a diploid number of 2n = 56 and the karyotype composed of 18 metacentric, 20 submetacentric, 10 subtelocentric and 8 acrocentric chromosomes (NF = 104). The AgNORs and CMA3 signals were coincident in location occupying the short arm of an acrocentric chromosome pair (25th), in a secondary constriction. The 5S rDNA genes were localized on the short arms of one subtelocentric pair. C-banding revealed terminal blocks on the short arms on many chromosomes as well as terminal positive bands at the both ends of a submetacentric pair. C banding also revealed a large heterochromatic block in the secondary constriction (25th) region that was coincident with the AgNORs sites and CMA3+ bright bands. In spite S. doceanum represent an endemic taxon, in spite their geographic isolation their cytogenetic characteristics show similarities with other species of the genus.(AU)

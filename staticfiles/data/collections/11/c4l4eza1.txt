Neurologists often evaluate patients whose symptoms cannot be readily explained even after thorough clinical and diagnostic testing. Such medically unexplained symptoms are common, occurring at a rate of 10%-30% among several specialties. These patients are frequently diagnosed as having somatoform, functional, factitious, or conversion disorders. Features of these disorders may include symptom exaggeration and inadequate effort. Symptom validity tests (SVTs) used by psychologists when assessing the validity of symptoms and impairments are structured, validated, and objectively scored. They could detect poor effort, underperformance, and exaggeration. In settings with appropriate prior probabilities, detection rates for symptom exaggeration have diagnostic utility. SVTs may help in moderating expensive diagnostic testing and redirecting treatment plans. This article familiarizes practicing neurologists with their merits, shortcomings, utility, and applicability in practice.

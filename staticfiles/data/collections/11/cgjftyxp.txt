OPINION STATEMENT Percutaneous thermal ablation, including microwave ablation (MWA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and cryoablation, is a well-established focal treatment option for primary and metastatic malignancies. While published literature specific to ablation of sarcomas is relatively lacking compared with non-sarcomatous malignancies, what is available is promising. In situations where a focal treatment option is desired, strong consideration should be given to percutaneous thermal ablation, in addition to surgery and radiation therapy. A significant advantage of percutaneous thermal ablation over surgery and radiation includes the repeatability of ablation, as there is no absolute limit on the number of times an ablation can be performed. Compared with surgery, ablation offers the potential of decreased recovery time, a less invasive procedure, and is often performed in patients deemed not medically fit for surgery.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Emergency physicians generally have limited exposure to internationally acquired illnesses. However, travelers can present quite ill, and delays in recognition and treatment can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. This paper aims to summarize typical presentations of common international diseases and provide the emergency physician with a practical approach based on current guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: In the treatment of travelerâ€™s diarrhea, azithromycin has become the treatment of choice due to the growing antibiotic resistance. Intravenous artesunate was approved in 2019 under investigational new drug protocol for the treatment of severe malaria, and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have become the first-line treatment for most cases of uncomplicated malaria. Since the 2015 outbreak, Zika has become a concern to many travelers, but the current treatment is supportive. SUMMARY: Clinicians should be aware of a few noteworthy updates in the treatment of internationally acquired illnesses, but more importantly, they must recognize warning signs of severe illness and treat promptly. Future research on workup and disposition could help emergency physicians identify which patients need admission in well-appearing febrile travelers.

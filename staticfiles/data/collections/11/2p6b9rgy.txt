The innate nonspecific immunity is the first line of defense against viral infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are two main receptor families detecting viral nucleic acid. So far, three RLR family members were characterized: RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2. RLR constitute a family of cytoplasmic helicases, which recognized intracellular single-stranded and double-stranded RNA that is introduced to cytosol during viral infection and replication. In this work we review the current knowledge about the mechanisms of viral recognition by RIG-I-like receptors and their signaling pathways for the activation of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines synthesis.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the main neurological manifestations related to coronavirus infection in humans. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted regarding clinical studies on cases that had neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. The search was carried out in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and LILACS with the following keywords: “coronavirus” or “Sars-CoV-2” or “COVID-19” and “neurologic manifestations” or “neurological symptoms” or “meningitis” or “encephalitis” or “encephalopathy,” following the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Seven studies were included. Neurological alterations after CoV infection may vary from 17.3% to 36.4% and, in the pediatric age range, encephalitis may be as frequent as respiratory disorders, affecting 11% and 12% of patients, respectively. The Investigation included 409 patients diagnosed with CoV infection who presented neurological symptoms, with median age range varying from 3 to 62 years. The main neurological alterations were headache (69; 16.8%), dizziness (57, 13.9%), altered consciousness (46; 11.2%), vomiting (26; 6.3%), epileptic crises (7; 1.7%), neuralgia (5; 1.2%), and ataxia (3; 0.7%). The main presumed diagnoses were acute viral meningitis/encephalitis in 25 (6.1%) patients, hypoxic encephalopathy in 23 (5.6%) patients, acute cerebrovascular disease in 6 (1.4%) patients, 1 (0.2%) patient with possible acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, 1 (0.2%) patient with acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and 2 (1.4%) patients with CoV related to Guillain-Barré syndrome. CONCLUSION: Coronaviruses have important neurotropic potential and they cause neurological alterations that range from mild to severe. The main neurological manifestations found were headache, dizziness and altered consciousness.

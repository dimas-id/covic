Alsace, in particular Haut-Rhin, is one of the main clusters of COVID-19 in France There has been a shortage of essential supplies in the area, especially alcohol-based hand sanitizer In this context, and in accordance with the decree dated March 6, 2020, our hospital management team asked us to start local production of alcohol-based handrub This was a real challenge: In one week, we had to implement the production of handrub to meet the needs of a 1,400-bed hospital The production had to comply with the French preparation guidelines and take place on specific premises, with qualified and calibrated equipment, by qualified staff, under the supervision of a pharmacist The other big challenge we faced was the supply of pharmaceutical raw and packaging materials During this particular critical period, all suppliers were out of stock Here, we describe the organizational set-up and the decisions made, e g , to use technical-grade ethanol before the publication of the decrees dated March 13 and March 23, 2020

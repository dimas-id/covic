The importance of the labrum in the biomechanics of the hip joint is well documented. Labral tears are the most common pathology in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy and therefore appropriate labral management is vital. Labral preservation has been advocated as a superior alternative to labral excision in terms of clinical outcomes. While reconstruction of the labrum is recommended for irreparable tears, labral augmentation is a viable alternative for labral function restoration under certain indications. This Technical Note will describe a method for arthroscopic hip labral augmentation using an anterior tibialis tendon allograft and the pull-through technique.

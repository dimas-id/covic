PURPOSE To evaluate laparoscopic gastric resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). METHODS From June, 2003 to October, 2009, 56 patients with gastric GIST who underwent laparoscopic gastric resection were retrospectively reviewed, and their surgical procedure, perioperative outcomes, pathology, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS All patients underwent laparoscopic gastric resection successfully, including 33 laparoscopic wedge resections, 19 laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resections, 3 laparoscopic-assisted distal gastrectomies, and 1 laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic resection. The operative approaches performed were mostly based on the tumor location. No conversions were observed. The mean operative duration was 90 minutes (30 to 210 min), blood loss was 55 mL (5 to 180 mL), time for passage of flatus was 2 days (1 to 11 d), and the postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (3 to 13 d). The resection margin was microscopic negative. After 21.5 months (6 to 76 mo) of follow-up, there was no operative recurrence and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastric resection for selective cases of gastric GISTs is safe, feasible, and effective. Laparoscopic wedge resection procedure is the first choice for most GISTs located in fundus and anterior wall, laparoscopic transgastric tumor-everting resection procedure can be used in cases with the tumor located in esophagogastric junction area and in posterior wall of the stomach as well. For antral tumors, laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy should be performed.

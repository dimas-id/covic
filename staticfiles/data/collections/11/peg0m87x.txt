CoViD-19 deaths to population size ratios fail to account for well-documented age and sex differences in CoViD-19 mortality. To assess trends across populations for which CoViD-19 deaths might not be available by age and sex, an indirect age-and-sex adjustment can still be performed. The corresponding Comparative CoViD-19 Mortality Ratio (CCMR) only requires population age and sex compositions. To compare CoViD-19 and overall mortality levels, the Crude Death Rate (CDR) and life expectancy at birth for recent calendar years are the most widely available overall mortality indicators. Readily comparable to an annual CDR, a Crude CoViD-19 Death Rate (CCDR) can be calculated for periods of any duration. CoViD-19-induced declines in projected life expectancy at birth for 2020 can also be calculated from existing life tables. We calculate the CCMR and CCDR for the period from their first CoViD-19 death to the present using US age and sex data and current estimates of CoViD-19 deaths in 166 Countries whose population composition is available from the UN, 28 Provinces in China, the 50 United States and DC. Across these 245 populations, 14 States and 11 Countries have CCMR values above 1—the US value by construction. Most affected to date, the period CCDR in New York exceeds its CDR for the most recent year available (7.83 per thousand in 2017). We also calculate CCMR and CCDR values corresponding to projections for the 50 States and DC, and for 49 countries, for which we can additionally calculate reductions in 2020 life expectancy at birth using UN life tables. This suggests life-expectancy reductions between .5 and 1 year for 7 European Countries, 3 South-American Countries and the US. The .55 reduction in the U.S. amounts to nearly twice the largest single-year decline induced by HIV/AIDS (−.3 between 1992 and 1993) or the total decline induced by opioid overdoses (also −.3 between 2014 and 2017), and would bring US life expectancy at birth down to its lowest level since 2008. As current CoViD-19 death counts likely underestimate the total increase in deaths and current projections do not account for possible new infection waves later this year, the impact on 2020 life expectancies at birth should be expected to exceed these figures.

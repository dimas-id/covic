Governments worldwide have responded to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by officially imposing or unofficially encouraging social distancing measures. These measures have had a positive impact on the spread of the virus, however the "stay at home" formula and the lack of specific scientific information about SARS-CoV-2 has understandably resulted in increased anxiety and fear. One unforeseen consequence has been an enhanced risk of underestimating the symptoms and clinical signs of others pathologies even more severe than the viral infection. In the last 35 days, we have observed 8 patients who delayed coming to our hospital emergency room despite unmistakable clinical symptoms and signs of acute haematological disease, putting themselves at risk of compromising their entire therapeutic plan. The similarities between viral symptoms and initial clinical signs of haematological pathologies and the anxiety of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection were the main causes of this delay.

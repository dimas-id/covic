This study aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy with pure intracorporeal modified Ves.Pa neobladder with stentless ureteroileal anastomosis. Pure intracorporeal robotic assisted laparoscopic technique has been recently developed with a select number of high-volume centers utilizing various operative and neobladder techniques. We reviewed the patient characteristics, operative details and perioperative courses in the two patients who have undergone robotic assisted laparoscopic radical cystectomy with pure intracorporeal modified Ves.Pa neobladder and one who has undergone the Hautmann W neobladder. These results were compared to other contemporary robotic neobladder series. We demonstrate technical success with similar operative and perioperative results with the modified Ves.Pa neobladder. The robotic pure intracorporeal modified Ves.Pa neobladder is a technically feasible operation and may be easier to perform compared to other neobladders. Initial experience suggests operative time and perioperative outcomes are similar to other robotic techniques.

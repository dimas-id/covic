Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is noninferior to surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with high operative risk and superior to medical treatment in patients deemed unsuitable for surgical intervention. However, up to 30% to 50% of patients screened for this intervention are not candidates for TAVR via the preferred transfemoral route because of severe peripheral arterial disease. Alternative access routes must be considered and include the transapical, transaortic, transsubclavian, and transcarotid approaches. The use of alternative access is predicated on appropriate patient selection as determined by a dedicated multispecialty heart valve team and can lead to excellent outcomes.

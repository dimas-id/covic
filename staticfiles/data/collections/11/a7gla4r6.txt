The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic has impacted nearly every aspect of otolaryngologic practice. The transition from office-based evaluation to telemedicine and the number of postponed elective surgical cases is unprecedented. There is a significant need to resume elective surgical care for these patients at the appropriate time. As practices begin to move towards resuming elective and same day ambulatory surgery, safety of both the patient and healthcare team is of paramount importance. Usage of total intravenous anesthesia (propofol and remifentanil) over volatile gas anesthesia (e.g., sevoflurane) may increase the number of patients able to safely receive care by reducing potential spread of the virus through reduction in coughing and significantly decreasing the time spent in the recovery room.

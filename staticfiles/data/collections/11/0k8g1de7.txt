Background: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in the post-operative period is challenging. Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications. Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. Patients and Methods: We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. Results: Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. Among them, five (62%) required mechanical ventilation and two (25%) died. All had abnormal chest CT with typical findings of COVID-19 in 87%. Computed tomography provided an alternate diagnosis in 53% of patients who did not have COVID-19. The average time between a COVID-19-positive chest CT and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation was 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days). Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19. In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.

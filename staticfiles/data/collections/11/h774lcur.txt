The area of Computational Creativity has received much attention in recent years. In this paper, within this framework, we propose a model for the generation of literary sentences in Spanish, which is based on statistical algorithms, shallow parsing and the automatic detection of personality features of characters of well known literary texts. We present encouraging results of the analysis of sentences generated by our methods obtained with human inspection.

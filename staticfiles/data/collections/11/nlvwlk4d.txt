Molecular diagnostics for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have become commonplace, and various tests and systems have been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States. We performed a retrospective study to compare the Cepheid Xpress Flu/RSV assay with the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay, using laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) as the reference method. The Xpress assay was 100% accurate compared to LDTs, whereas the Xpert Flu/RSV XC assay was 96.0% accurate. The Xpress test was determined to be faster and more sensitive than the XC assay.

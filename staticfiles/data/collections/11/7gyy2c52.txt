A forgotten and valuable chapter in the history of tobacco concerns its role as a botanical medicine. For three hundred years following its importation into Europe, tobacco came to be considered a universal remedy highly prescribed by physicians. In the early history of tobacco, the literature on its medicinal benefits was voluminous. Nonetheless, bitter opposition to its use for non-medicinal purposes began to arise. There was little doubt of its medicinal efficacy at first, but with time, as the concepts and practice of medicine changed, the tide of medical opinion turned against it. Medical support for the therapeutic use of tobacco reached its nadir during the mid-nineteenth century, when it was dropped from most medical pharmacoepiae. Medical opinion on the health hazards of recreational smoking required another 100 years to arrive at the contemporary opinion that cigarette smoking is the single most important preventable environmental factor contributing to illness, disability and death in the U. S.

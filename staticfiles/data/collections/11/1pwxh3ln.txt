Viral infection is triggered when a surface envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is cleaved by host cell proteins of the transmembrane protease serine (TMPRSS) family. The extracellular region of TMPRSS-2, -3, -4, and MSPL are composed of LDLA, SRCR, and SPD domains. MSPL can cleave the consensus multibasic (R-X-X/R-R) and monobasic (Q(E)-T/X-R) motifs on HA, while TMPRSS2 or -4 only cleaves monobasic motifs. To better understand HA cleavage mediated by MSPL, we solved the crystal structure of the extracellular region of human MSPL in complex with the furin inhibitor. The structure revealed that three domains are gathered around the C-terminal Î±-helix of the SPD domain. The furin inhibitor structure shows that the side chain of P1-Arg inserts into the highly conserved S1 pocket, whereas the side chain of P2-Lys interacts with the Asp/Glu-rich 99 loop that is unique to MSPL. We also constructed a homology model of TMPRSS2, which is identified as an initiator of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model suggests that TMPRSS2 is more suitable for Ala/Val residues at the P2 site than Lys/Arg residues.

This paper considers an explicit numerical scheme for solving the mathematical model of the propagation of Covid-19 epidemic with undetected infectious cases. We analyze the stability and convergence rate of the new approach in $L^{\infty}$-norm. The proposed method is less time consuming. Furthermore, the method is stable, at least second-order convergent and can serve as a robust tool for the integration of general systems of ordinary differential equations. A wide set of numerical evidences which consider the case of Cameroon are presented and discussed.

PURPOSE To investigate the efficacy of Permacolâ„¢, a decellularized porcine dermal-derived membrane, as a spacer in the management of lower eyelid retraction. The efficacy of sizing and insertion was investigated, as well as complications. The literature was also reviewed to compare this material with other porcine-derived grafts in use for the management of lower eyelid retraction. METHODS This was a retrospective case series observing all patients who received lower eyelid Permacol implants by the two senior authors (AAM, TGH) for the management of lower eyelid retraction. Patient demographics, indications for surgery, graft size, degree of postoperative lid advancement, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 12 patients (16 eyelids) received Permacol implants for correction of lower eyelid retraction during the study period of 18 months (January 2015 to July 2017). Ten procedures were related to thyroid eye disease, 3 for reconstruction, 2 postcosmetic lower lid blepharoplasty, and one acquired anophthalmic socket. The average preoperative inferior scleral show (ISS) was 1.74 mm, and the average postoperative ISS was 0.82 mm. There was a mean lower eyelid elevation of 0.91 mm (p < 0.005, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and mean ratio of graft height:preoperative ISS was 3.8:1 over a median of 8 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Permacol is a safe and effective alternative to autologous tissues for use as a spacer in patients with lower eyelid retraction of varying etiologies. It does undergo some resorption with time, however this can be predicted and incorporated into surgical planning; we recommend an implant height:ISS ratio of 4:1.

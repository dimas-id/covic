Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare with an estimated incidence of 0.1% in the general population, and they represent approximately 25% of all visceral aneurysms. The gold standard of treatment is open surgery, but it is associated with a high risk of nephrectomy, mortality, and morbidity. Less invasive endovascular therapies are becoming increasingly common for the treatment of RAAs. Here, we aimed to report three cases of wide-necked complex renal artery aneurysms treated endovascularly using stent-assisted coil embolization with self-expandable stent nitinol Solitaire AB and Concerto Axium coils. In addition, we describe the use of the waffle-cone technique in a case of wide-necked saccular RAA involving the renal artery bifurcation. Technical success was achieved in all three cases with no early or late complications and no recurrences.

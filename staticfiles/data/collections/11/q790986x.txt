Families with children who have developmental disabilities and complex communication needs (CCNs) face challenging demands affecting family adaptation. Many children with CCNs use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices to support communication, yet little is known about family adaptation to such technology. To fill this gap, an integrative review, guided by the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation was conducted to assess conceptual foundations and the state of the science of family adaptation among children utilizing AAC. Web-based searches were conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Thirty-three studies met eligibility. Findings demonstrated that to enhance the science underpinning family adaptation to AAC use, future research should be grounded conceptually and address important components of the Resiliency Model. Work in this emerging area will identify and facilitate nursing efforts to assist families as they adapt to communication technology.

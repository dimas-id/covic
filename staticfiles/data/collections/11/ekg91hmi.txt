The zoonotic transmission of SARS coronavirus from animals to humans revealed the potential impact of coronaviruses on mankind. This incident also triggered several surveillance programs to hunt for novel coronaviruses in human and wildlife populations. Using classical RT-PCR assays that target a highly conserved sequence among coronaviruses, we identified the first coronaviruses in bats. These assays and the cloning and sequencing of the PCR products are described in this chapter. Using the same approach in our subsequent studies, we further detected several novel coronaviruses in bats. These findings highlighted the fact that bats are important reservoirs for coronaviruses.

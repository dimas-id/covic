Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and has spread worldwide. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and employ a complicated pattern of virus genome length RNA replication as well as transcription of genome length and leader containing subgenomic RNAs. Although not fully understood, both replication and transcription are thought to take place in so-called double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. We here describe detection of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples up to 17 days after initial detection of infection, and provide a likely explanation not only for extended PCR positivity of such samples, but also for discrepancies in results of different PCR methods described by others. Overall, we present evidence that subgenomic RNAs may not be an indicator of active coronavirus replication/infection, but that these RNAs, similar to the virus genome RNA, may be rather stable, and thus detectable for an extended period, most likely due to their close association with cellular membranes.

New discoveries in stem cell biology are making the biology of solid tissues increasingly complex. Important seminal studies demonstrating the presence of damage-resistant cell populations together with new isolation and characterization techniques suggest that stem cells exist in the adult lung. More detailed in vivo molecular and cellular characterization of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), other putative lung stem and progenitor cells, and differentiated cells is needed to determine the lineage relationships in adult lung. Lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the most common form of lung cancer in the United States, all involve apparent bronchiolar and alveolar cell defects. It is likely that the delicate balance of stem, progenitor, and differentiated cell functions in the lung is critically affected in patients with these devastating diseases. Thus the discovery of BASCs and other putative lung stem cells will lay the foundation for new inroads to understanding lung biology related to lung disease.

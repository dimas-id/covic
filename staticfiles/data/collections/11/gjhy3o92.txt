The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended the social lives and health of all people globally. The debilitating brunt of the infection and mortality has been huge for older adults with comorbidities. The exponential rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ghana have engendered intense fear and anxiety among the at-risk populations with serious implications for mental health and well-being of older people. In this letter, I call on the government to implement innovative interventions to contain the spread of COVID-19 to older people. The health system should realign to deliver geriatric care and psychological support for older people in these extraordinary times.

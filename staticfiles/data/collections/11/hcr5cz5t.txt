Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is associated with production inefficiencies in domestic fowl, and causes massive economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Progress has been made in designing novel and efficient candidate vaccines to control IBV infection. BacMam virus, a modified baculovirus mediating transgene expression under the control of a mammalian promoter, has emerged as a versatile and safe vector during vaccine development. In previous work, we generated the BacMam virus Ac-CMV-S1, which expressed the S1 glycoprotein of IBV-M41. We showed that Ac-CMV-S1 induced excellent cellular immunity, but did not confer adequate protection in chickens compared with the conventional inactivated vaccine. In the current study, we generated an improved BacMam virus, BV-Dual-S1. This virus displayed the S1 glycoprotein on the baculovirus envelope, and was capable of expressing it in mammalian cells. BV-Dual-S1 elicited stronger humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and showed greater capacity for induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, compared with Ac-CMV-S1 in specific pathogen-free chickens. A significant difference was not observed for protection rates between chickens immunized with BV-Dual-S1 (83%) or inactivated vaccine (89%) following challenge with virulent IBV-M41. Our findings show that the protective efficacy of BV-Dual-S1 could be significantly enhanced by baculovirus display technology. BacMam virus-based surface display strategies could serve as effective tools in designing vaccines against IB and other infectious diseases.

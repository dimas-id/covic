BACKGROUND: Concerns on human and environmental safety and label claims of many microbicides point to the need for safer, faster acting, and broad-spectrum substitutes. ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H(2)O(2) (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. METHODS: ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. RESULTS: At 20Â°C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD(50) (lethal dose 50%) was >5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals. CONCLUSION: The tested formulation showed a high safety and materials compatibility profile in addition to being a fast acting, intermediate-level disinfectant.

Knights Cabin Cancer retreats may represent an ideal opportunity and environment to fill the gap in health education and behavioral change. It is unknown, however, whether the program improves quality of life, physical activity, and psychosocial health. Cancer survivors who enrolled in a retreat completed online questionnaires prior to and 3 months post to assess health-related quality of life, physical activity, and psychosocial variables; perceived stress, depression, and self-esteem. Paired t tests were utilized to compare changes pre and 3 months post the retreat. The majority of the 51 cancer survivors were female with a mean age of 53. The mental component summary of health-related quality of life (p < 0.016) and physical activity score (p = 0.048) was significantly improved at follow-up, while the physical component summary of health-related quality of life was not (p = 0.139). In addition, participants showed an improvement in psychosocial variables of self-esteem (p = 0.016) and depression (p = 0.016) after 3 months but did not show a significant improvement in perceived stress (p = 0.054). Improvements were seen following a Knights Cabin Cancer retreat in mental health-related quality of life and physical activity as well as some psychosocial variables. Further research is needed to evaluate the individual program components and the sustainability of the program in the community.

With accumulated surgical experience, the contraindications to laparoscopic surgery have been decreasing. Reduced port laparoscopic surgery has been widely adopted for a variety of diseases. However, surgery in patients with anatomic deformities are still a challenge for surgeons, specifically abdominal surgery in patients with severe kyphosis. A 71-year-old man with a diagnosis of ascending colon cancer had severe kyphosis with extremely short stature, secondary to tuberculous spondylitis. Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was successfully performed with a single umbilical incision plus one port. This is the first reported case involving laparoscopic surgery in a patient with tuberculous kyphosis. The purpose of this report is to describe the surgical skills of reduced port laparoscopic surgery in a patient with altered habitus. With proper planning and a meticulous operation, minimally invasive surgery could be safely achieved.

Network models of gene interactions, using time course gene transcript abundance data, are computationally created using a genetic algorithm designed to incorporate hierarchical Bayesian methods with time series adjustments. The posterior probabilities of interaction between pairs of genes are based on likelihoods of directed acyclic graphs. This algorithm is applied to transcript abundance data collected from Arabidopsis thaliana genes. This study extends the underlying statistical and mathematical theory of the Norris-Patton likelihood by including time series adjustments.

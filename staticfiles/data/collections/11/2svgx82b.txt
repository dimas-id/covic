Background. The clinical appearance of the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) shows several parallels to the Kawasaki syndrome. The treatment of choice in Kawasaki's disease is high dose application of immunglobulins whereas a standardised treatment of TSS has not yet been defined. Case report. We report of a 14 year old girl with severe TSS which did not occur during menstruation. Treatment with high dose immunglobulins (2 g/kg KG) and antibiotics resulted in prompt recovery.

A 70-year old man was scheduled for the robotic resection of a 21x16x30 mm thymic nodule incidentally detected by a computed tomography scan (CT) for thoracic trauma after a domestic accident. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan confirmed a low [18F]-FDG uptake (SUVmax=1,9). During the surgery the mass showed to be a saccular aneurysm of the left brachiocephalic vein (LBCV). A complete tangential resection of the aneurysm, with the use of EndoGIA stapler (Covidien® Endo GIA™) at its origin was performed. Patient's recovery was uneventful and postoperative CT with contrast administration confirmed the patency of the vein.

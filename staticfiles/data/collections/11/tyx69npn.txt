In this work, we say that a computation is reversible if one can find a procedure to undo the steps of a standard (or forward) computation in a deterministic way. While logic programs are often invertible (e.g., one can use the same predicate for adding and for subtracting natural numbers), computations are not reversible in the above sense. In this paper, we present a so-called Landauer embedding for SLD resolution, the operational principle of logic programs, so that it becomes reversible. A proof-of-concept implementation of a reversible debugger for Prolog that follows the ideas in this paper has been developed and is publicly available.

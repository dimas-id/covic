Ruxolitinib is the first approved JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor. It inhibits the JAK / STAT pathway which is one of the main cellular signaling pathways especially regulates inflammatory response. COVID-19 is an urgent pandemic situation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review firstly presents an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and then it focuses on the potential efficacy of ruxolitinib in this infection. The possible targets of ruxolitinib are determined by using genetic alterations that have been reported in COVID-19 patients. The potential effectiveness of ruxolitinib is suggested by evaluating the interactions of these potential targets which are directly affected by the ruxolitinib or JAK/STAT pathway.

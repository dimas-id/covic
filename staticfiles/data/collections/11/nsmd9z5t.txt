The months from March to June refer as water crisis months in many places of India, because in these months of summer generally, Indian people face shortage of water. In the summer season, groundwater level decreases due to high temperature and increased evaporation of water in most of the places. This present discussion is focused on one positive aspect during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is related to rainfall during this summer in India. It has been observed that the rainfall in India in the months of March to May (as of now, on May 18, 2020) is high as compared to previous years and it might increase the groundwater level and people of India would not face a water crisis during this summer.

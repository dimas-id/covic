As one of the most important mosquito‐borne viral diseases, dengue infection is now becoming a global concern due to its rapid spread and rise in incidence. Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral drug for dengue virus (DENV) infection. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa) and its related derivatives have been reported to inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses. However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV‐permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time‐of‐addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells. Directly incubating DENV with CBX resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity. Furthermore, DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose‐dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself. Our work, for the first time, demonstrates that CBX has antiviral activity against DENV infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue.

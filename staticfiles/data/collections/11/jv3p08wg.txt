Background Transbronchial lung biopsy is an important approach to diagnose peripheral lung cancer, but bronchoscopy based treatment options are limited and poorly studied. A flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation (MWA) catheter was developed to evaluate the feasibility and safety both in ex vivo and in vivo porcine models. Methods Using direct penetration of the catheter through the surface of ex vivo porcine lung, ablations (n=9) were performed at 70, 80, 90 W for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the catheter and 10, 15, 20 mm away from the tip were measured. Under bronchoscopy conditions in porcine lung, ablations (n=18, 6 in ex vivo and 12 in vivo) were performed at 80 W for 5 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) was acquired perioperative, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post ablation. Ablation zones were excised at 24 hours and 4 weeks respectively. Long-axis diameter (Dl) and short-axis diameter (Ds) were measured and tissues were sectioned for pathological examination. Results In-ex vivo lung, the temperature at 20 mm removed was over 60 °C at 80 W for 288±26 seconds. The ablations under bronchoscopic conditions were successful in-ex vivo and in vivo lung. No complications occurred during the procedures. Coagulation necrosis was visible at 24 hours, and repaired fibrous tissue was seen at 4 weeks. Conclusions The flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled MWA is feasible and safe. This early animal data holds promise of MWA becoming a potential therapeutic tool for Peripheral Lung Cancers.

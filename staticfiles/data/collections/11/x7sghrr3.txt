Rodent pinworm infestations are common in modern animal facilities, and treatments to eradicate these nematodes are often costly and labor-intensive. The authors describe a method they developed to treat rodents with ivermectin using the automatic watering system available at their facility. This delivery method proved an efficacious and cost-effective means of eradicating Aspiculuris tetraptera from a large colony of mice. The system might also be used to provide other orally administered agents to mice and other species.

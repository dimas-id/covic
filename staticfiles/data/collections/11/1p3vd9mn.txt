SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19, coronavirus, has created unique challenges for the medical community after national guidelines called for the cancellation of all elective surgery. While there are clear cases of elective surgery (benign cranial cosmetic defect) and emergency surgery (hemorrhage, fracture, trauma, etc.), there is an unchartered middle ground in pediatric neurosurgery. Children, unlike adults, have dynamic anatomy and are still developing neural networks. Delaying seemingly elective surgery can affect a child's already vulnerable health state by further impacting their neurocognitive development, neurologic functioning, and potential long-term health states. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that "elective" pediatric neurosurgery should be risk-stratified, and multi-institutional informed guidelines established.

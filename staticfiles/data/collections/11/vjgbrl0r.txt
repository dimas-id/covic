The Chair of The National Hearing Voices Network (http://www.hearing-voices.org/HVN) prepared this document, on behalf of the HVN Board, to provide some sources of information and support for its members, and others, during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the request of the journal Editor (also a member of the HVN Board), the document is published here, verbatim, for Psychosis readers around the world. Although targeted at people in the UK who hear voices or see visions, much of the information is potentially also relevant for other people, including mental health professionals. Like HVN, neither the journal nor ISPS endorse or recommend specific mental health services or practitioners. We recognise that different things are helpful for different people. The document is published merely to increase the range of options for people to choose from if they feel the need for additional support or information. All at HVN, Psychosis and ISPS wish readers a safe passage though the current stormy waters, which, despite all the fears and losses, are providing us all with opportunities to take care of one another like many of us have never experienced before.

A recombinant DNA probe with specificity for the 3â€² end of genomic RNA from the Ark 99 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was found to hybridize with extracted RNA of three strains with the Ark serotype, as well as the Mass41, Holl52, Gray, JMK, Conn, Fla and SE17 strains of IBV. Viral infection was detected in the cytoplasm of chicken embryo kidney cells inoculated with Mass41, Ark99, SE17 or two recent field isolates of IBV using in situ cytohybridization and a biotinylated probe. In vivo infections were detected in individual cells of tracheas and lungs 2, 4, and 6 days after inoculation of chicks with Mass41 and Ark99. In situ hybridization of Ark99 infected tissue sections using (32)P-dATP labelled probe indicated that more viral replication was present in the trachea on day 4 than either days 2 or 6; whereas more viral RNA was found in the lungs on day 6 than days 2 or 4 after inoculation.

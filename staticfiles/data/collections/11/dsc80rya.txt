In a short review the national and international reception of the German guidelines for reprocessing flexible endoscopes is presented. The recommendations of the guidelines are discussed in view of recent knowledge on old problems such as prion inactivation and new infectious diseases and new microorganisms such as SARS, avian influenza and C. difficile. New disinfectants and new methods for endoscope disinfection are mentioned, the importance of careful cleaning is underlined. The German guidelines of the Robert Koch Institute and the US Multi-Society guidelines, published in 2003, are compared. The discrepancies concerning recommendations for water quality for final rinsing and need of microbiological controls of endoscope reprocessing are stressed. Aspects not mentioned in the German guidelines, e.g. duration of storage after reprocessing and risk of infection transmission by the endo-washer, are discussed.

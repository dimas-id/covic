Aims: Ideal glycemic control is of great importance for diabetic patients during public health emergencies of infectious diseases as long-term hyperglycemic are not only associated with chronic complications but also vital drivers of common and life-threatening infections. The present study was designed to investigate the changes of blood glucose levels in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes(T2D) during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This retrospective study focused on the T2D outpatients at Fujian Provincial Hospital aged 65 years old and above who received baseline test for fasting plasma glucose and/or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between January 1, 2019 and March 8, 2019 and were followed up on fasting plasma glucose and/or HbA1c in the same period in 2020. The baseline and follow-up data were analyzed with the paired-samples T-test. Results: A total of 135 elderly subjects with T2D with baseline and follow-up fasting plasma glucose and 50 elderly subjects with T2D with baseline and follow-up HbA1c were analyzed, respectively. The baseline and follow-up mean fasting plasma glucose were 7.08 and 7.48 mmol/L, respectively (P=0.008). The mean baseline and follow-up HbA1c were 7.2 and 7.4, respectively (P=0.158). Conclusions: Elderly subjects with T2D had higher fasting plasma glucose levels during COVID-19 outbreak. We should pay more attension to the management of diabetics during public health emergencies.

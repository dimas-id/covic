Background With the gradual reopening of economies and resumption of social life, robust surveillance mechanisms should be implemented to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented. Methods We performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available sequences. Results We show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is a practical, cost-effective, and powerful approach for population-based surveillance and control of viral transmission in the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

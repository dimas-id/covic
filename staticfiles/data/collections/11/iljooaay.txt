The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still progressing and has been recorded in more than 210 countries and territories worldwide. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first cases of COVID- 19 were detected on March 5, 2020 in the entity of the Republic of Srpska and on March 9, 2020 in the entity of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By May 16, 2020, more than 2,200 COVID-19 cases had been recorded in both entities, with a mortality rate of 5.8% (131 of 2,231 cases). The aim of this ongoing study is to present the current epidemiological and sociodemographic parameters of 380 COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (UCH Mostar) during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those 380 patients, 60 (15.8%) required hospitalization. The mortality rate was 5% (19/380). The highest mortality rate (15.2%, 12/79) was recorded in the patients aged &#8805;65 years. In addition to this single-center experience of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the epidemiological mea-sures imposed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an emphasis on the restrictive measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

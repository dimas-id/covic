Background Since December 2019, we have been facing one of the worst pandemics of human history. It originated from the Hubei province in China as a case of pneumonia, later named COVID-19.1 The causative pathogen, a new enveloped betacoronavirus2 is now known as Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV 2). India reported its first case of COVID19, on 30th January 2020. We aim to identify the defining clinical and radiological characteristics, severity and prognosis, along with impact of age on outcome. Methods Cross sectional, observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID -19 [RT-PCR]. Results We observed male predominance, mean age of 36 years, with less or no symptoms, majority brought in after screening and contact tracing by the screening teams. Thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, raised LDH was common (>35%, p<0.05). Patients over the age of 60 were the ones having severe illness and more complications (p<0.05). Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities. Discussion Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged â‰¥60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into. Chest X-ray proves sufficient for imaging, reducing the requirement of CT scans. Studies involving larger sample size and interventional trials are need of the hour.

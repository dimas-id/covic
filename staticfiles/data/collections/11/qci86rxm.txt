Fluid therapy is generally the most life saving and important therapeutic measure in a critical pet suffering from dehydration due to gastrointestinal losses (vomiting and/or diarrhea). Fluid therapy should be personalized to the patientâ€™s history, complaint, physical examination and laboratory findings. It is directed to the patients needs and modified based of the physical and laboratory findings until fluid therapy resuscitation end points are achieved.

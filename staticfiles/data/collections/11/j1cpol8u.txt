To gain knowledge about the role of young children attending daycare in transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2, a random sample of children (n=84) aged between 6 and 30 months attending daycare in Belgium was studied shortly after the start of the epidemic (February 29th) and before the lockdown (March 18th). No asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas common cold symptoms were common (51.2%).

A 58-year-old man had an intrathecal baclofen pump implanted. A guidewire used during removal of a previously placed lumbar drain catheter fractured, and a fragment was left within the thecal sac. Using fluoroscopic guidance, a loop snare device was used to retrieve the intrathecal foreign body successfully and without complication. The pump was placed without any difficulty, and the patient's hospital course was uneventful.

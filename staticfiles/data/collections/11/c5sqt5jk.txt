Objective To investigate the application of pulmonary ultrasound in the diagnosis of neonatal novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods In this retrospective study, the clinical data of 5 infants, who were admitted to the Department of Neonatology in Wuhan Children's hospital from 31 th January to 25 th February 2020, were collected. Bedside pulmondary ultrasound was conducted on admission, during the hospitalization, and before discharge, and the result were compared with the chest X-ray or CT done at the same time. Results Among the 5 cases who aged 1-18 days, 3 were male. The main clinical manifestations were respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. The pulmonary ultrasonography on admission showed abnormal pleural line and pulmonary edema of different severity in all 5 cases, presented as increase and fusion of B-line, and pulmonary interstitial syndrome; among them, one case also had a small-range consolidation. The chest CT on admission showed no obvious parenchymal infiltration in 2 cases, small strip or patchy high-density shadow in 2 cases, and ground glass change in one case. The re-examination of ultrosound during the hospitalization and at discharge showed improvement in all cases and were consistent with the chest X-ray taken at the sametime. Conclusions The main changes on the pulmonary ultrasonography in neonates with COVID-19 pneumonia are increase and fusion of B-line, abnormal pleural line, and nalveolar interstitial syndrome, and may combined with small range of pulmonary consolidation. The sensitivity of pulmonary ultrasound is higher than chest X-ray and CT in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, and could be used in monitoring and evaluation of the disease.

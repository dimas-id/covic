Abstract As the nanotechnological applications have taken over in different fields, their applications for water and wastewater treatment is also surfacing as a fast-developing and very promising area. Recent advancements in nanotechnological science and engineering advise that many of the waterborne pathogens could be culminated or debilitated using nanobiosorbents, nanocatalysts, bioactive nanoparticles, nanostructured catalytic membranes, nanobioreactors, nanoparticle-enhanced filtration among other products, and processes resulting from the development of nanotechnology. A detailed insight has been provided for advanced techniques such as photochemical (photocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes) applications of metal oxide nanoparticles, nanomembrane technology, bioinspired nanomaterials, and nanotechnological innovations (nano-Ag, fullerenes, nanotubes, and molecularly imprinted polymers, etc.), which prove to be highly potential as well as promising and cost-effective. However, there are still some shortcomings and challenges that must be overcome which will be looked upon in this chapter.

The 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak (now recognized as SARS-CoV-2, triggering the COVID-19 disease) has spread from Wuhan throughout China and has been distributed to an increasing range of countries. Early activity has concentrated on explaining the course of the disease, reporting critical incidents, and handling the ill. Currently, Vietnam, an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country that shares a long border with China, has successfully controlled COVID-19. In this article, we aimed to provide updated information regarding COVID-19 in Vietnam, from the first case to the current outbreak. We hope the information in this article will help the world understand more about the surveillance and prevention policies of Vietnamâ€™s COVID-19. The numerous lessons learned will serve as a guide for handling possible pandemics, but a permanently new global framework is expected in the immediate future.

This article provides a framework for pediatric intensivists to guide the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected encephalitis. It provides an in-depth review of the most common causes of encephalitis in children. The article promotes early recognition, appropriate testing and empiric treatment, and management of the expected complications of acute encephalitis.

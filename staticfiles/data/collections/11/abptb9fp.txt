In the management of lung metastases originating from colorectal cancer, RFA is particularly indicated in case of major comorbidities contraindicating thoracic surgery or recurrent disease after previous ipsilateral resection. The most frequent complication of RFA is pneumothorax, requiring chest tube insertion in 5% of cases. Interestingly, this proportion is very close to the rate of local recurrence, suggesting a possible association. We report a case of RFA followed by intractable pneumothorax requiring surgical management, and leading to the diagnosis of residual tumour. This case report illustrates this association and questions its relevance.

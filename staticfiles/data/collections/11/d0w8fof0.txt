BACKGROUND: Mothers of moderately to severely affected children with cerebral palsy (CP) have to spend a long time to take care of their children. This time-consuming responsibility affects their physical and psychosocial health. Therefore, mothers as caregivers are required to receive special training to take care of their children. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a developed web-based intervention for daily care training of children with CP on their mothers’ quality of life (QOL), anxiety, depression, stress, and their musculoskeletal pain. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This study was a single blind randomized controlled trial. 91 mothers of children with CP with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III, IѴ, and Ѵ, who aged from 4 to 12 years were assigned to the intervention and control groups using block randomization. Mothers in the control group received their routine face to face occupational therapy intervention and mothers in the intervention group received 12 weeks web-based intervention. QOL, depression, anxiety, stress, and pain were measured before and after the intervention in both groups. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The results of analysis of covariance showed that after controlling the mean score of pretest of pain, the mean score of post-tests in the intervention and control groups was significantly different (P < 0.05). The mean scores of physical health and total QOL scores of post-tests in the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group with controlling pretest scores. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Designed web-based intervention affects the caregivers’ QOL and pain significantly. This intervention can be used to provide daily care training for mothers of children with CP.

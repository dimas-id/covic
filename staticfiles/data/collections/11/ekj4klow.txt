In this paper, we present a new closure operator defined on the set of attributes of an information system that satisfies the conditions for defining a matroid. We establish some basic relationships between equivalence classes and approximation operators where different sets of attributes are used. It is shown that the reducts of an information system can be obtained from dependent sets of a matroid. Finally, we show that the closure operator can be defined at least in three different ways.

BACKGROUND Percutaneous renal denervation (RDN) has recently been introduced as a treatment for therapy-resistant hypertension. Also, it has been suggested that RDN may be beneficial for other conditions characterised by increased sympathetic nerve activity. There are still many uncertainties with regard to efficacy, safety, predictors for success and long-term effects. To answer these important questions, we initiated a Dutch RDN registry aiming to collect data from all RDN procedures performed in the Netherlands. METHODS The Dutch RDN registry is an ongoing investigator-initiated, prospective, multicentre cohort study. Twenty-six Dutch hospitals agreed to participate in this registry. All patients who undergo RDN, regardless of the clinical indication or device that is used, will be included. Data are currently being collected on eligibility and screening, treatment and follow-up. RESULTS Procedures have been performed since August 2010. At present, data from 306 patients have been entered into the database. The main indication for RDN was hypertension (n = 302, 99%). Patients had a mean office blood pressure of 177/100 (±29/16) mmHg with a median use of three (range 0-8) blood pressure lowering drugs. Mean 24-hour blood pressure before RDN was 157/93 (±18/13) mmHg. RDN was performed with different devices, with the Simplicity™ catheter currently used most frequently. CONCLUSION Here we report on the rationale and design of the Dutch RDN registry. Enrolment in this investigator-initiated study is ongoing. We present baseline characteristics of the first 306 participants.

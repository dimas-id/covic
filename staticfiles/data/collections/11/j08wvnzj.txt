Pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer is an important tool in the prognostication of the disease in selected patients who are at risk of occult lymph node metastases. This procedure, usually performed in conjunction with radical prostatectomy, had progressed successfully from an open approach to the current robot-assisted approach. The following article and accompanying video describe the surgical technique of robot-assisted pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer. We also discuss the indications, patient selection, preparation, complications, and tips to avoid the major pitfalls in the procedure.

Ambient systems owns some particular characteristics that makes their context awareness a sincere problem; they are composed of heterogeneous distributed devices, some of these devices may appear and disappear during operations. In addition, users interacting in these systems are themselves dynamic. Therefore, context-aware workflow management allows workflows to adapt dynamically according to the environment changes. Context information are complex and diverse which makes the modeling the key issue. This paper presents an approach to model context-aware workflows. First, we describe the workflow using Ag-LOTOS. Then, based on this description, we build the contextual planning system CPSw that allows the presentation of the context at each activity state.

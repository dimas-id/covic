The seasonal succession of members of the invertebrate community of a temporary vernal pond in southern Ontario is described. Although succession was essentially continuous, 5 faunal groups are suggested, based on time of appearance and duration of active forms in the pond. Some species were found during virtually the entire aquatic phase, while others completed their life cycles in only 2‚Äê3 weeks. Analysis of growth rates revealed many different patterns between species and groups. Analysis of community structure in terms of trophic status indicated shifts which coincided with the seasonal occurrence of the pond's potential food resources. Comparison of this fauna with that of a similar pond on Vancouver Island, British Columbia (some 2,400 km to the west) showed many similarities in niche occupancy, including 6 species in common. The biological characteristics leading to the success of these cosmopolitan species in temporary aquatic habitats is discussed.

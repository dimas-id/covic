A number of nonequivalent perspectives on granular computing are known in the literature, and many are in states of continuous development. Further related concepts of granules and granulations may be incompatible in many senses. This expository paper is intended to explain basic aspects of these from a critical perspective, their range of applications and provide directions relative to general rough sets and related formal approaches to vagueness. General granular principles related to knowledge are also mentioned.

Theranostic nanoparticles based on biocompatible mineral compositions can significantly improve the translational potential of image guided cancer nano-therapy. Here, we report development of a single-phase calcium phosphate biomineral nanoparticle (nCP) with dual-mode magnetic resonance contrast (T1-T2) together with radiofrequency (RF) mediated thermal response suitable for image-guided RF ablation of cancer. The nanoparticles (NP) are engineered to provide dual MR contrast by an optimized doping concentration (4.1 at%) of paramagnetic ion, Fe3+, which also renders lossy dielectric character for nCP leading to thermal response under RF exposure. In vivo compatibility and dual-mode MR contrast are demonstrated in healthy rat models. MRI and T2 mapping suggest hepatobiliary clearance by ~96 hours. MRI guided intratumoral injection in subcutaneous rat glioma and orthotopic liver tumor models provide clear visualization of NP in MRI which also helps in quantifying NP distribution within tumor. Furthermore, by utilising RF mediated thermal response, NP treated tumor could be ablated using clinically approved RF ablation system (10 W,13.3 GHz). Real-time in vivo thermal imaging exhibits 119 ± 10% increase in temperature change (ΔT) for NP treated orthotopic liver tumor (ΔT = 51.5 ± 2 °C), compared to untreated healthy liver control (ΔT = 21.5 ± 2 °C). In effect, we demonstrate a promising nano-biomineral theranostic agent for dual-mode MRI combined with radiofrequency ablation of solid tumors.

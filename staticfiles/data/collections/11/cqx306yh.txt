Abstract The recent release of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein allows detailed analysis of the structural features that are required for stabilizing the infective form of its quaternary assembly. Trying to disassemble the trimeric structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein, we analyzed single protomer surfaces searching for concave moieties that are located at the three protomer-protomer interfaces. The presence of some druggable pockets at these interfaces suggested that some of the available drugs in Drug Bank could destabilize the quaternary spike glycoprotein formation by binding to these pockets, therefore interfering with COVID-19 life cycle. The approach we propose here can be an additional strategy to fight against the deadly virus. Ligands of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein that we have predicted in the present computational investigation, might be the basis for new experimental studies in vitro and in vivo.

Four strains of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus were examined for the presence of phosphorylated proteins. The nucleocapsid protein was determined to contain phosphate covalently linked to serine but not to threonine residues. The nucleocapsid protein was the only phosphorylated protein detected in these strains of murine hepatitis virus.

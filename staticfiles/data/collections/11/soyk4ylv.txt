Mouse hepatitis virus receptor (MHVR) is a murine biliary glycoprotein (Bgp1(a)). Purified, soluble MHVR expressed from a recombinant vaccinia virus neutralized the infectivity of the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) in a concentration-dependent manner. Several anchored murine Bgps in addition to MHVR can also function as MHV-A59 receptors when expressed at high levels in nonmurine cells. To investigate the interactions of these alternative MHVR glycoproteins with MHV, we expressed and purified to apparent homogeneity the extracellular domains of several murine Bgps as soluble, six-histidine-tagged glycoproteins, using a baculovirus expression system. These include MHVR isoforms containing four or two extracellular domains and the corresponding Bgp1(b) glycoproteins from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice, as well as Bgp2 and truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1(b) comprised of the first two immunoglobulin-like domains. The soluble four-domain MHVR glycoprotein (sMHVR[1-4]) had fourfold more MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding soluble Bgp1(b) (sBgp1(b)) glycoprotein and at least 1,000-fold more neutralizing activity than sBgp2. Although virus binds to the N-terminal domain (domain 1), soluble truncation mutants of MHVR and Bgp1(b) containing only domains 1 and 2 bound virus poorly and had 10- and 300-fold less MHV-A59 neutralizing activity than the corresponding four-domain glycoproteins. In contrast, the soluble MHVR glycoprotein containing domains 1 and 4 (sMHVR[1,4]) had as much neutralizing activity as the four-domain glycoprotein, sMHVR[1-4]. Thus, the virus neutralizing activity of MHVR domain 1 appears to be enhanced by domain 4. The sBgp1(b)[1-4] glycoprotein had 500-fold less neutralizing activity for MHV-JHM than for MHV-A59. Thus, MHV strains with differences in S-glycoprotein sequence, tissue tropism, and virulence can differ in the ability to utilize the various murine Bgps as receptors.

Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was of clustering onset in China and challenging to the Chinese healthcare system. Epidemiological data showed that the older patients with chronic commodities were at high risk of the involvement of the severe and critical type of COVID-19, especially patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) resulting in high mortalities. There were nearly 100 million COPD patients in China, and most of them were the elderly. Once infected with COVID-19, it would be life-threatening for the COPD patients.

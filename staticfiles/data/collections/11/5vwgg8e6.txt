The construction industry is a particularly attractive industry for nanotechnology applications. Since it employs a diversity of building materials, nanomaterials can be employed to enhance the materialsâ€™ performances, durability, longevity and sustainability. The construction and building practice is detrimental to the environment in various aspects such as electricity consumption, landfill accumulation, unhealthy aesthetics and neighborhoods. This chapter shows how nanotechnology-based building materials are playing an important role in green architectural design and construction, which has become a growing trend in many countries. Nanomaterials could be integrated with cement, concrete, or windows to conserve energy, minimize electricity bills and sanitize the surrounding atmosphere. Nevertheless, the industry is still facing many hurdles towards the wide application of nanomaterials in a cost effective manner.

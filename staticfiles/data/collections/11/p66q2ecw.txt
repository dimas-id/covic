PURPOSE OF REVIEW To evaluate recent developments in the response of the healthcare system to the threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the context of the Toronto experience. RECENT FINDINGS The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak affected over 8000 people killing 774 by July 2003. It particularly affected those providing health care. The initial response of the healthcare system was to use infection control techniques to prevent transmission to staff and patients. This had a dramatic impact on healthcare provision for non-severe acute respiratory syndrome patients during this period. SUMMARY The ongoing response to severe acute respiratory syndrome is continued effective infection control education, development of local and global policies for reacting to a severe acute respiratory syndrome-like outbreak in the future, and continued work on a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome.

A 120 kDa glycoprotein in the larval midgut membrane of the Iepidopteran Manduca sexta, previously identified as a putative receptor for Bacillus thuringiensis CrylA(c) δ‐endotoxin, has been purified by a combination of protoxin affinity Chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. In immunoblotting experiments, the purified glycoprotein has the characteristics predicted of the receptor: it binds CrylA(c) toxin In the presence of GlcNAc but not GalNAc; it binds the lectin SBA; but it does not bind CrylB toxin. N‐terminal and internal amino acid sequences obtained from the protein show a high degree of similarity with the enzyme aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2). When assayed for aminopeptidase activity, purified receptor preparations were enriched 5.3‐fold compared to M. sexta brush border membrane vesicles. We propose that the receptor for CrylA(c) toxin in the brush border membrane of the lepidopteran M. sexta is the metalloprotease aminopeptidase N.

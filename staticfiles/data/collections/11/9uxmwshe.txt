Background The aim of the study is to compare the current two endovenous thermal ablation methods by examining the effects on the visual analog scale (VAS) and the short form-36® quality of life index. Methods Ninety-six patients who underwent unilateral endovenous thermal ablation of great saphenous vein were included. ClosureFast™ catheters were used in the RFA group and 1470 nm radial fiber laser catheters were used in the EVLA group. Results The RFA group consisted of 41 patients and the EVLA group consisted of 55 patients. The preoperative baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. On the day of operation, VAS values were 2.8 ± 1.1 in the RFA group and 3.6 ± 1.8 in the EVLA group (p = 0.02). Comparisons of short form-36 parameters in both groups showed them to be similar except the pain detected at postoperative 1st week (48.1 ± 5.4 for RFA, 44.9 ± 7.6 for EVLA, p = 0.04). Conclusion Results in postprocedural quality of life were found to be similar in both of the techniques. However, in terms of postoperative pain, radiofrequency ablation is still superior to the 1470 nm radial fiber laser catheters.

BACKGROUND The minimally invasive approach in spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy has currently been emphasized in benign and pre-malignant pancreatic diseases. The study aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of our technique of robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP) by a stepwise approach. METHODS The data of consecutive patients presented for RSPDP from 2014 to 2019 at Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedure performed, such as Kimura's (KG) or Warshaw's (WG) technique, and then compared. RESULTS In the study period, 32 patients underwent RSPDP. Twenty-three patients presented for the Kimura procedure (72%), while nine patients underwent the Warshaw procedure (28%). A higher body mass index was found in the KG (26 ± 4 vs. 22 ± 3, p = 0.037). Regarding the pathological data, the WG group differed in the tumor dimension, and the lymph nodes harvested (30 ± 2 vs. 17 ± 10, 9 ± 5 vs. 3 ± 4, p = 0.0028, and p = 0.005, respectively). Notably, no conversions and mortality were recorded. The overall morbidity was 25% ( eight patients) with no difference between the groups (p = 0.820). The mean length of stay was 8 days, and was similar between the groups (p = 0.350). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that RSPDP is a valid option for the treatment of benign or pre-malignant pancreatic diseases of the distal pancreas, with comparable morbidity with the standard treatment and no mortality. Further research is needed to standardize the technique and to assess the immunological, surgical, and financial benefits of the procedure.

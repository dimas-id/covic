The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with microvessel density (MVD) in necrotic, partial necrotic, and viable tumors using a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model. Nine rabbits were used for this study. The complete necrotic area (CNA), partial necrotic area (PNA), and viable tumor area (VTA) of liver tumors were experimentally induced by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). DCE-MRI data were processed based on the extended Kety model to estimate Ktrans, ve and vp parameters. The boundaries among CNA, PNA, and VTA were delineated based on H&E stain images, and MVD was assessed for each subregion of each VX2 tumor based. There were no correlations between ph-parameters (Ktrans, ve, and vp) and MVD for CNA. For PNA, the Ktrans values were positively correlated with the MVD (r = 0.8124, p < 0.001). For VTA, we found a positive correlation between Ktrans values and the MVD (r = 0.5743, p < 0.05). Measuring from both the PNA and the VTA, mean Ktrans values were positively correlated with mean MVD (r = 0.8470, p < 0.0001). In a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model, Ktrans values correlated well with MVD counts of PNA and VTA in liver tumors.

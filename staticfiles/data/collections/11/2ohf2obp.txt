Infectious diseases of the upper airway can lead to emergency situations with partial up to complete obstruction and respiratory insufficiency, especially in infants and toddlers. This necessitates a cool-headed and calm approach; however, at times a prompt intervention is required by the primary care physician. Important questions concerning patient history include the onset of symptoms, severity and duration of fever and for orientation possible previously known respiratory problems since birth or in the first weeks afterwards (e.g. congenital malformations of the larynx or trachea). The examination should begin by careful observation of the childâ€™s position of comfort and by noting all vital signs. A child with inspiratory or biphasic stridor at rest already has some degree of airway obstruction that can progress to complete obstruction over time. Systemic steroids and inhalation of nebulized epinephrine (adrenaline) are the best therapeutic options for viral laryngotracheobronchitis, which is the most common cause of acute stridor in childhood. Rare differential diagnoses, such as bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis (supraglottitis), retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal infections necessitate disease-specific management.

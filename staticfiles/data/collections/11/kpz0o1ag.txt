Background: To slow the increasing global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, appropriate disinfection techniques are required. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) has a well-known antiviral effect, but measurements on the radiation dose necessary to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 have not been published so far. Methods: Coronavirus inactivation experiments with ultraviolet light performed in the past were evaluated to determine the UV radiation dose required for a 90% virus reduction. This analysis is based on the fact that all coronaviruses have a similar structure and similar RNA strand length. Results: The available data reveals large variations, which are apparently not caused by the coronaviruses but by the experimental conditions selected. If these are excluded as far as possible, it appears that coronaviruses are very UV sensitive. The upper limit determined for the log-reduction dose (90% reduction) is approximately 10.6 mJ/cm(2) (median), while the true value is probably only 3.7 mJ/cm(2) (median). Conclusion: Since coronaviruses do not differ structurally to any great exent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus – as well as possible future mutations – will very likely be highly UV sensitive, so that common UV disinfection procedures will inactivate the new SARS-CoV-2 virus without any further modification.

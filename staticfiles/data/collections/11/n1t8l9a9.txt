Since the outbreak of the ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, from December 2019, we have learned that multiple organs can be affected with the potential for various complications. Although myalgia is a frequent symptom in COVID- 19 patients, no imaging findings of rhabdomyolysis have been featured in the literature. We report a case of presumed rhabdomyolysis in a 38-year-old male with COVID-19 based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results and radiological findings. By discussing the diagnostic rationale and reviewing the relevant literature we hope to advance the existing understanding of this disease and its effects on the musculoskeletal system.

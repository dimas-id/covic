Background The potential benefit of a combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on COVID-19 has been speculated. We explored the effect of the timing of LPV/r + HCQ initiation on the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 who started treatment with LPV/r plus HCQ between February 21 and March 20, 2020, at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy. Over time cumulative incidence of clinical improvement was compared between patients who started treatment less than 5 days from the onset of symptoms [early treatment group (ET)] and those who initiated it later [delayed treatment group (DT)]. The association of LPV/r plus HCQ initiation timing on 30-day mortality was also assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic models. Results The study included 172 patients, prevalently males (72%) in their sixties, with a moderate (53.4%) or severe (34.9%) disease. Fourty-three (25%) patients were included in the ET group and and 129 (75%) in the DT group. Severity of disease did not significantly differ between the two groups. Conclusion Timing of LPV/r + HCQ initiation seems to have no impact on COVID-19 clinical course in terms of improvement and 30-day mortality. These findings rise doubts on the clincial efficacy of this regimen.

OBJECTIVES To review the current best surgical practice and detail a multi-disciplinary approach that could further reduce joint replacement infection. METHODS Review of relevant literature indexed in PubMed. RESULTS Surgical site infection is a major complication following arthroplasty. Despite its rarity in contemporary orthopaedic practice, it remains difficult to treat and is costly in terms of both patient morbidity and long-term health care resources. CONCLUSIONS Emphasis on education of patients and all members of the health-care team and raising awareness in how to participate in preventative efforts is imperative.

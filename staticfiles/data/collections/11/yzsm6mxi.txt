In infected BHK21 cells, the glycoproteins G1 and G2 of a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts12) of Uukuniemi virus (UUK) accumulate at 39 degrees C in the Golgi complex (GC) causing an expansion and vacuolization of this organelle. We have studied whether such an altered Golgi complex can carry out the glycosylation and transport to the plasma membrane (PM) of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) glycoproteins in double-infected cells. Double-immunofluorescence staining showed that approximately 90% of the cells became infected with both viruses. Almost the same final yield of infectious SFV was obtained from double-infected cells as from cells infected with SFV alone. The rate of transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the GC to the plasma membrane of the SFV glycoproteins was analysed by immunofluorescence, surface radioimmunoassay and pulse-chase labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, endoglycosidase H digestion and SDS-PAGE. The results showed that: the SFV glycoproteins were readily transported to the cell surface in double-infected cells, whereas the UUK glycoproteins were retained in the GC; the transport to the PM was retarded by approximately 20 min, due to a delay between the ER and the central Golgi; E1 of SFV appeared at the PM in a sialylated form. These results indicate that the morphologically altered GC had retained its functional integrity to glycosylate and transport plasma membrane glycoproteins.

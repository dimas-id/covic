Two self-adhering hemostatic patches, based on either PEG-coated collagen (PCC) or PEG-coated oxidized cellulose (PCOC), are compared regarding to maximum burst pressure, mechanical stability, and swelling. In addition, the induction of tissue adhesions by the materials was assessed in a rabbit liver abrasion model. Both materials showed comparable sealing efficacy in a burst pressure test (37 ± 16 vs. 35 ± 8 mmHg, P = 0.730). After incubation in human plasma, PCC retained its mechanical properties over the test period of 8 h, while PCOC showed faster degradation after the 2 h time-point. The degradation led to a significantly decreased force at break (minimum force at break 0.55 N during 8 h for PCC, 0.27 N for PCOC; p < 0.001). Further, PCC allowed significantly higher deformation before break (52% after 4 h and 50% after 8 h for PCC, 18% after 4 h and 23% after 8 h for PCOC; p = 0.003 and p < 0.001 for 4 h and 8 h, respectively) and showed less swelling in human plasma (maximum increase in thickness: ~20% PCC, ~100% PCOC). Faster degradation of PCOC was visible macroscopically and histologically in vivo after 14 days. PCC showed visible structural residues with little cellular infiltration while strong infiltration with no remaining structural material was seen with PCOC. In vivo, a higher incidence of adhesion formation after PCOC application was detected. In conclusion, PCC has more reliable mechanical properties, reduced swelling, and less adhesion formation than PCOC. PCC may offer greater clinical benefit for surgeons in procedures that have potential risk for body fluid leakage or that require prolonged mechanical stability.

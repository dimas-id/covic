BACKGROUND The long term physiological and radiological outcomes of SARS survivors and their possible determinants are uncertain. METHODS SARS survivors in a follow up clinic in a regional hospital underwent high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax and lung function tests 6 months after admission to hospital. The associations between the clinical and demographic data of the patients and the physiological and radiological outcomes were examined. RESULTS Fifty seven patients took part in the study. Lung function abnormalities were detected in 43 patients (75.4%), with restrictive defects (n = 16) being most common (28.1%). Radiological abnormalities of any degree were detected in 43 patients (75.4%). Only the use of pulse corticosteroids was associated with the presence of CT abnormalities (p = 0.043, OR 6.65, 95% CI 1.06 to 41.73). CONCLUSIONS Physiological and radiological abnormalities are still present in a considerable proportion of SARS survivors at 6 months.

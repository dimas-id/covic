A total of 804 goat sera were collected from 144 goat farms in five regions of South Korea during a period between 2005 and 2006 and screened for the antibodies of viral pathogens in ruminants. The individual seropositive rates for each virus were 13.7% (110/804) for bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), 9.5% (76/804) for bovine parainfluenza type-3 virus (PI-3V), 5.5% (44/804) for Akabane virus (AKAV), 13.3% (107/804) for Aino virus (AINV), 2.0% (16/804) for Chuzan virus (CHUV) and 1.0% (8/804) for bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Compared with other areas, Chungcheong Province showed higher seropositive rates of 13.6% for PI-3V, 22.3% for AKAV and 28.2% for AINV. The results indicate that among the six viral diseases, BHV-1 infection is quite prevalent, while BCoV infection is less prevalent on domestic goat farms in Gyeongsang and Jeonla Provinces.

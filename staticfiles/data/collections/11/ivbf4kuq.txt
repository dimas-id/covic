COVID-19 is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by a coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, dry cough, fever, and in some patients, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. 312,009 deaths from COVID-19 has been reported as of today. While respiratory symptoms are commonly caused by the infection, the use of mechanical ventilation is required for some patients. The following is intended to review the development and testing of a 3D printed and open-source mechanical ventilation device that is capable of adjusting breathing rate, volume, and pressure simultaneously and was designed according to the latest clinical observations of the current pandemic. The intuitive design of this device along with the use of primarily 3D printed or readily available components allow the rapid manufacturing and transportation of this ventilation device to the impacted regions.

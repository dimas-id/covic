To synthesise the literature on nutrition care for prediabetes from both the perspective of healthcare providers and patients, six databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus and ProQuest) were searched to identify qualitative or quantitative studies that focussed on nutrition care and prediabetes in primary care practice. Studies examining the perspectives of patients with prediabetes and healthcare providers were included. Outcomes of interest included knowledge of nutrition care for prediabetes, attitudes around providing or receiving nutrition care and actual nutrition care practices for prediabetes. Overall, 12851 studies were screened and 26 were included in the final review. Inductive analysis produced five themes: (i) nutrition care is preferable to pharmacological intervention; (ii) patients report taking action for behaviour change; (iii) healthcare providers experience barriers to nutrition care; (iv) healthcare providers tend not to refer patients for nutrition care; and (v) there are contradictory findings around provision and receipt of nutrition care. This review has revealed the contradictions between patients' and healthcare providers' knowledge, attitudes and practices around nutrition care for prediabetes. Further research is needed to shed light on how to resolve these disconnects in care and to improve nutrition care practices for people with prediabetes.

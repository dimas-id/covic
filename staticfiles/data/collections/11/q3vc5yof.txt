Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers the possibility to monitor both host and pathogens transcriptomes at the cellular level. Here, public scRNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster have been used to compare the differences in replication strategy and cellular response between two viruses, Thika virus (TV) and D. melanogaster Nora virus (DMelNV) in enteroendocrine cells (EEs). TV and DMelNV exhibited different patterns of replication and for TV, accumulation varied according to cell subtype. Cells infected with TV underwent down-regulation of genes that represent bottlenecks in the fruit fly interactome, while cells infected with DMelNV went through a down-expression of translation-related genes that represent both hubs and bottlenecks in the host interactome. In contrast, flies infected with DMelNV show only a systemic level down-regulation of bottleneck genes. Here, we use scRNA-seq to highlight the differences and commonalities between cellular response to TV and DMelNV and between cellular and systemic response to DMelNV.

Severe, organ-threatening and life-threatening manifestations of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the context of small vessel vasculitis, sometimes inadequately respond to immunosuppressive treatment. In the case of an immanent or already occurring organ failure, immunosuppressive treatment may need to be supplemented with rapidly effective rescue treatment procedures. Due to the rarity of many rheumatic diseases, the evidence for the use of rescue treatment, such as plasmapheresis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), is relatively low for many indications. The use of plasmapheresis is considered useful in acute anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Goodpasture’s syndrome) or catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). The use of ECMO treatment may be considered for persistent respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Administration of IVIG is indicated for acute cardiac involvement in Kawasaki’s disease and may be considered in catastrophic APS and refractory myositis.

Abstract Recently, an increasing number of patients of SARS-CoV-2 with syndrome which overlaps with Kawasaki Disease (KD) has been reported, supporting the idea that infection is one of triggers of KD. We summarized the reports of simultaneous familial KD cases for understanding etiopathogenesis of both KD and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19. Here we discuss the etiology of these syndromes from the point of view of infection and genetic susceptibility.

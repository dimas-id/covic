Mobile phones have become an integral part of human lives with majority of people using them to access product and services for their day-to-day needs. However, mobile shopping adoption across the globe is not wide or fast as expected. In addition, the research is very scant in understanding various predictors of consumer adoption towards mobile shopping. The objective of this study is to identify most significant and non-significant predictors of consumer mobile shopping acceptance. Systematic review and weight analysis on 34 mobile shopping studies revealed researchers mostly employed TAM and UTAUT model as theoretical lens. This study found an interesting revelation that extrinsic motivation variables such as social influence and perceived usefulness determine consumer mobile shopping behavioral intention during early stages. However, in later stages intrinsic motivation variables such as satisfaction and trust play crucial role to emerge as best and promising predictor of consumer continuous intention respectively.

Cell-mediated immunity was evaluated in intestinal, respiratory, and systemic lymphoid tissues of pigs exposed when 11 days old to virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), attenuated TGEV, or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), 3 antigenically related porcine coronaviruses with distinct enteric and respiratory tissue tropisms. Mononuclear cells were prepared from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), bronchial lymph nodes (BLN), and spleens of pigs and tested for virus-specific responses by use of lymphocyte proliferation assays. Vigorous MLN and BLN proliferation responses to virulent TGEV and PRCV, respectively, at postinoculation days 8 to 24 were strongly associated with prior detection of TGEV in rectal swab samples and PRCV in nasal swab samples. Gastrointestinal disease and intestinal virus replication, assessed on the basis of rectal virus shedding, were almost exclusively found in the virulent TGEV-inoculated pigs, even though virulent TGEV and a high dose of attenuated TGEV elicited the highest proliferation responses in MLN. Pigs exposed to PRCV or attenuated TGEV did not have clinical signs of disease, and only 1 pig given a high dose of attenuated TGEV shed virus in feces. Porcine respiratory coronavirus replicated in the respiratory tract after either oronasal or aerosol inoculation of virus and induced strong BLN, but not MLN, proliferation responses. A high dose of attenuated TGEV (4 x 10(8) plaque-forming units) was more effective than a lower dose of attenuated TGEV (7 x 10(6) plaque-forming units) in eliciting significant lymphocyte proliferation in MLN and BLN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

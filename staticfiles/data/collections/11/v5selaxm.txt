Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a form of acute myeloid leukemia, is characterized by cell differentiation arrest at the promyelocyte stage. Current therapeutic options include administration of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), but this treatment produces many side effects. ATRA is known to induce differentiation of leukemic cells into granulocytes, but the mechanism of this process is poorly studied. We performed comparative proteomic profiling of HL-60 promyelocytic cells at different stages of ATRA-induced differentiation to identify differentially expressed proteins by high-resolution mass spectrometry and relative quantitative analysis without isotope labels. A total of 1162 proteins identified by at least two unique peptides were analyzed, among them 46 and 172 differentially expressed proteins were identified in the nuclear and cytosol fractions, respectively. These differentially expressed proteins can represent candidate targets for combination therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

We present in this work some results from analysing the spread of Covid-19 in different countries and regions around the world and the potential relations with climate, geographical location, and GDP. While the situation remains dynamic, we believe this analysis has the potential to uncover certain underlying trends. We primarily intend the results to drive further, more detailed analysis of the relevant data by other researchers that would help us gather a better understanding of the situation, aiding our preparedness. Our observations show that countries in high latitudes, with temperate and/or continental climate, and with reasonably"open"economies are the most vulnerable to this outbreak.

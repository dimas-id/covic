The aim of this study was to describe a ventral laparoscopic technique for bilateral medial iliac lymphadenectomy in dogs. Twelve intact male purpose-bred research dogs, weighing less than 15 kg, were positioned in dorsal recumbency, and a 3-portal technique was used. Bilateral dissection was performed with vessel-sealing devices while tilting the surgical table by up to 30° towards the contralateral side of the target medial iliac lymph node (MILN) without changing the surgeon's position. Using a ventral laparoscopic approach, bilateral MILNs were identified and excised in all dogs. The mean times for unilateral and bilateral MILN dissections were 9.7 ± 3.8 and 21.0 ± 6.0 min, respectively. The mean times for the right and left MILN dissections were 10.8 ± 4.3 and 9.8 ± 2.5 min, respectively. The mean total surgery time was 43.7 ± 7.7 min. In total, 26 MILNs were dissected. Several complications, including mild to moderate capillary hemorrhage from perinodal fat and vessels (controlled laparoscopically), mild spleen trauma caused by the first trocar insertion and capsular damage of MILNs, were observed. However, there were no other major complications. All MILN samples were evaluated and deemed suitable for histopathologic diagnosis. Laparoscopic excision of MILNs is a useful method of excisional biopsy for histopathologic diagnosis. Using this ventral laparoscopic approach with the 3-portal technique, bilateral MILN dissection suitable for obtaining histopathologic samples could be achieved in a short time in dogs weighing less than 15 kg.

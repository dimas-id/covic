The focus of this article is on the dynamics of a new susceptible-infected model which consists of a susceptible group ($S$) and two different infectious groups ($I_1$ and $I_2$). Once infected, an individual becomes a member of one of these infectious groups which have different clinical forms of infection. In addition, during the progress of the illness, an infected individual in group $I_1$ may pass to the infectious group $I_2$ which has a higher mortality rate. In this study, positiveness of the solutions for the model is proved. Stability analysis of species extinction, $I_1$-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium as well as disease-free equilibrium is studied. Relation between the basic reproduction number of the disease and the basic reproduction number of each infectious stage is examined. The model is investigated under a specific condition and its exact solution is obtained.

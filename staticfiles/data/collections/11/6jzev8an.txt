Among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), rapidly re-establishing normal coronary blood flow is of paramount importance. More than 25 % of hospitals in the USA do not have access to timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention, highlighting the need for clinicians to understand both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies for STEMI. This manuscript reviews the current state of the art in STEMI care, describing both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic strategies for reperfusion.

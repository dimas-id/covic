We report here the complete genome sequence of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain CH/ZMDZY/11 isolated from central China. Our data, together with sequence data of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) isolates from other parts in China, will help to understand better the epidemiology and genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates in China.

Tilted Dirac/Weyl fermions admit a geometric description in terms of an effective spacetime metric. Using this metric, we formulate the hydrodynamics theory for tilted Dirac/Weyl materials in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions. We find that the mingling of spacetime through the off-diagonal components of the metric gives rise to: (i) heat and electric currents proportional to the {\em temporal} gradient of temperature, $\partial_t T$ and (ii) a non-zero Hall condductance $\sigma^{ij}\propto \zeta^i\zeta^i$ where $\zeta^j$ parametrizes the tilt in $j$'th space direction. The finding (i) above suggests that naturally available sources of $\partial_t T$ in hot deserts can serve as new concept for the extraction of electricity from the spacetime geometry. We find a further tilt-induced non-Drude contribution to conductivity which can be experimentally disentangles from the usual Drude pole.

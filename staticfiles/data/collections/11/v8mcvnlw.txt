COVID-19 has created a devastating pandemic, infecting more than 200 countries in its wake, only sparing Antarctica. The virus dissociates ferrous ion from the porphyrin ring of heme of haemoglobinâ€”thus hampering the oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lung and tissue. The toxic effect of ferrous (Fe(2+)) ions and carbon dioxide causes lung damage giving rise to severe respiratory distress and an often observed clotting disorder. Serum ferritin level is increased along with the rise of serum LDH, d-dimer, serum IL-6 and cardiac troponin. Associated leukocytosis, occasional lymphocytopenia and radiological changes of the lung are the pathological hallmarks of the disease. All these parameters including other clinical data such as age, fever, gender and associated co-morbidities may be used as a Risk Assessment tool for COVID-19 before the report of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) is available. A timely intervention can contribute to rescuing millions from an untimely death.

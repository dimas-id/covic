BACKGROUND The outcomes following laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) in elderly patients have not been widely reported to date. This study aimed to analyze perioperative and oncologic outcomes in patients aged ≥70 years (elderly group) and compare with those <70 years (non-elderly group). METHODS From April 1997 to September 2015, 402 consecutive patients with lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas underwent LDP at Rikshospitalet, Oslo University Hospital. RESULTS Of these, 118 (29.4%) were elderly, whereas 284 (70.6%) were non-elderly. Despite higher rate of comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesiologists score (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), elderly patients had lower postoperative morbidity, pancreatic fistula (PF) and readmission rates, compared with non-elderly (P = 0.032, 0.001 and 0.025, respectively). Spleen-preserving LDP (SPLDP) resulted in similar postoperative outcomes in the two groups. Elderly patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) were comparable to non-elderly in terms of median and 3-year survival (20.2 vs. 19 months (P = 0.94, log-rank) and 26.7% vs. 34.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Both LDP and SPLDP are safe in patients aged ≥70 years, providing outcomes similar to those in younger group. Elderly patients with PDAC can benefit from LDP, since age itself is not associated with decreased survival after surgery.

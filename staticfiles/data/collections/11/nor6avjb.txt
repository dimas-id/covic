In a hospital affiliated long term care facility, we found an opportunity to interrupt a potential outbreak of COVID-19 using a point prevalence testing containment strategy and applying infection prevention and control best practices. Three serial point prevalence studies were conducted on all residents and employees in fourteen day intervals and percent positive was used as marker for effective infection control efforts. A multidisciplinary strike team from acute care was used to disseminate infection control education and support to long term care partners. These results highlight the need for swift identification and action in congregant high risk settings to prevent rapid spread and large scale outbreaks of COVID-19.

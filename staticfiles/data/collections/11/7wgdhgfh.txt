Viral pneumonia is an important cause of community acquired pneumonias (CAP). It's not only specific to childhood period. Although immunocompromised adults are susceptible; all young and healthy adults are at risk. Viral pneumonias are usually underestimated due to lack of diagnostic modalities so a clinician must be aware of. Co-infection of viruses and bacteria is not uncommon and can be mortal especially in a flu epidemic, therefore, in the absence of diagnostic tools initiating to anti-viral treatment without delay is important.

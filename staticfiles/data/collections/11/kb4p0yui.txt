SARS-CoV-2-related SARIs (severe acute respiratory infections) have a major impact on public health; moreover, healthcare workers (HCWs) are exposed to a high biological risk. The aim of this study was to show the prevention procedures in place in the University Hospital of Bari (Apulia Region, Southern Italy) to reduce this risk to HCWs, consisting of the enhancement of preventive measures and the activation of a report system to collect HCWs' contacts. To date, 23 confirmed cases of infections (0.4% of all HCWs) have been reported in a 30-day observation period. These results show that correct management of HCWs' contacts is essential to avoid nosocomial clusters.

PURPOSE The published data on the outcomes of an operative repair for stoma prolapse are limited. This study aimed to clarify the long-term outcomes of stapler repair with anastomosis for stoma prolapse. METHODS Twenty-four patients (15 men, median age 64 years, range 33-88 years) undergoing 25 stapler repairs with anastomosis were prospectively registered, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS The median length of prolapse was 10 cm (range 5-22). Stoma prolapse repair was performed by means of 16 loop colostomies, four end colostomies, three loop ileostomies, and one end ileostomy. A stapler was used 4.6 times on average (range 4-8). The average operative time and bleeding were 40.8 (range 15-75) min and 40 (range 0-214) mL, respectively. No mortality and morbidity were observed after surgery. A recurrence of stoma prolapse was reported in only one of 25 repairs (4%) at the proximal limb of loop ileostomy during a median follow-up period of 1 year (range 1-120 months). However, a new stoma prolapsed in one untreated limb of loop stoma. CONCLUSIONS Stapler repair with anastomosis is a safe and minimally invasive treatment option for stoma prolapse with a low recurrence. However, the effectiveness of reparing stoma prolapse on the proximal limb of loop ileostomy might be limited.

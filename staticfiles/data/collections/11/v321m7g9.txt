Abstract The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the haemocytes of shrimps Fenneropenaeus chinensis (Osbeck) and Marsupenaeus japonicus (Bate) was studied after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection to determine its characteristics in response to virus infection. First, the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined by the means of NBT reduction and changes in cell conformation. And the variations of NOS activity in shrimps after challenge with WSSV intramuscularly were evaluated through the analysis of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate (both as NO derivates) concentrations. The result showed that NOS activity in the haemocytes of F. chinensis increased slightly from 0 to 12h postchallenge, indicated by the variations of l-citrulline (from 11.15±0.10 to 12.08±0.64μM) and total nitrite/nitrate concentrations (from 10.45±0.65 to 12.67±0.52μM). Then it decreased sharply till the end of the experiment (84h postchallenge), the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 84h were 1.58±0.24 and 2.69±0.70μM, respectively. The LPS-stimulated NOS activity kept constant during the experiment. However, in M. japonicus, the NOS activity kept increasing during the first 72h postchallenge, the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate increased from 7.82±0.77 at 0h to 10.79±0.50μM at 72h, and from 8.98±0.43 at 0h to 11.20±0.37μM at 72h, respectively. Then it decreased till the end of the experiment (216h postchallenge), and the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 216h were 5.66±0.27 and 4.68±0.16μM, respectively. More importantly, an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity was observed in M. japonicus at 48h postchallenge, which was about 4 times higher than that in the control group of health shrimps. In correspondence with the difference of NOS activity between the two species of shrimps, the cumulative mortalities of the shrimps were also different. All shrimps of F. chinensis in the mortality experiment died in 66h, much more quickly than M. japonicus, whose accumulative mortality reached 100% after 240h. Data here reported let us hypothesize that NOS activity in the haemocytes of shrimps F. chinensis and M. japonicus responses to WSSV infection differently, and this might be one of the reasons for the different susceptibility of F. chinensis and M. japonicus to WSSV infection.

Abstract The rapid propagation of SARS-CoV-2 requires the generation of evidence to help mitigate its global damage. The precise measurement with the appropriate clinical and epidemiological indicators associated with COVID-19 is a necessary step in reducing the individual and population burden of the current pandemic. These unprecedented times have raised a challenge for epidemiologists of chronic diseases and have required a practical approach “to do something to help during this disaster”. The options include returning to clinical care or resorting to online textbooks and resources for accelerated courses on the research of outbreaks. However, being aware of the magnitude of individual suffering endured by so many, including many esteemed and close colleagues, becomes a personal challenge of enormous proportions. The arts and other forms of humanities can help re-establish equilibrium, both during the pandemic and especially after it.

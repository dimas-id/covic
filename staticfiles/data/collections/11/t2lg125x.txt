Filtration efficiency (FE), differential pressure (&#916;P), quality factor (QF) and construction parameters were measured for 32 cloth materials (14 cotton, 1 wool, 9 synthetic, 4 synthetic blends, and 4 synthetic/cotton blends) used in cloth masks intended for protection from the SARS CoV-2 virus (diameter 100 Â± 10 nm). Seven polypropylene-based fiber filter materials were also measured, including surgical masks and N95 respirators. Additional measurements were performed on both multi-layered and mixed-material samples of natural, synthetic, or natural-synthetic blends to mimic cloth mask construction methods. Materials were micro-imaged and tested against size selected NaCl aerosol with particle mobility diameters between 50 nm and 825 nm. Three of the top five best performing samples were woven 100% cotton with high to moderate yarn counts and the other two were woven synthetics of moderate yarn counts. In contrast to recently published studies, samples utilizing mixed materials did not exhibit a significant difference in the measured FE when compared to the product of the individual FE for the components. The FE and &#916;P increased monotonically with the number of cloth layers for a lightweight flannel, suggesting that multi-layered cloth masks may offer increased protection from nanometer-sized aerosol with a maximum FE dictated by breathability (i.e. &#916;P).

Surgical site infections can have a devastating effect on a patient's morbidity impacting their quality of life and productivity in society. Financial burdens are placed on healthcare organizations because of surgical site infections as well. Evidence has shown that it is a worthwhile endeavor to implement a practice to screen and treat patients who are nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Implementing evidence-based practices to combat surgical site infections can help ensure quality healthcare, while producing best possible patient outcomes; however, getting evidence to the bedside can be a challenge. The Johns Hopkins nursing evidence-based practice model is designed to help nurses translate evidence into practice. This article describes the steps one community hospital took to implement an evidence-based practice using the Johns Hopkins model to decrease the likelihood of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus surgical site infections in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty.

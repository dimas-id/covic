Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were known to have excellent properties in cell therapy. However, the risk of immune rejection associated with cell transplant therapy hampers its use. Extracellular vesicles secreted by MSCs derived from different sources that contain therapeutic molecules such as RNA and proteins, which is a novel strategy for cell-free therapy. Recently, researches show EVs from MSCs (MSC-EVs) of different sources have special functions and effects on different diseases. Here, we collected these researches and compared them to each other. In addition, their potential and possible application in clinical treatment are described.

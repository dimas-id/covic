OBJECTIVES To assess the role of leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein (LRG) as a biomarker for monitoring systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (s-JIA) disease activity during interleukin (IL)-6 blockade treatment. METHODS We serially measured serum LRG levels in four s-JIA patients treated with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab and determined the correlation between clinical symptoms and other inflammatory biomarkers and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-18, IL-6, neopterin, and tumor necrosis factor-α receptor type I and II. The serum levels of LRG and proinflammatory cytokines were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Serum LRG levels increased concomitantly with s-JIA disease flare-up and macrophage activation syndrome development. Furthermore, even in the clinically inactive phase, serum LRG levels were well above normal values. There were no correlations between serum LRG levels and indicators of s-JIA disease activity other than aspartate aminotransferase. There were significant positive correlations between serum LRG levels and proinflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS Serum LRG levels might be a unique and potential biomarker of s-JIA disease activity during IL-6 blockade treatment.

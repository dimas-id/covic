DNAJC14 is an Hsp40 family member that broadly modulates flavivirus replication. The mechanism by which DNAJC14 stoichiometrically participates in flavivirus replication complex (RC) formation is unknown; both reduced and elevated levels result in replication inhibition. Using yellow fever virus (YFV), we demonstrate that DNAJC14 redistributes and clusters with YFV nonstructural proteins via a transmembrane domain and a newly identified membrane-binding domain (MBD), which both mediate targeting to detergent-resistant membranes. Furthermore, the RC and DNAJC14 reside as part of a protein interaction network that remains after 1% Triton solubilization. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that entry into this protein interaction network requires the DNAJC14 C-terminal self-interaction domain. Fusion of the DNAJC14 MBD and self-interaction domain with another Hsp40 family protein is sufficient to confer YFV-inhibitory activity. Our findings support a novel model of DNAJC14 action that includes specific membrane targeting of both DNAJC14 and YFV replication proteins, the formation of protein interactions, and a microdomain-specific chaperone event leading to RC formation. This process alters the properties of the RC membrane and results in the formation of a protein scaffold that maintains the RC.

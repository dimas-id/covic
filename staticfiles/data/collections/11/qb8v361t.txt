Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new viral disease that has gained global attention owing to its ability to provoke community and health-care-associated outbreaks of severe infections in human populations. The virus poses serious challenges to clinical management because there are still no approved anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs available. In this mini-review, we summarize the much updated published reports that demonstrate the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, and discuss the availability and development of attractive host-based therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 infections.

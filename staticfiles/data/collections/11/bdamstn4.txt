BACKGROUND Adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is crucial for the successful treatment of sleep-disordered breathing. The aim of our study was to analyze the adherence of children to long-term home CPAP/NIV treatment. METHODS We analyzed data from all consecutive patients older than the age of 2years, in whom CPAP/NIV treatment was initiated in a specialized pediatric NIV and in those who were receiving CPAP/NIV treatment at home for at least 1month. Data of the memory cards of the ventilators and nocturnal gas exchange were analyzed during a routine CPAP/NIV overnight control in the hospital. CPAP/NIV adherence during the previous month was analyzed according to patient's age, ventilatory mode, type of interface, nocturnal gas exchange, and duration of treatment. RESULTS The data of 62 children (mean age, 10±5years) with obstructive sleep apnea (n=51) treated with CPAP and neuromuscular disease (n=6) or lung diseases (n=5) treated with NIV were analyzed. Mean adherence was 8:17±2:30h:min per night, and the results did not significantly differ between CPAP and NIV adherence. Seventy-two percent of the patients used their device >8h per night. The mean number of nights of CPAP/NIV use during the last month was 26±5 nights per month. Treatment adherence was not correlated to age, the type of underlying disease, the type of interface (nasal, facial mask, or nasal cannula), nocturnal gas exchange, and duration of CPAP/NIV treatment. CONCLUSION Long-term CPAP/NIV adherence at home was extremely high in this group of children followed in a pediatric NIV unit. This finding may explain the lack of effect of the interface, nocturnal gas exchange, and duration of CPAP/NIV treatment.

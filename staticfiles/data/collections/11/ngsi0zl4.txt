The role of platelets as inflammatory cells is now well established. Given the peculiar characteristics of the lung circulation, with a broad capillary bed, platelets are especially involved with the physiology of the lungs and play a key role in a number of inflammatory lung disorders. The platelet precursors, megakaryocytes, are detected in the lung microcirculation; moreover platelets with their endothelium-protective and vascular reparative activities contribute to the lung capillary blood barrier integrity. Given the function of the lungs as first wall against pathogen invasion, platelets participate in immune defence of the normal lung. On the other hand, platelets may turn into effectors of the inflammatory reaction of the lungs to allergens, to infectious agents, to chemical agents and may contribute strongly to the perpetuation of chronic inflammatory reactions, largely by their ability to interact with other inflammatory cells and the endothelium. In this chapter we provide an overview of the role of platelets in several inflammatory lung disorders discussing the pathophysiologic bases of platelet involvement in these conditions and the experimental and clinical evidence for a role of platelets in lung diseases.

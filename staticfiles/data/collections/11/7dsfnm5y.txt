To help bridge the increasing gap between health scientists/physicians and the community, we have developed a new seminar program—Health Café series. Health Café takes place in causal settings, is open to everyone, and features a keynote speaker regarding prevalent healthcare-related topics. Health Café topics are usually generated via community feedback and are coordinated in partnership with local nonprofit community organizations. The Health Café series is completely free, and no prior knowledge is required to attend seminars. We have been collaborating with a web of community organizations in the Hartford areas of Connecticut, especially among populations with health disparities. We believe our new Health Café series program would serve as a forum to reduce health disparities in the region.

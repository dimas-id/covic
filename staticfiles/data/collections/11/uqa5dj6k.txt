The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought a great threat to global public health. Currently, mounting evidence has shown the occurrence of neurological symptoms in patients with COVID-19. However, the detailed mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 attacks the brain is not well characterized. Recent investigations have revealed that a cytokine storm contributes to brain inflammation and subsequently triggers neurological manifestations during the COVID-19 outbreak. Targeting brain inflammation may provide significant clues to the treatment of neurologic complications caused by SARS-CoV-2. Vascular growth factor (VEGF), which is widely distributed in the brain, probably plays a crucial role in brain inflammation via facilitating the recruitment of inflammatory cells and regulating the level of angiopoietins II (Ang II). Also, Ang II is considered as the products of SARS-CoV-2-attacking target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Further investigation of the therapeutic potential and the underlying mechanisms of VEGF-targeted drugs on the neurological signs of COVID-19 are warranted. In any case, VEGF is deemed a promising therapeutic target in suppressing inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological symptoms.

The discovery of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] in 1988 represented the first deviation from the traditional biochemical cascade of forming bioactive angiotensin peptides. Prior to that time, the biological actions of angiotensin II (Ang II) were being investigated as it relates to cardiovascular function, including hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and failure, as well as biological actions in the brain and kidney. We now know that Ang II elicits a whole host of actions both within and outside of the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, the discovery of Ang-(1-7) by our laboratory was also the first indication of a biologically active angiotensin peptide that further studies revealed served to counter-balance the actions of Ang II. This chapter reviews the data demonstrating the role of the vasodepressor axis of the renin angiotensin system in the regulation of cardiovascular function and the new data that shows the existence of angiotensin-(1-12) as a novel alternate substrate for the production of angiotensin peptides. The ultimate role of this discovery, as well as the continuing elucidation of mechanisms pertaining to RAS physiology, will likely be clarified in the coming years, in hopes of improving the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

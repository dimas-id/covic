Accurate analysis and interpretation of veterinary samples may be hampered by differences in sample matrix, compared with human samples. In addition to differences in sample collection methods, abnormal findings include lipemia, hemolysis, icterus, higher protein concentrations, and different therapeutic drug concentrations. Although many of these findings are similar to those in human sample testing, significant differences are present that affect several areas of the laboratory.

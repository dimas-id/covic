Abstract Polysaccharides play multiple roles and have extensive bioactivities in life process and an immense potential in healthcare, food and cosmetic industries, due to their therapeutic effects and relatively low toxicity. This review describes their major functions involved in antitumor, anti-virus, and anti-inflammatory bioactivities. Due to their enormous structural heterogeneity, the approaches for isolation and purification of polysaccharides are distinct from that of the other macromolecules such as proteins, etc. Yet, to achieve the homogeneity is the initial step for studies of polysaccharide structure, pharmacology, and its structure-activity relationships. According to the experiences accumulated by our lab and the published literatures, this review also introduces the methods widely used in isolation and purification of polysaccharides.

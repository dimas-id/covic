Abstract We compared a multiplex PCR diagnostic approach against specific PCR diagnosis for detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Seventy-five percent of all M. pneumoniae infections were only detected “unintentionally” by the use of the multiplex PCR indicating underdiagnosing of M. pneumoniae due to absence of clinical suspicion.

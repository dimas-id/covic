Mathematical models are being used extensively in the study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, becoming an essential tool for decision making concerning disease control. It is now required to understand the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the virus and the immune response effector cells, both innate and adaptive, in order to support lines of research related to the use of drugs, production of protective antibodies and of course, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The present study, using a system dynamic approach, hypothesizes over the conditions that characterize the fraction of the population which get infected by SARS-CoV-2 as the asymptomatic patients, the mild symptomatic, acute symptomatic, and also super-spreaders, in terms of innate immune response, the initial virus load, the virus burden with shedding events, and the cytokine levels.

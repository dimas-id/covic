BACKGROUND: Although respiratory tract infections represent a frequent cause of morbidity in travelers, and pneumonia a frequent cause of medical consultation among febrile travelers returning home, the etiologic spectrum of pneumonia in travelers has not been specifically studied. METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of all travelers hospitalized during a 12-month period in our department with pneumonia after returning home. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (nine men, eight women, mean age 44 years, range 26 to 67 years) were included in this study. The etiology of pneumonia was established in 13 patients. Bacterial pneumonia was documented in 10 cases and was due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 2), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 2), Legionella pneumophila (n = 1), Coxiella burnetti (n = 1), Leptospira sp. (n = 1) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n = 3). Other etiologies included histoplasmosis, invasive schistosomiasis and dengue fever (one case each). CONCLUSION: These results show the wide range of causes of pneumonia among travelers returning from abroad.

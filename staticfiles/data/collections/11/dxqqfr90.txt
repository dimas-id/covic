The Joint Commission has released specific COVID‐19 resources for health care professionals and organizations on the front lines of this pandemic. The site also includes statements to support providers, including the use of face masks from home and the shortage of critical medical equipment. “As a mission‐driven organization, we are driven to help our entire health care community keep their teams and patients safe,” President and CEO of The Joint Commission Mark R. Chassin, M.D., said. “The situation is changing rapidly, and recommendations are changing with similar speed. We know that you have received a torrent of information. We will continue to update this library with only those resources and guidance that we believe to be particularly useful as we continue to navigate through this pandemic.” COVID‐19 resources can be found at https://www.jointcommission.org/-/media/tjc/documents/resources/patient-safety-topics/infection-prevention-and-hai/covid19/drchassin_032420.pdf.

INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a connective tissue disorder, which causes complex multi organ involvement. Neurological and cardiac manifestations have been well noted but complications such as status epilepticus and acute myocarditis with heart failure at presentation remains uncommon. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-year-old, previously healthy, South Asian, Sri Lankan female presented with status epilepticus and the seizures only responded to intravenous midazolam and thiopentone sodium. On the fourth day, she developed tachycardia and shortness of breath and was found to have cardiomyopathy with heart failure with an ejection fraction 40%. Along with a positive urinary sediment, a positive ANA with a very high level of ds-DNA and low C3 and C4 levels confirmed our suspicion of systemic lupus erythematosus. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Systemic lupus erythematosus presents in a variety of clinical presentations and the spectrum may range from unique to ubiquitous. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion specially when encountering atypical presentations with multi-organ involvement, especially when patients tend to be young females. Status epilepticus and myocarditis are uncommon manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus, and should be appreciated early, as if inappropriately managed would have a deleterious impact on mortality and morbidity.

In the past 10 years, laparoscopy has been challenged by robotic surgery; nevertheless, laparoscopic techniques are subject to continuous change. Ultrahigh definition is the next development in video technology, it delivers fourfold more detail than full high definition resulting in improved fine detail, increased texture, and an almost photographic emulsion of smoothness of the image. New 4K ultrahigh-definition technology might remove the current need for the use of polarized glasses. New devices for laparoscopy include advanced sealing devices, instruments with six degrees of freedom, ergonomic platforms with armrests and a chest support, and camera holders. A manually manipulated robot-like device is still at the experimental stage. Robot-assisted surgery has substantially revolutionized laparoscopy, increasing its distribution; however, robot-assisted surgery is associated with considerable costs. All technical improvements of laparoscopic surgery are extremely valuable to further simplify the use of classical laparoscopy.

There are two different olfactory systems in man: one for self-preservation (classical olfactory system) and one for the propagation of the species (vomeronasal system). Both systems have a considerable impact on subcortical centers and particularly on emotional reactions, but only stimulation of the classical olfactory system is consciously perceived. The stimulus threshold of both systems is extremely low, but that of the olfactory system varies strongly with the nutritional status. The anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology are described.

We read with interest the findings of Huang's et al.'s retrospective study which revealed an association between hypoalbuminaemia and mortality in COVID‐19. In response to their findings we have synthesised a structured summary of the literature in order to discuss conclusions that could be drawn collectively. Furthermore, the authors also discuss a potential therapeutic role for correction of this hypoalbuminaemia. We would like to consider the applicability and relevance of the existing literature concerning albumin infusion in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe sepsis, the principal causes of mortality in COVID‐19.

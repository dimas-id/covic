AIMS To evaluate long-term anatomical and functional outcomes of the transobturator-infracoccygeal hammock repair for complex genital prolapse with a porcine collagen-coated polypropylene mesh. METHODS A prospective observational study comparing pre- and postoperative outcomes, using pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) measurements, pelvic floor distress inventory (PFDI), and pelvic floor impact questionnaire (PFIQ) scores. RESULTS One hundred fourteen women with recurrent, advanced, or posthysterectomy genital prolapse were enrolled. During follow-up (median value 57 months), 101 patients were available for assessment. Overall anatomical success rate was 96%, with significant improvement in quality-of-life. Three patients experienced symptomatic recurrent posterior prolapse. Seven had persistent stress urinary incontinence. Mesh exposure occurred in 6.9% of cases, including an infected hematoma that required partial excision of the mesh. No severe adverse event or change in sexual function was observed. CONCLUSIONS The transobturator-infracoccygeal hammock is well tolerated with effective long-term anatomical and functional results for complex genital prolapse. In our experience and compared to the data of the literature, the use of collagen-coated versus uncoated polypropylene meshes seems to decrease local morbidity.

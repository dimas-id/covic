This is a rejoinder of Dr. Ian Mitroff's perspective titled "Corona Virus: A Prime Example of A Wicked Mess". While I agree with Dr. Mitroff on the complexity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the urgency to address it, I disagree with him on points related to the role of wet market in this specific outbreak and whether China had acknowledged the existence of the outbreak. I also consider key highlights of the outbreak are the importance of collaboration across national and state borders and a balance between privacy and public health under such situations.

A 56-year-old man presented with abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant. Computed tomography angiography showed the presence of an iliac axis dissection. Two Viabahn (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) covered stents were placed, starting from the beginning of the left common iliac artery to the iliac bifurcation, closing the proximal dissection tear in the left common iliac artery. A self-expandable EverFlex stent (EV3-Covidien, Plymouth, Minn) was then placed, bridging the covered stent and the left external iliac artery, covering the re-entry tear. There were no postoperative complications. During follow-up, we observed a progressive and complete thrombosis of the false lumen in 12 months.

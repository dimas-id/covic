Abstract Viral infections can be transmitted by various routes. At one extreme, airborne or droplet viral infections (e.g., varicella zoster, ebola) are highly contagious. Most viruses can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. Mass gatherings, clinical, and chronic care facilities may be hotspots for virus spread when transmission is via aerosols, droplets, or fomites (contaminated surfaces). Environmental factors which are often important for virus survival may include the ambient humidity, temperature, and pH of the environment they are in, so many viruses survive only a few hours in the environment and are often readily inactivated by common hygiene techniques, such as using soap and water, and some detergents, disinfectants, and antiseptics. Sexually transmitted viral infections, such as herpes simplex, are often transmitted by close mucosal contacts.

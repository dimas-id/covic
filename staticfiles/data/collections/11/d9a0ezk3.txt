The lack of effective therapies for end-stage lung disease validates the need for stem cell-based therapeutic approaches as alternative treatment options. In contrast with exogenous stem cell sources, the use of resident progenitor cells is advantageous considering the fact that the lung milieu is an ideal and familiar environment, thereby promoting the engraftment and differentiation of transplanted cells. Recent studies have shown the presence of multipotent 'mesenchymal stem cells' in the adult lung. The majority of these reports are, however, limited to animal models, and to date, there has been no report of a similar cell population in adult human lung parenchyma. Here, we show the identification of a population of primary human lung parenchyma (pHLP) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from intraoperative normal lung parenchyma biopsies. Surface and intracellular immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed that cultures do not contain alveolar type I epithelial cells or Clara cells, and are devoid of the following hematopoietic markers: CD34, CD45 and CXCR4. Cells show an expression pattern of surface antigens characteristic of MSCs, including CD73, CD166, CD105, CD90 and STRO-1. As per bone marrow MSCs, our pHLP cells have the ability to differentiate along the adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic mesodermal lineages when cultured in the appropriate conditions. In addition, when placed in small airway growth media, pHLP cell cultures depict the expression of aquaporin 5 and Clara cell secretory protein, which is identified with that of alveolar type I epithelial cells and Clara cells, respectively, thereby exhibiting the capacity to potentially differentiate into airway epithelial cells. Further investigation of these resident cells may elucidate a therapeutic cell population capable of lung repair and/or regeneration.

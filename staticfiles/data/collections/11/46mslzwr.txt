A reaction of 2-acetyl-3-acylaminobenzo[b]furans (9d–o) with Vilsmeier (VM) reagent afforded a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-{(E)-2-aralkenylbenzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazin-4-ylidene}acetaldehydes (5) with a characteristic exo-formylmethylene group on the oxazine ring. The Z-isomer was more stable than the E-isomer. The Z-isomers ((Z)-5) were reacted with phosphonate reagents under two different conditions to obtain various butadiene derivatives (12) containing benzo[b]furo[3,2-d][1,3]oxazine skeleton. Typical compounds (5 and 12) were evaluated for their anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity, antagonistic activity for the cysLT1 receptor and growth inhibitory activity for MIA PaCa-2 and MCF-7. Compounds 12f and 12j showed potent anti-osteoclastic bone resorption activity comparable to E(2) (17β-estradiol).

Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes develop from a series of bone-marrow-resident progenitors in which lineage potential is regulated by distinct transcription factors. Zeb2 is an E-box-binding protein associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and is widely expressed among hematopoietic lineages. Previously, we observed that Zeb2 expression is differentially regulated in progenitors committed to classical DC (cDC) subsets in vivo. Using systems for inducible gene deletion, we uncover a requirement for Zeb2 in the development of Ly-6Chi monocytes but not neutrophils, and we show a corresponding requirement for Zeb2 in expression of the M-CSF receptor in the bone marrow. In addition, we confirm a requirement for Zeb2 in development of plasmacytoid DCs but find that Zeb2 is not required for cDC2 development. Instead, Zeb2 may act to repress cDC1 progenitor specification in the context of inflammatory signals.

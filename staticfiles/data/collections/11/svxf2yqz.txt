On September 29, 2008, the Ravalli County Public Health Department (RCPHD) notified the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (MDPHHS) of a large-scale human exposure to a dead bat at an elementary school. On October 1, the bat was confirmed to be rabid, and on October 4, MDPHHS requested assistance from CDC in evaluating persons for rabies exposure. Of 107 persons assessed, only one person (1%) was recommended for rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in accordance with guidance from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP); however, 74 persons (68%) ultimately pursued rabies PEP. This report describes the incident and public health response, and highlights the importance of unified risk communication. After a potential large-scale exposure to rabies virus, guidance from clinicians should be consistent with ACIP recommendations to ensure appropriate use of rabies PEP.

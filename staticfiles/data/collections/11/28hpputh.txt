Recently developed flow diverters, such as the pipeline embolization device (PED), allow for safe and efficacious treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms, with high occlusion rates and a low incidence of complications. However, incomplete obliteration after PED treatment may lead to aneurysm regrowth and delayed rupture. Herein, we report a case of a partially thrombosed giant aneurysm of the cavernous internal carotid artery that showed progressive recanalization at 1-3 months after application of a PED. We monitored inflow volume in the aneurysm by computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and computed tomographic volumetric imaging (CTVI). Based on the imaging results, rather than applying additional PED, we decided to make the switch from a dual antiplatelet medication to low-dose aspirin alone at 3 months after the treatment; complete obliteration of the aneurysm was noted at 21 months. Similar to the findings in this unusual case, CTA and CTVI may be useful follow-up methods for optimal management of patients with giant intracranial aneurysms after PED treatment.

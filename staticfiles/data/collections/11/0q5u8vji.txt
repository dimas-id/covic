Objective: To determine if near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which is easier to obtain than Doppler ultrasonography (USG), may be used in accordance with Doppler USG to provide additional data for assessment of organ blood flow velocities in preterm infants with hemodynamically significant PDA. Study design: Thirty-one infants who were treated with ibuprofen for closure of PDA were monitored continuously with NIRS. Cerebral, mesenteric, and renal arterial blood flow velocities were measured with Doppler USG before and after the treatment. Results: While cerebral, mesenteric, and renal fractional oxygen extraction (FTOE) measurements decreased significantly (p = .042, p < .001, p < .001, respectively), NIRS measurements (p = .016, p < .001, p < .001, respectively) and mean blood flow velocities (p = .003, p = .011, p = .002, respectively) increased significantly after the treatment. There was a significant correlation between pretreatment cerebral and mesenteric FTOE and resistive index (RI) values (r = 0.45, p = .01, and r = 0.46, p = .01, respectively). However, no correlation was observed between renal FTOE values and renal RI (r = 0.33, p = .06). Posttreatment cerebral, renal, and mesenteric FTOE values correlated positively with corresponding RI (r = 0.41, p = .02; r = 0.39, p = .02; r = 0.65, p < 01; respectively). Pretreatment and posttreatment cerebral, mesenteric, and renal FTOE values and arterial mean velocities were inversely correlated (pretreatment: r = 0.69, p < .01; r = 0.72, p < .01; r = 0.77, p < .01; posttreatment: r = 0.54, p = .01; r = 0.69, p < .01; r = 0.38, p = .01; respectively). Conclusion: As Doppler and NIRS measurements correlated significantly, we concluded that NIRS might be used in monitoring organ blood flow in preterm infants with PDA, which may provide additional data for management of this condition.

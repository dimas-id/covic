OBJECTIVE To evaluate the incidence of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (HCMA) in dogs and cats in the ICU that had intermittent nasogastric tube (NGT) aspiration for up to 36 hours. DESIGN Prospective cohort study (December 2013 to October 2014). SETTING Privately owned emergency and referral teaching hospital. ANIMALS Forty-nine client-owned dogs and 16 client-owned cats. INTERVENTIONS Patients wherein NGT placement was recommended and client consent was obtained were included in the interventional group. Those with an NGT placed (NGT group) had the NGT aspirated every 4 hours. Patients for whom placement of a NGT was declined by the owner served as a reference group (NoNGT). Venous blood gas and electrolyte values were obtained every 12 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Thirty-five dogs and cats had an NGT placed. Thirty dogs and cats did not have an NGT placed. The serum venous blood gas and electrolyte changes were compared over time within the NGT group and between the NGT and NoNGT groups. No cases developed HCMA. In the NGT group, blood pH increased over time. There was no significant difference between the NGT and the NoNGT group in the average value of pH, HCO3- , base excess, chloride, or corrected chloride. Serum venous blood gas, chloride, and corrected chloride changes were not associated with the volumes of gastric fluid aspirated over time. CONCLUSIONS In this small population of dogs and cats, intermittent NGT aspiration was not associated with the development of HCMA over a period of up to 36 hours after NGT placement.

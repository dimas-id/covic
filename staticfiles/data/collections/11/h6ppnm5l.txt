Dialysis catheters continue to play a vital role in the delivery of hemodialysis to patients for both temporary vascular access, serving as a bridge to permanent access, and for long-term access for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). During the past decade, there has been an emergence of technological advancements in the design of dialysis catheters in an attempt to reduce catheter malfunction, decrease infection rates, and improve their long-term efficiency. New improvements in catheter design are aimed at translating into improved catheter performance. This review article summarizes some of the novel catheter designs developed within the last decade.

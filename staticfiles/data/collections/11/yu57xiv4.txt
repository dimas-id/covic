The acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the most frequent complications of sickle cell disease. It affects mostly young children and counts for one quarter of mortality in the young sickle cell disease (SCD) population. This retrospective study evaluates the impact of ACS among hospitalizations for other complications of SCD in patients at the University Childrens' Hospital Reine Fabiola (Brussels, Belgium) in order to isolate clinical conditions associated with a high risk of ACS development. The medical records of all SCD patients aged up to 18 years admitted for all SCD related acute complications over a period of 13 month have been reviewed. Two patient groups have been formed based on the presence of an ACS within the study period. Epidemiologic data, medical history, the clinical presentation at admission but also blood counts in steady state, at admission and along the hospital stay were compared for a total of 96 hospital stays. There is no difference for age or hemoglobin phenotype between the two major patient groups. Male sex and having had a previous ACS episode in the past were significantly more important in the group of patients hospitalized for ACS. Thoracic pain in an SCD patient who doesn't show typical ACS symptoms should be interpreted as a risk factor for ACS. In conclusion, male sex, medical history of at least one ACS and thoracic pain at hospital admission are associated with high risk of developing ACS.

How to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a typical global health question since the impact of HIV/AIDS is global and it cannot be ended without collaborative global effort. In this chapter, a new measurement system is introduced to inform HIV/AIDS control cross the globe. All countries with data available on area size, total population and total number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) were included, yielding a sample of 148 countries. Four indicators, including the total count, population-based p rate, geographic area-based g rate and population and geographic area-based pg rate were used as a 4D system to describe the global HIV epidemic. The total PLWH count provided data informing resource allocation for individual countries to improve HIV/AIDS care; and the top five countries with highest PLWH count were South Africa, Nigeria, India, Kenya, and Mozambique. Information from the remaining three indicators provided a global risk profile of the HIV epidemic, supporting HIV/AIDS prevention programming strategies. Five countries with highest p rates were Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zimbabwe; five countries with highest g rates were Swaziland, Malawi, Lesotho, Rwanda, and Uganda; and five countries with highest pg rates were Barbados, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malta, and Mauritius. According to pg rates, two HIV hotspots (south and middle Africa and Caribbean region) and one HIV belt across Euro-Asian were identified. In addition to HIV/AIDS, the 4D measurement system can be used to describe morbidity and mortality for many diseases across the globe. We recommend the use of this measurement system in research to address significant global health and epidemiologic issues.

Disinfectant activity of various biocidal agents against coronaviruses like ethanol (62â€“71%), sodium hypochlorite (0.1%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) can be regarded effective against 2019-nCoV as well. As no vaccine and antiviral therapies have been discovered for 2019-nCoV, prevention of further spread will viable option to control the ongoing and future outbreaks.

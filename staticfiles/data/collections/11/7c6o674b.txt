Abstract Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are closely related deadly zoonotic paramyxoviruses that have emerged and re-emerged over the last 10 years. In this study, a subunit vaccine formulation containing only recombinant, soluble, attachment glycoprotein from HeV (sGHeV) and CpG adjuvant was evaluated as a potential NiV vaccine in the cat model. Different amounts of sGHeV were employed and sG-induced immunity was examined. Vaccinated animals demonstrated varying levels of NiV-specific Ig systemically and importantly, all vaccinated cats possessed antigen-specific IgA on the mucosa. Upon oronasal challenge with NiV (50,000TCID50), all vaccinated animals were protected from disease although virus was detected on day 21 post-challenge in one animal. The ability to elicit protective systemic and mucosal immunity in this animal model provides significant progress towards the development of a human subunit vaccine against henipaviruses.

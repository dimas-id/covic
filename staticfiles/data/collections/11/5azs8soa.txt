The incidence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has been rising consistently in Pakistan, and the country is likely to experience another surge of cases in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. It is imperative to consider how the rising proportion of XDR-TB is best tackled during the pandemic; this includes finding a solution to the problem of non-adherence at the level of community-based healthcare, the utility and practicality of simultaneous testing for COVID-19 and TB, and reconciliation of the World Health Organization's recommendation of home-based treatment with the need for frequent monitoring of anti-tubercular therapy in XDR-TB. Operational research is needed expeditiously to bypass these limitations.

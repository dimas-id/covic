The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to preventive measures worldwide. With the decline of infection rates, less stringent restrictions for sports and exercise are being implemented. COVID-19 is associated with significant cardiovascular complications; however there are limited data on cardiovascular complications and long-term outcomes in both competitive (elite) athletes and highly active individuals. Based on different categories of disease severity (asymptomatic, regional/systemic symptoms, hospitalisation, myocardial damage, and/or myocarditis), in this point-of-view article we offer the (sports) cardiologist or sports physician in the Netherlands a practical guide to pre-participation screening, and diagnostic and management strategies in all athletes >16 years of age after COVID-19 infection.

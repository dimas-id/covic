The recent human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Given the effects of COVID-19 in pulmonary tissues, chest radiography imaging plays an important role for the screening, early detection and monitoring of the suspected individuals. Hence, as the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, there will be a greater reliance on the use of portable equipment for the acquisition of chest X-Ray images due to its accessibility, widespread availability and benefits regarding to infection control issues, minimizing the risk of cross contamination. This work presents novel fully automatic approaches specifically tailored for the classification of chest X-Ray images acquired by portable equipment into 3 different clinical categories: normal, pathological and COVID-19. For this purpose, two complementary deep learning approaches based on a densely convolutional network architecture are herein presented. The joint response of both approaches allows to enhance the differentiation between patients infected with COVID-19, patients with other diseases that manifest characteristics similar to COVID-19 and normal cases. The proposed approaches were validated over a dataset provided by the Radiology Service of the Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru&ntildea (CHUAC) specifically retrieved for this research. Despite the poor quality of chest X-Ray images that is inherent to the nature of the portable equipment, the proposed approaches provided satisfactory results, allowing a reliable analysis of portable radiographs, to support the clinical decision-making process.

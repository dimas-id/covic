In this paper, we propose a method to visualize blood flow of palm in different muscle tense state using RGB high-speed camera. Recently, new modalities are needed to develop a more accurate system to non-contact multi-modal affect analysis. Then, we focus on muscle tense. The muscle tense is caused by stress. Hence, the muscle tense is one of the effective modalities for non-contact multi-modal affect analysis. However, it is very difficult to measure muscle tense in the real environment because it requires a contact-type sensor. Therefore, we use iPPG to visualize the pulse wave during muscle tense from the skin video taken with the RGB video camera. As a result of this experiment, we found that it was possible to recognize the difference in pulse wave during muscle tense from the video that visualized the pulse wave. From this result, the realization of non-contact measurement of muscle tense can be expected.

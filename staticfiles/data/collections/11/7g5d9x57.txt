The tests currently used for the direct identification of SARS-CoV-2 include specimens taken from the upper and the lower respiratory tract. In our paediatric department all children undergo both nasopharyngeal swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate, performed from both nostrils, on admission and after 24 hours. We decided to compare these two methods of detection of SARS-CoV-2. Considering nasopharyngeal aspirate as the gold standard, we calculated sensitivities and specificities of nasopharyngeal swab. Based on our results, we suggest to prefer the collection of aspirates whenever possible.

Rapid and simultaneous detection of multiple potential pathogens by portable devices can facilitate early diagnosis of infectious diseases, and allow for rapid and effective implementation of disease prevention and treatment measures. The development of a ZnO nanorod integrated microdevice as a multiplex immunofluorescence platform for highly sensitive and selective detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) is described. The 3D morphology and unique optical property of the ZnO nanorods boost the detection limit of the H5N2 AIV to as low as 3.6 × 10(3) EID(50) mL(−1) (EID(50): 50% embryo infectious dose), which is ≈22 times more sensitive than conventional enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. The entire virus capture and detection process could be completed within 1.5 h with excellent selectivity. Moreover, this microfluidic biosensor is capable of detecting multiple viruses simultaneously by spatial encoding of capture antibodies. One prominent feature of the device is that the captured H5N2 AIV can be released by simply dissolving ZnO nanorods under slightly acidic environment for subsequent off‐chip analyses. As a whole, this platform provides a powerful tool for rapid detection of multiple pathogens, which may extent to the other fields for low‐cost and convenient biomarker detection.

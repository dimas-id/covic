Abstract Water is in short supply with countries vying for access to river heads. Hong Kong (HK) is no different. It relies on supply from Mainland China with other cities rivalling access. Yet there is still no great impetus for water conservation. This paper reports on progress in setting up a pilot biological wastewater treatment plant and a PV-powered UV-LED disinfection system plus a feasibility study carried out in conjunction with a local developer investigating the application of the treated water for irrigation. The objective is to incorporate the systems within a small-scale community for its contribution to water and energy conservation as well as establish the parameters for replication in other countries with potential up-scaling for urban application.

Abstract Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device is an instrument that is used to acquire particular clinical information of patients in clinical as well as resource-limited settings. The conventional clinical diagnostic procedure requires high-end and costly instruments, an expert technician for operation and result interpretation, longer time, etc. that ultimately makes it exhausting and expensive. Although there are a lot of improvements in the medical facilities in the Indian healthcare system, the use of POC diagnostic devices is still in its nascent phase. This review illustrates the status of POC diagnostic devices currently used in clinical setups along with constraints in their use. The devices and technologies that are in the research and development phase across the country that has tremendous potential to elevate the clinical diagnostics scenario along with the diagnosis of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are emphasized. The implications of using POC diagnostic devices and the future objectives for technological advancements that may eventually uplift the status of healthcare and related sectors in India are also discussed here.

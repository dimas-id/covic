The serological prevalence of 13 murine viruses was surveyed among 103 wild-caught and 51 captive-bred house mice (Mus domesticus), originating from several trapping locations in northwest England, using blood samples obtained during routine health screening of an established wild mouse colony. A high proportion of recently caught wild mice were seropositive for mouse hepatitis virus (86%), mouse cytomegalovirus (79%), mouse thymic virus (78%), mouse adenovirus (68%), mouse parvovirus (59%) and minute virus of mice (41%). Seroprevalences of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), orthopoxvirus, reovirus-3 and murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4, also called murine gamma-herpesvirus [MHV-68]) were low (3-13%), and no animals were seropositive to Sendai virus, pneumonia virus or polyomavirus. Seroprevalence in wild-caught animals that had been in captivity for over six months was generally consistent with the range found in recently caught wild animals, while seroprevalence was generally much lower in captive-bred mice despite no attempt to prevent viral spread. A notable exception to this was LCMV, which appeared to have spread efficiently through the captive population (both captive-bred and wild-caught animals). Given the known viral life cycles in laboratory mice, it appears that viral persistence in the host was an important contributing factor in the spread of infection in captivity.

The cardiovascular safety of DPP4 inhibitors as a class, especially in regards to heart failure, has been questioned after the publication of first trials (SAVOR-TIMI 53 and EXAMINE) assessing the cardiovascular risks of DPP4 inhibitors alogliptin and sitagliptin in 2013. Although there were no increased risks in composite cardiovascular outcomes, the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial reported a 27% increase in hospitalization for heart failure in diabetic patients who received the DPP4 inhibitor saxagliptin. There has been substantial increase in knowledge on the heart failure effect of DPP4 inhibition since 2013. This review will summarize the role of the DPP4/incretin axis in heart failure and discuss the findings from recent large scale clinical trials assessing the effects of DPP4 inhibitors on heart failure.

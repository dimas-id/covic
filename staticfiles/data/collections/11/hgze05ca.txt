The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the management and prognosis of severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients. An observational cohort study of HIV-negative adults with PJP documented by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through Gomori–Grocott staining or immunofluorescence, admitted to one intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure, was undertaken. From 1990 to 2010, 70 patients (24 females, 46 males) were included, with a mean age of 58.6 ± 18.3 years. The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-II was 36.9 ± 20.4. Underlying conditions included hematologic malignancies (n = 21), vasculitis (n = 13), and solid tumors (n = 13). Most patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids (n = 63) and cytotoxic drugs (n = 51). Not a single patient received trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole as PJP prophylaxis. Endotracheal intubation (ETI) was required in 42 patients (60.0 %), including 38 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In-ICU mortality was 52.9 % overall, reaching 80.9 % and 86.8 %, respectively, for patients who required ETI and for patients with ARDS. In the univariate analysis, in-ICU mortality was associated with SAPS-II (p = 0.0131), ARDS (p < 0.0001), shock (p < 0.0001), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) on BAL (p = 0.0031). In the multivariate analysis, only ARDS was associated with in-ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] 23.4 [4.5–121.9], p < 0.0001). PJP in non-HIV patients remains a serious disease with high in-hospital mortality. Pulmonary co-infection with HSV or CMV may contribute to fatal outcome.

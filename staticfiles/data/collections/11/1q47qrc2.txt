Mobile learning is a methodology that involves the use of mobile devices to carry out the teaching-learning process. In exceptional situations such as that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, virtual training methods take on great importance, being the main route for the education of students. The purposes of this paper were to analyse the degree of implementation of the mobile learning methodology in Spanish universities and to check the sociodemographic factors that influence the development of good teaching practices in mobile learning. Ten hypothetical relationships were established and contrasted using a structural equation model. The sample was made up of 1544 university professors from 59 Spanish universities who were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to evaluate mobile learning practices. The results indicated that the degree of implementation of mobile devices was almost 73% of the population surveyed. While the sociodemographic factors that significantly influenced the development of good teaching practices were: teacher status; type of institution; educational technology research; implementing pedagogical innovations on a regular basis; agree that mobile devices are appropriate; belief in the expansion of mobile learning. Finally, the main findings and practical implications derived from the data obtained were discussed.

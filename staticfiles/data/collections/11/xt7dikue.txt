The radiation transport equation is a mesoscopic equation in high dimensional phase space. Moment methods approximate it via a system of partial differential equations in traditional space-time. One challenge is the high computational intensity due to large vector sizes (1 600 components for P39) in each spatial grid point. In this work, we extend the calculable domain size in 3D simulations considerably, by implementing the StaRMAP methodology within the massively parallel HPC framework NAStJA, which is designed to use current supercomputers efficiently. We apply several optimization techniques, including a new memory layout and explicit SIMD vectorization. We showcase a simulation with 200 billion degrees of freedom, and argue how the implementations can be extended and used in many scientific domains.

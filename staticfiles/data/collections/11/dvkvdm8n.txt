Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) primarily infects the upper respiratory tract. However, it may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection, and the clinical course may be severe in immunocompromised patients. To our knowledge, child death due to HCoV-NL63 has not been reported. We present a fatal lower respiratory tract disease associated with HCoV-NL63 in a 7-month-old malnourished infant.

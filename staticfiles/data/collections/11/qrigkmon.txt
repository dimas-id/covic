The Gypsy Database concerning Mobile Genetic Elements (release 2.0) is a wiki-style project devoted to the phylogenetic classification of LTR retroelements and their viral and host gene relatives characterized from distinct organisms. Furthermore, GyDB 2.0 is concerned with studying mobile elements within genomes. Therefore, an in-progress repository was created for databases with annotations of mobile genetic elements from particular genomes. This repository is called Mobilomics and the first uploaded database contains 549 LTR retroelements and related transposases which have been annotated from the genome of the Pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. Mobilomics is accessible from the GyDB 2.0 project using the URL: http://gydb.org/index.php/Mobilomics.

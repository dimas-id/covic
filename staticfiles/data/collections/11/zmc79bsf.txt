BACKGROUND: Since Rothenberg first performed thoracoscopic repair for esophageal atresia with distal tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) successfully in 2000, thoracoscopic repair has achieved status as a routine procedure worldwide. Previously, an international multicenter study reported that this procedure was not inferior to conventional open surgery. However, thoracoscopic surgery is a highly difficult operation for surgeons and anesthesiologists; as a result, the safety and efficacy of the surgery is still under debate. Considering these circumstances, the purpose of this study was to analyze the results of single-center thoracoscopic surgery and to compare the outcomes relative to the patient’s weight at the time of surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with EA/TEF who underwent thoracoscopic surgery in a single center between October 2008 and February 2017. RESULTS: In total, 41 cases of thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were performed. Upon subgrouping by over and under 2000 g of body weight at the time of operation, 34 were found to be over 2000 g and seven were under 2000 g. Intraoperative factors and events were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, most of the postoperative outcomes, including the rate of postoperative leakage and strictures, showed no difference. On the other hand, the under 2000 g group had more gastroesophageal reflux requiring fundoplication than did the heavier group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this center’s thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were not inferior to other centers’ outcomes. Additionally, the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were similar despite differences in weight at operation. Therefore, thoracoscopic repair might be a feasible surgical option for infants weighing less than 2000 g when performed by a surgeon and anesthesiologist team who are experienced in pediatric thoracoscopic surgery.

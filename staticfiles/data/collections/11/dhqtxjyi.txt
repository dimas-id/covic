Strongyloidosis is a parasitic disease of the intestines, seen mainly in tropical areas. It is quite likely that, because its manifestations are milder than those of other tropical diseases, it may be overlooked in regions where parasitic diseases such as hookworms and roundworms are endemic. With future improvements in hygiene and the resulting decreases in parasitic diseases, increasing attention will be focused on strongyloidiasis in tropical regions â€” a phenomenon currently being observed in Okinawa. Studies on the diagnosis and treatment of apparently healthy Strongyloides carriers have only just started. These studies can be expected to play a major role in improving the near-future health and welfare of people in tropical regions of the world. Parasitic diseases in Japan have a strong local character; a long-term eradication program, with due consideration to HTLV-1 infection, must be instituted.

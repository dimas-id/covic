OBJECTIVE To explore the feasibility of radical resection for cancer patients complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The management and clinical outcome of a sigmoid cancer patient with COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS The inflammation indicators and fever of this patient were effectively controlled and the lung lesions remained stable after active anti-viral treatment, then the radical colorectomy was performed after the viral negative conversion for twice. CONCLUSIONS The case indicates that radical resection can be performed in SARS-CoV-2 patients with twice-negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing results.

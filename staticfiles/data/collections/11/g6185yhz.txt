Abstract The article provides an overview of biosecurity measures that apply to all potential pathogens in the horse exemplified by the control and management of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (an emergent disease), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (a zoonotoc disease), and strangles in horses, an ancient disease that remains a scourge of susceptible Equidae. The emphasis is on infectious disease within the United States, although the principles of biosecurity in limiting infectious disease spread are not restricted by boundaries.

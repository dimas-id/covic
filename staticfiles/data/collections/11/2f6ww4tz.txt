Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an etiological agent of bovine respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a costly illness worldwide; thus, epidemiological surveys of BCoV are important. Here, we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey of BCoV in respiratory-diseased and healthy cattle in Japan from 2016 to 2018. We found that 21.2% (58/273) of the respiratory-diseased cattle were infected with BCoV. The respiratory-diseased cattle had virus amounts 4.7 times higher than those in the asymptomatic cattle. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the BCoV identified in Japan after 2005 formed an individual lineage that was distinct from the strains found in other countries. These results suggest that BCoV is epidemic and has evolved uniquely in Japan.

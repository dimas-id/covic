A 35-year-old man presented to his optician with sudden onset diplopia and a 1-week history of headaches. He was noted to have sixth nerve palsy. The following day he was admitted to hospital with confusion and expressive dysphasia. He had been due to travel to Ghana on business and had received yellow fever (YF) vaccination 18 days prior to onset of headaches. His initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed elevated protein, increased white cell count but was PCR negative for standard viral pathogens. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 was detected by PCR in CSF at a very low level from a second lumbar puncture performed 6 days later, and the patient was treated for HSV meningoencephalitis. However, retrospective investigation for yellow fever vaccine-associated neurological disease revealed increasing titres of YF IgG in three serial CSF samples, and no evidence of HSV antibodies in CSF or plasma, ruling out HSV encephalitis.

Hemorrhage is the leading cause of intraoperative deaths. Many cardiovascular and hepatobiliary procedures result in massive hemorrhage and postpartum hemorrhage events in labor and delivery place the patient at a high risk for mortality. Gastrointestinal bleeding from diverticulosis, varices, and ulcer disease can result in significant blood loss requiring massive transfusion and resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. Timely and effective transfusion of blood products is of critical in these scenarios. The frequency in which blood component products are transfused in surgical patients begs for a greater understanding of them. The aim of this chapter is to provide clinicians with a discussion of the current literature on the various blood component products, their indications, and unique hemostatic conditions in the surgical patient. While the majority of data concerning optimal management of acquired coagulopathy and hemorrhagic shock resuscitation is based on trauma patients, many of the principles can and should be applied to the surgical patient (or likely any patient) with profound hemorrhage.

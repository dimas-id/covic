Medicine will continue to become more personalized over the coming years. Beyond the availability of a central data repository in the form of an electronic patient record (ePA), the reaching of optimal diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions requires digital tools capable of handling the enormous flood of data. Accordingly, digitization of medicine is driven by three central developments: 1) better understanding of the biological basis of life, based on the wider use of DNA sequencing, 2) technological quantum leaps in computing and data storage coupled with ubiquitous access to data via smartphones; and 3) a considerable increase in patients’ desire for sovereignty based on increasing transparency and digital communication. Thus, the digitization of medicine is evolving into a means for better health care. Despite all technological advances, it is important to continue focusing on the human component—only a “humane digitization” strategy, which places benefits for patients as well as those providing treatment and care at its core, will realize their full potential.

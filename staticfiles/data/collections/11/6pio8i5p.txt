OBJECTIVE: Mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increased in COPD patients. Furthermore, higher body mass index (BMI) is related to severe disease. SARS-CoV-2 utilises angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain cellular entry. METHODS: We have investigated whether ACE2 bronchial epithelial expression is increased in COPD patients who are overweight compared to those who are not by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We observed increased ACE2 expression in COPD patients who are overweight (mean BMI 29 kg/m2 ) compared to those notoverweight (mean BMI 21 kg/m2 ) (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Increased ACE2 expression may cause increased SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory tract. COPD patients who are overweight may be at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19.

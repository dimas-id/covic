We present pygiftgenerator, a python module for systematically preparing a large number of numerical and multiple-choice questions for Moodle-based quizzes oriented to students' formative evaluation. The use of the module is illustrated by means of examples provided with the code and they cover topics from Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics and Modern Physics. The fact that pygiftgenerator relies on a well-established computer language which allows to combine and reuse functions in order to solve complex problems, makes it a very robust tool. Simply by changing the input parameters, a large question bank with solutions even to complex physical problems can be generated. Thus, it is a powerful alternative to the calculated and multiple choice questions which can be written directly in the Moodle platform. The module writes the questions to be imported into Moodle in a simple and human-readable ASCII output using the GIFT format, which enables html definitions for URLs for importing figures, or for simple text formatting (sub/superindices or Greek letters) for equations and units. This format also admits LaTeX typing for complex equations.

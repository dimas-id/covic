A number of advances in recent years have significantly furthered our understanding of filovirus attachment and cellular tropism. For example, several cell-surface molecules have been identified as attachment factors with the potential to facilitate the in vivo targeting of particular cell types such as macrophages and hepatic cells. Furthermore, our knowledge of internalization and subsequent events during filovirus entry has also been widened, adding new variations to the paradigms for viral entry established for HIV and influenza. In particular, host cell factors such as endosomal proteases and the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 are now known to play a vital role in activating the membrane fusion potential of filovirus glycoproteins.

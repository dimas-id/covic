Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has become a major global challenge. The virus infects host cells using its spike glycoprotein (S‐protein) and has significantly higher infectivity and mortality rates among the aged population. Here, based on bioinformatic analysis, I provide evidence that some members of the upper respiratory tract (URT) commensal bacteria express viral S‐protein ‐binding proteins. Based on this analysis and available data showing a decline in the population of these bacteria in the elderly, I propose that some URT commensal bacteria hamper SARS‐CoV‐2 infectivity and that a decline in the population of these bacteria contributes to the severity of infection. Further studies should provide a better understanding of the interaction of URT bacteria and SARS‐CoV‐2, which may lead to new therapeutic approaches.

Respiratory infections are the third highest cause of death worldwide and influenza has the highest mortality rate among lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Diagnosis of LRTIs relies mostly on clinical symptoms and is not fully satisfactory. Influenza laboratory diagnosis improves the efficiency of prophylaxis or treatment of influenza by antiviral molecules and has a strong impact on the cost-effectiveness of curative treatment. Inappropriate treatment of patients may result in spreading of resistant strains. Molecular diagnostics play a central role in the surveillance and response of pandemic influenza due to highly pathogenic strains. Real-time assays can be used for diagnosis or surveillance purposes in humans and animals, and microarrays can be used to identify and monitor the spread of dangerous variants. Molecular assays are also useful to identify and distinguish influenza, other respiratory viruses and bacteria, although their cost-effectiveness must be proven on a large scale. As new antiviral options will be available to clinicians, a better treatment choice will benefit the patient and community. Recent progress in molecular techniques will be reviewed. Examples of real-time assays for the detection of influenza viruses, including the highly pathogenic influenza A strains H5N1 and H7N7, will be discussed. Promising new techniques that allow detailed genotyping of viruses or multiplex detection of several respiratory pathogens from a unique specimen will also be discussed. These techniques will, in the near future, significantly improve the quality of diagnosis and surveillance of respiratory pathogens.

Population dynamics are often affected by sudden environmental perturbations. Parameters of stochastic models are often imprecise due to various uncertainties. In this paper, we formulate a stochastic multimolecular biochemical reaction model that includes L\'{e}vy jumps and interval parameters. Firstly, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the positive solution. Moreover, the threshold between extinction and persistence of the reaction is obtained. Finally, some simulations are carried out to demonstrate our theoretical results.

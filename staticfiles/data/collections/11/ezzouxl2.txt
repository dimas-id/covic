The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound impact on healthcare systems around the world. The emergency department (ED) in particular has become the frontline for the identification and care of these patients. While its effects on respiratory symptoms are well recognized, neurologic manifestations have been rarer. We report the case of a patient who presented in cardiac arrest with the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The patient was found to have subarachnoid hemorrhage and later tested positive for COVID-19.

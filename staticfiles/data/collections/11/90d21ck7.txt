The data on the outcomes of solid organ transplant recipients who have contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) are still emerging. Kidney transplant recipients are commonly prescribed renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (AAS) inhibitors given the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. As the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitates the entry of coronaviruses into target cells, there have been hypotheses that preexisting use of Renin‐Angiotensin‐Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors may increase the risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. Given the common use of RAAS inhibitors among solid organ transplant recipients, we sought to review the RAAS cascade, the mechanism of SARS‐CoV‐2 entry, and pertinent data related to the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 to guide management of solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID‐19 pandemic. At present there is no clear evidence to support the discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

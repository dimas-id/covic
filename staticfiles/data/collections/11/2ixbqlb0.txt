In this mini-review, we summarize the photochemical approaches for developing high-throughput carbohydrate microarray technologies. Newly established methods for photo-immobilizing unmodified monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides onto photoactive surfaces and coupling of photoactive carbohydrates onto polymer surfaces are reviewed.

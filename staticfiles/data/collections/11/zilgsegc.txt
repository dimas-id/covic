PURPOSE To investigate if drug-coated balloon (DCB) predilation may improve the efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) for restenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS Eighteen consecutive patients (11 men; median age 75 years) with significant restenosis within 24 months of CEA were treated with a paclitaxel-coated DCB prior to CAS. Clinical outcomes and stent patency were systematically appraised. RESULTS All patients were successfully treated according to this clinical protocol. The only complication occurred in a patient who had a transient ischemic attack during prolonged DCB inflation. At a median follow-up of 18 months, no >50% restenosis was observed on duplex ultrasound scans; however, moderate hyperplasia at the proximal stent edge was found in 4 patients. One patient died at 9 months from a myocardial infarction. CONCLUSION Despite the small sample size and in keeping with the historically high risk of recurrent restenosis after CAS for CEA restenosis, this case series suggests that DCB dilation followed by CAS for postsurgical restenosis is feasible, safe, and may be associated with favorable clinical outcomes at midterm follow-up.

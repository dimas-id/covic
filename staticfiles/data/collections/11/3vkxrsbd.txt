In this paper, we propose a model where two strains compete with each other at the expense of common susceptible individuals on heterogeneous networks by using pair-wise approximation closed by the probability-generating function (PGF). All of the strains obey the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) mechanism. From a special perspective, we first study the dynamical behaviour of an SIR model closed by the PGF, and obtain the basic reproduction number via two methods. Then we build a model to study the spreading dynamics of competing viruses and discuss the conditions for the local stability of equilibria, which is different from the condition obtained by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on Barabási–Albert networks to complement our theoretical research, and show some dynamical properties of the model with competing viruses.

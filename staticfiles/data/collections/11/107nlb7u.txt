The clinical introduction of double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) has brought about a revolution in the diagnosis and the treatment of diseases of the small intestine. DBE allows not only direct observation of the entire small intestine, but also interventional therapies, tissue sampling and India ink marking (tattooing). Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was developed from conventional laparoscopic surgery to further reduce the degree of invasiveness. SILS requires only one umbilical incision, thus resulting in almost scarless surgery. This report presents three cases of small intestinal bleeding successfully treated by SILS following tattooing under DBE. The average operative time was 67 min and average blood loss was 5 ml. All patients immediately recovered without any complications. SILS, in conjunction with presurgical tattooing by DBE for small intestinal bleeding is considered to be an ideal approach in terms of minimal surgical trauma and aesthetics.

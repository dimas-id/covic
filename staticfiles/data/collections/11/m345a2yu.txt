Acquisition of resistance mutations by HIV-1 isolates causes treatment failure among infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study determined patterns of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) among HIV-1 isolates from patients receiving first-line ART in South-eastern Nigeria. Blood samples were collected from HIV-1 infected patients accessing antiretroviral treatment centers at General Hospital Awo-Omamma, Imo state, State Hospital Asaba, Delta state and St Josephâ€™s Catholic Hospital Adazi, Anambra state and used for HIV-1 DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. DRMs were scored using combination of Stanford algorithm and the 2015 International Antiviral Society-USA list while drug susceptibility was predicted using Stanford algorithm. Twenty eight of the HIV-1 isolates were sequenced and identified as subtypes G (35.7%), CRF02_AG (57.1%) and unclassifiable, U(G) (7.1%). Major PI resistance-associated mutations were identified at two sites including M46L (16.7% of subtype G/U(G)) and V82L (6.3% of CRF02_AG). Minor PI resistance-associated mutations identified among subtype G/U(G) are L10V/I (8.3%) and K20I (100%) while L10V/I (50%), K20I (100%), L33F (6.3%) and N88D (6.3%) were identified among CRF02_AG. Other polymorphisms found include; I13V/A, E35Q, M36I/L, N37D/S/E/H, R57K/G, L63T/P/S/Q, C67E/S, H69K/R, K70R, V82I and L89M in the range of 28.6% to 100% among the different subtypes. Interpretation based on Stanford algorithm showed that Darunavir/ritonavir is the only regimen whose potency was not compromised by the circulating mutations. Identification of major and minor PI resistance mutations in this study underscores the need for drug resistance testing prior to initiation of second line antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria.

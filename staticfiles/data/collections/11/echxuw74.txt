Every individual text or document is generated for specific purpose(s). Sometime, the text is deployed to convey a specific message about an event or a product. Other occasions, it may be communicating a scientific breakthrough, development or new model and so on. Given any specific objective, the creators and the users of documents may like to know which part(s) of the documents are more influential in conveying their specific messages or achieving their objectives. Understanding which parts of a document has more impact on the viewerâ€™s perception would allow the content creators to design more effective content. Detecting the more impactful parts of a content would help content users, such as advertisers, to concentrate their efforts more on those parts of the content and thus to avoid spending resources on the rest of the document. This work uses a regularized attention-based method to detect the most influential part(s) of any given document or text. The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture based on attention-based decoder with regularization applied to the corresponding weights.

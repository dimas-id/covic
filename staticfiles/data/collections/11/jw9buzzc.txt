The ARF-like (ARL) proteins, within the ARF family, are a collection of functionally diverse GTPases that share extensive (>40 %) identity with the ARFs and each other and are assumed to share basic mechanisms of regulation and a very incompletely documented degree of overlapping regulators. At least four ARLs were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, along with one ARF, and these have been expanded to >20 members in mammals. We know little about the majority of these proteins so our review will focus on those about which the most is known, including ARL1, ARL2, ARL3, ARL4s, ARL6, ARL13s, and ARFRP1. From this fragmentary information we extract some generalizations and conclusions regarding the sources and extent of specificity and functions of the ARLs.

Minimally invasive approaches to esophageal leiomyoma, including thoracoscopic and laparoscopic enucleation, have been shown to have better postoperative recovery compared with thoracotomy approach. We present a case of robotic-assisted thoracoscopic enucleation of esophageal leiomyoma using the da Vinci(Â®) S system.

Researchers studying SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, have published another structure of a viral protein that could be a target for treatments, including Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir A team in China led by Zihe Rao at Tsinghua University reports the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is a key part of how the virus makes copies of its RNA genome (Science 2020, DOI: 10 1126/science abb7498) RdRp, along with the virus’s spike protein, which is involved in infecting human cells, and its main protease, which helps process viral protein production, is one of the main drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 Jason McLellan, the University of Texas at Austin researcher who in February published the first cryo-EM structure of the spike protein, says RdRp is the only other protein that he was interested in investigating But before he could start work on the protein, he saw that Rao’s

Dr. Jecko Trachil stressed a possibility of platelet consumption to form pulmonary thrombi in patients with DOVID-191 , which coincides with the theory, which we are working on right now, that pulmonary thrombi may be responsible for hypoxemia before typical acute respiratory distress syndrome develops2 , ie silent hypoxemia called by some experts3 . As for anti-platelet drugs attenuating thrombi formation, the balance would be too delicate to maintain, because they may block the platelet blocking viral invasion.

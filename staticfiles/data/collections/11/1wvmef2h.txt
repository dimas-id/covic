Background Chronic venous occlusion is common particularly in cancer patient due to hypercoagulate state associated with venous compression. Treatment options include endovascular management with venoplasty and stenting. Recanalization can be challenging in patients with complete venous occlusion secondary to significant external compression by a mass. Case presentation We report a case of a 73-year-old man with a history of bladder and prostate cancer who presented with worsening right leg edema and pain due to deep venous thrombosis secondary to a retroperitoneal mass. Management was sharp recanalization, venoplasty and stenting. Conclusion Endovascular intervention of chronic venous occlusion is technically challenging and time consuming. Sharp venous recanalization is feasible and safe in patients who failed standard recanalization procedures. We present a case of cancer-related obstruction of the right iliac veins and acute thrombosis of the femoral vein with symptomatic lower limb swelling relieved by sharp recanalization through the tumor mass.

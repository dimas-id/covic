RNA viruses use CpG reduction to evade the host cell defense, but the driving mechanism is still largely unknown. To address this, we used rapidly growing genomic dataset of SARS-CoV-2 with relevant metadata information. SARS-CoV-2 genomes show a progressive increase of C-to-U substitutions resulting in CpG loss over just a few months. This is consistent with APOBEC-mediated RNA editing resulting in CpG reduction, thus allowing the virus to escape ZAP-mediated RNA degradation. Our results thus link the dynamics of target sequences in viral genome for two known host molecular defense mechanisms, the APOBEC and ZAP proteins.

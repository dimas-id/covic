We consider the syndromic surveillance problem for enterovirus (EV) like cases. The data used in this study are the daily counts of EV-like cases sampled from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. To apply the CUSUM procedure for syndromic surveillance, a regression model with time-series error-term is used. Our results show that the CUSUM chart is helpful to detect abnormal increases of the visit frequency.

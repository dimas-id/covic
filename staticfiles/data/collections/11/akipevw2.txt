BACKGROUND: The duration of viral shedding is central to guide the decisions of isolation precautions and antiviral treatment. However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. METHODS: Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction conversion at the No.3 People's Hospital of Hubei province between 31 January and 09 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52â years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23â days (IQR, 18-32â days). Older age (odd ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.05, p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36, p=0.029) were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10â days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19â days versus 28.5â days, Log-rank p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19. Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.

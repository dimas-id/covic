Aim This pilot study aimed to reveal whether combination of electrostimulation with iloprost treatment achieves better results compared to iloprost alone in patients with critical limb ischemia. Material and methods Patients were randomized into Group 1 ( n = 11, mean age: 65.3 ± 4.2 years, received iloprost infusion protocol alone) or Group 2 ( n = 11, mean age: 62.9 ± 6.7, received iloprost infusion plus standardized protocol of peroneal nerve electrostimulation). Electrostimulation was delivered with 1 Hz frequency, 27 mA current, and 200 ms pulse width. Peak blood flow velocities in the anterior and posterior tibialis arteries were measured with duplex ultrasound. Results There was a slight insignificant increase in blood velocity in anterior tibialis artery in Group 1 (from 17.6 ± 13.0 to 18.6 ± 13.1, p = 0.57), whereas the increase in Group 2 was marked (from 23.8 ± 18.3 to 32.2 ± 19.7, p = 0.01). Blood velocity in posterior tibialis artery also increased in both groups, but it was not of statistical significance. No significant difference was found between two groups in regard to final pulse oximetry oxygen saturation levels. Conclusion Electrostimulation of the peroneal nerve caused a substantial increase in anterior tibialis artery blood velocity when used as an adjunct to medical therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia.

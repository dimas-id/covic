We welcomed Professor Cook's article clarifying the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in protecting staff during the current COVID-19 pandemic [1]. There remains considerable debate about the extent to which airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. Small droplets (< 5µm) are thought to remain suspended in the air and could theoretically be inhaled into the lungs causing infection [2]. Loose fitting "surgical" masks will not prevent such inhalation and only a tight-fitting filtering mask is adequate. Conversely larger (> 5µm) particles do not remain suspended in the air [2] and can only cause infection if they are immediately inhaled, or after contact with a surface they land on.

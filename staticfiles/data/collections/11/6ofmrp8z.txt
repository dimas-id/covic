This study was performed to evaluate the feasibility of the splenic bed laparoscopic splenectomy approach (SBLS) for massive splenomegaly (≥30 cm) in patients with hypersplenism secondary to portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Patients who underwent laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) from January 2012 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. We performed LS in 83 patients with massive splenomegaly (≥30 cm) secondary to portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis. Of these patients, 37 underwent the SBLS and 46 underwent anterior LS (ALS). Five patients in the ALS group and none in the SBLS group underwent conversion to open surgery. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss volume, transfusion volume, frequency of transfusion, hemorrhage of short gastric vessels, conversion rate, postoperative hospital stay, and incidence of pancreatic fistula were all significantly lower in the SBLS than ALS group (all P < 0.05). No death or postoperative bleeding occurred in the two groups, and there were no significant differences in age, gender, spleen size, hemoglobin level, platelet count, prothrombin time, Child-Pugh class, hypoproteinemia, or ascites (all P > 0.05). The SBLS is more feasible and effective than ALS in patients with massive splenomegaly (≥30 cm) secondary to portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis.

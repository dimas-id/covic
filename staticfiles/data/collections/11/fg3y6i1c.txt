BACKGROUND The Society of Neurointerventional Surgery revised its operational definition of emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) recently to include proximal M2 segment middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions. We sought to assess the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) over best medical care for M2 segment MCA occlusion. METHODS Patient level data from trials in the HERMES Collaboration were included. The HERMES core laboratory identified patients with M2 segment MCA occlusions and further classified them as proximal versus distal, anterior versus posterior division, and dominant versus co-dominant versus non-dominant. Primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) rates at end of procedure, 90-day mRS shift, 90-day mRS 0-1, 24 hours National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0-2, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and death. RESULTS 130 patients with M2 MCA (proximal location n=116 vs distal n=14, anterior division n=72 vs posterior n=58, dominant n=73 vs co-dominant n=50 vs non-dominant n=7) were included. Successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b or 3) among those undergoing EVT was seen in 59.2% of patients. Treatment effect favored EVT (adjusted OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.28, p=0.03) for 90-day mRS 0-2 (58.2% EVT vs 39.7% control). Direction of benefit favored EVT for other outcomes. Treatment effect favoring EVT was maximal in patients with proximal M2 segment MCA occlusions (n=116, adjusted OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.13 to 6.37) and in dominant M2 segment MCA occlusions (n=73, adjusted OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.48). No sICH (0%) was observed in patients treated with EVT compared with five (7.9%) in the control arm. CONCLUSION Patients with proximal M2 segment MCA occlusions eligible for EVT trial protocols benefited from EVT.

INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has been shown to have many benefits for patients including shorter hospital stay and fewer operative complications. The traditional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication has been performed by the use of 5 incisions. With the inception of single incision procedures, surgeons have been examining other procedures that may benefit from adoption of an even less invasive technique. MATERIALS A 36-year-old female underwent a single incision laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication using 3 trocars. The patient's body mass index was 29 kg/m. RESULTS The operative time was 52 minutes. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications within the 30 days. The patient was discharged home on the first postoperative day on a full liquid diet. CONCLUSIONS Single incision laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is feasible with comparable outcomes with the traditional 5 incision laparoscopic technique.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world in unprecedented ways. It is clear that this pandemic, unlike any public health challenge in recent memory, has the potential to fundamentally alter the delivery of many healthcare services, including the practice of oral and maxillofacial surgery. In response to this global health crisis, the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) COVID-19 Response Conference was held virtually on April 9, 2020, organized by oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMSs) and administrators from multiple institutions to provide a forum for OMSs to discuss how COVID-19 has affected the specialty. As evidence-based information on COVID-19 continues to emerge, the present report serves as a method to disseminate the current opinions and management strategies from a variety of experts in OMS.

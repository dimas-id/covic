OBJECTIVE: To assess urology residency program modifications in the context of COVID-19, and perceptions of the impact on urology trainees. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of program leadership and residents at accredited US urology residencies was administered between April 28, 2020 to March 11, 2020. Total cohort responses are reported, and subanalyses were preformed comparing responses between those in in high vs low COVID-19 geographic regions, and between program leaders vs residents. RESULTS: Program leaders from 43% of programs and residents from 18% of programs responded. Respondents reported decreased surgical volume (83%-100% varying by subspecialty), increased use of telehealth (99%), a transition to virtual educational platforms (95%) and decreased size of inpatient resident teams (90%). Most residents are participating in care of COVID-19 patients (83%) and 20% endorsed that urology residents have been re-deployed. Seventy nine percent of respondents perceive a negative impact of recent events on urology surgery training and anxiety regarding competency upon completion of residency training was more pronounced among respondents in high COVID-19 regions. CONCLUSION: Major modifications to urology training programs were implemented in response to COVID-19. Attention must be paid to the downstream effects of the training disruption on urology residents.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the technique of laparoscopic kidney transplant and demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure by an extraperitoneal approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS The procedure was performed on 2 human cadavers. Retroperitoneal endoscopic left nephrectomy was performed. An extraperitoneal space was established by inflation of a balloon dilator. The external iliac artery and vein were exposed. A Pfannenstiel incision (6 cm) was made and a hand-access device was used. The renal artery was anastomosed to the external iliac artery (end-to-side anastomosis); the renal vein was anastomosed to the external iliac vein (end-to-side anastomosis). The ureter was anastomosed to the bladder with an extravesical tunnelling technique. RESULTS The donor kidney grafts were obtained successfully. The preparation of the external iliac artery and vein was satisfactory. The entire procedure for the renal artery, renal vein, and ureteral anastomoses was performed with laparoscopic technique without any difficulty. CONCLUSIONS The present model on human cadavers may provide a feasible approach for training surgeons to perform human laparoscopic kidney transplant. The present technique may be applied to clinical human kidney transplant.

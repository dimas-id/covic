Inspired by fusion-inhibitory peptides from heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domains from human immuno-deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp41 and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) based on viral fusogenic mechanism in the present work, we provided a similar approach to design the synthesized peptides against the entry into host cells of SARA-CoV-2 virus that causes 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). These peptides derived from HR1 and HR2 of SARA-CoV-2 spike protein were further tested for their interaction and potential fusion possibility through circular dichroism spectrum. Here we used the peptide COVID-2019-HR1P1 (40 amino acids) as the target, which was derived from HR1 of SARA-CoV-2 spike protein, while the designed peptides including COVID-2019-HR2P1 (37 amino acids), COVID-2019-HR2P2 (32 amino acids) and others derived from HR2 of SARA-CoV-2 were tested for their binding to COVID-2019-HR1P1. Interestingly, results showed that both COVID-2019-HR2P1 and COVID-2019-HR2P2 can form the complex with COVID-2019-HR1P1, respectively. This implied that these designed peptides could play an important role in blocking SARA-CoV-2 entry into mammalian host cells via viral fusogenic mechanism, and thus could be used for preventing SARA-CoV-2 infection.

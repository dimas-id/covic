Species A rotaviruses (RVAs) are a leading cause of diarrhea in children and in the young of a large variety of mammalian and avian host species. The purpose of this study was to identify RVA in nomadic goats and calves during severe diarrhea outbreaks in 2012 and 2014 in Bouaarfa, Morocco, and to characterize the complete genomic constellation of two bovine and caprine strains (S18 and S19) and their genetic relatedness with the human strain ma31 detected in 2011 in Morocco. Partial nucleotide sequencing of VP4 and VP7 genes for the twenty-two positive samples revealed three circulating genotypes: G6P[14], G10P[14], and G10P[5] with predominance of G6P[14] genotype. Full-genome sequencing for both strains S18 and S19 presented, respectively, the following genomic constellations: G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 and G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3. Phylogenetic analyses and the analysis of the VP8* antigenic epitopes for S18, S19 and ma31 revealed a shared similarity with bovine, caprine, ovine and human strains from Morocco and other countries. The VP2 and NSP1 genes of the S19 strain were closely related to those of the cognate genes of the human ma31 strain, while the VP4 gene of S18 strain was closely related to the cogent gene of the ma31 strain. Our findings revealed cases of zoonotic transmission and confirmed the risk of emergence of new genotypes in some environments such as nomadic regions, where close physical proximity between human and livestock is common. The present study is novel in reporting whole-genome analyses of RVA isolates obtained from nomadic livestock in Morocco.

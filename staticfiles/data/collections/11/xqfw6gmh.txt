Summary This paper presents estimates of the value of statistical life (VSL) in rural Thailand using the contingent-valuation (CV) method. These estimates are applied to an economic analysis of landmine clearance. The estimated VSL of US$250000 suggests that the value of lives saved from landmine clearance is at least an order of magnitude greater than the values used in existing studies.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, an optimal management of vulnerable patients, such as pregnant women, has been regarded as a challenge for healthcare professionals. Although thrombocytopaenia is considered a minor criterion for admission within an intensive care unit, a low platelet count has been observed in COVID-19 patients, including a pregnant woman, who developed severe pulmonary complications. Furthermore, thrombocytopaenia has been proposed as a potential biomarker in order to identify cases at high-risk complications. Nevertheless, thrombocytopaenia is a relatively frequent condition observed in pregnancy. In this context, a differential diagnosis is essential for the correct management of COVID-19 pregnant women.

This chapter provides an overview of the classification and description of the canine coronavirus, its hosts, the key developments regarding the virus, and the diagnostic techniques and reagents. Canine coronavirus causes diarrhea and vomiting in dogs. The hosts that are infected by the canine coronavirus include dogs and coyotes. It is a recognized disease of dogs. Although the virus was first isolated in 1971, the disease entity was reported in 1974. The experimental pathogenesis has been described. Immune electron microscopy (EM) may aid the diagnosis but as transmissible gastro-enteritis (TGE) virus may also react, viral isolation may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. The diagnostic reagents include routine EM materials and virus isolation in A72 cells.

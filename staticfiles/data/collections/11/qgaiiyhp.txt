INTRODUCTION A robotic laparoendoscopic single-site access surgery (R-LESS) platform that incorporates the EndoWrist function of robotic instruments may provide better triangulation and retraction during LESS. The aim of the study is to assess if R-LESS is feasible with standard robotic instruments via a single incision and whether the approach could reduce the difficulty of the procedure and confer additional benefits over conventional LESS. METHODS This was a prospective randomized controlled study investigating the workload performance, efficacy, and risks of performing R-LESS when compared with human LESS (H-LESS) in a survival porcine model for cholecystectomy and gastrojejunostomy. The primary outcome is the NASA task load index. Secondary outcomes included the difficulty of the procedures, procedural time, morbidities, and mortalities. RESULTS Twenty-four cholecystectomies and gastrojejunostomies using the R-LESS or H-LESS approach (12:12) were performed. None of the swine suffered from procedural adverse events and none of the procedures required conversion. In both the cholecystectomy and gastrojejunostomy groups, R-LESS was associated with significantly lower NASA task load index (P < 0.001) and reduced difficulties in various steps of the procedures. No differences in the overall procedure times of the two procedures were observed (P = 0.315). CONCLUSION The R-LESS approach significantly reduced the workload and difficulties of LESS cholecystectomies and gastrojejunostomies. A dedicated single-site platform that could reduce instrument clashing while retaining the EndoWrist function is eagerly awaited.

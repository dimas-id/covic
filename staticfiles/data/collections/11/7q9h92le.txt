Foot‐and‐mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven‐hoof animals including cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and lots of wild species. Effectively control measures are urged needed. Here, we showed that homoharringtonine treatment exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against two different strains of FMDVs (O/MYA98/BY/2010 and A/GD/MM/2013) in swine kidney (IBRS‐2) cells. Further experiments demonstrated that homoharringtonine did not affect virus attachment or entry. Using time‐of‐addition assays, we found that the antiviral activity of homoharringtonine occurred primarily during the early stage of infection. These results demonstrated that homoharringtonine might be an effective anti‐FMDV drug. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral activity of homoharringtonine against FMDV replication in vivo.

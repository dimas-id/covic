PURPOSE Ergogenic effect in physically active subjects has been reported after acute salbutamol (SAL) intake. β2-Agonists have potential stimulant effects within the central nervous system that could be involved in this ergogenic effect. We hypothesized that acute SAL intake would induce changes in cerebral responses during exercise, with significant improvement in cerebral oxygenation and voluntary activation (VA) contributing to an increase in muscle performance. METHODS Fourteen trained male subjects (25 ± 5 yr) performed repeated isometric knee extensions until task failure (TF) after 4 mg (oral) SAL, 800 μg (inhaled) SAL, or placebo intake. VA, corticospinal excitability, and inhibition assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation and changes in hemoglobin concentrations assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy were measured before and during the fatiguing task. RESULTS SAL had no significant effect both at rest and during exercise on prefrontal cortex oxygenation (e.g., changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration at TF: 11.4 ± 11.1 (4 mg SAL) vs 10.4 ± 10.6 (800 μg SAL) vs 10.8 ± 8.1 μmol (placebo); P = 0.314) and neuromuscular function (e.g., VA measured by TMS at TF: 90.2% ± 6.6% vs 92.6% ± 5.0% vs 90.1% ± 7.0%; P = 0.760). SAL had no effect on the number of contractions until TF (95 ± 51 vs 100 ± 52 vs 93 ± 47; P = 0.629). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that acute SAL intake had no effect on central and peripheral mechanisms of neuromuscular fatigue and did not improve quadriceps endurance.

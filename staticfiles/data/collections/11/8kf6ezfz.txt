Asbestos-containing roofing products were widely used throughout the 20th century, and certain products are still used in limited quantities today. Roofing products are generally considered non-friable and are not expected to release appreciable amounts of airborne asbestos fibers; however, despite the variety of roofing products that have contained asbestos over time, there are no comprehensive analyses of the exposure data associated with these products in the published literature. The objective of this study was to analyze the available data and characterize asbestos exposures associated with the installation, removal, and replacement of built-up roofing (BUR), felts, flashings, shingles, coatings, cements, and mastics under a variety of work practices. Published and unpublished literature that contained the following information was included in the analysis: (1) airborne fiber concentrations determined by PCM; (2) a description of the product(s) used; and (3) a description of the task(s) performed. More than 800 personal air samples from 12 studies performed between 1982 and 2010 were identified which fit the inclusion criteria. The findings indicate that short-term and full-shift exposures from the use of asbestos-containing roofing products were typically well below applicable occupational exposure limits. Additionally, the cumulative exposures associated with roofing work would be well below published chrysotile no-observed-adverse-effect-levels (NOAELs) for asbestos-related diseases.

INTRODUCTION The ENDOSTROKE registry aims to accompany the spreading use of endovascular stroke treatment (EVT) in academic and non-academic hospitals. This analysis focuses on preprocedural imaging, patient handling and referral, as well as on different treatment modalities in mechanical recanalization. METHODS Data for this study were from observational registry study in 12 stroke centers in Germany and Austria with online assessment of prespecified variables concerning endovascular stroke therapy. RESULTS Data from 734 patients undergoing EVT were analyzed. Preferred imaging modality prior to EVT was CT (83 %) and CTA (78 %). In 95 %, EVT was performed under general anesthesia. In 55 % of patients, a combination of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis and EVT was used, followed by pure EVT (25 %), intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis plus EVT (13 %) and IV + IA thrombolysis plus EVT (7 %). Intrahospital time delay until start of EVT was 91 and 99 min in anterior and vertebrobasilar circulation stroke, respectively. Average duration of EVT was 60 min. Overall thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 2/3 recanalization rate was 85 %. Stent retrievers were used in 75 %, being associated with higher recanalization rates than non-stent retrievers. Hemorrhagic complications (symptomatic and asymptomatic) occurred in 12 %. Overall vessel occlusion time was approximately 60 min longer in patients being referred from a primary care hospital for EVT. CONCLUSION This study gives an overview of procedure-related factors in current EVT practice. It gives estimates on preprocedural imaging modalities, periprocedural handling, and treatment combinations used for EVT. Patient referral for EVT from primary care hospitals is associated with longer vessel occlusion times.

Abstract Campylobacter rectus is a member of the human oral flora and is associated with periodontal disease. We report the first case of severe acute otitis media (AOM) due to C. rectus in a previous healthy 15-year-old boy, which was confirmed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. C. rectus is a possible causative pathogen of AOM.

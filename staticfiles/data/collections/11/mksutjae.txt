Prevention of infectious diseases is targeted at individuals, specific risk groups or communities. Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective medical interventions and protect the individual and the community against vaccine preventable diseases. Immunization programs aim to control, eliminate or eradicate infectious pathogens. In industrialized countries several vaccine preventable diseases are almost eliminated. Strict implementation of recommendations for influenza and pneumococcal immunization is crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality. Hence, uptake of recommended immunization among adults and elderly people is often low. Internal specialists are demanded to improve vaccine coverage in those age groups.

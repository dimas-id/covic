In the context of the joint project INSELpro funded by BMBF, prosumers offer their services on a market of local neighbourhood services. Citizens in need of help in the local geographic sector are placed with suitable helpers for their respective support requirements via the service platform, who have basically agreed to provide assistance. Demand and supply are mediated via a sharing platform, but final agreements as well services are provided offline. The special feature here is that the selection of those willing to help the inquirers is limited based on a matrix of required and existing skills, which will improve the quality of the placement. The research project is based on the scientific approach of prototyping, in which an artifact (here: the mediation platform with an app as front-end) is developed in several iterative cycles. User-centered evaluations are directly linked to the individual development steps to be able to directly counteract any undesirable developments. Various measures are conceivable to expand participation in this electronically supported and coordinated form of neighbourhood assistance or to maintain it at a high level. This paper describes approaches to incentivising the prosumers involved, which can be carried out both online and offline.

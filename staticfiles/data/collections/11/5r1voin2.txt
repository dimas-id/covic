INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly around the world and caused more than 487 000 infections and 22 000 deaths worldwide. METHODS: We report two infant cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Yichang, Hubei, China. The younger of the two is only 5-months old. We recorded their clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, laboratory examination, and treatment in detail. In addition, we provide computed tomographic images of their chest, which are the most serious imaging manifestation among the infants recorded so far. RESULTS: Although both of them eventually recovered and were discharged from the hospital, they were complicated with varying degrees of liver and myocardial injury. In addition, one of them was complicated with mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians should consider the potential risks of developing severe illness of infants infected by SARS-CoV-2 and take them seriously.

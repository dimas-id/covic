Transcription of the subgenomic mRNA of Sindbis virus (SINV) is initiated at a subgenomic promoter (SP). Alignment of SINV sequences identified a 68-nucleotide conserved domain spanning −19 to +49 relative to the subgenomic mRNA start site. Nucleotide T or C is present at −18 or +49 in all known SINVs while a Sindbis-like virus XJ-160 has an A or T at a corresponding position. Our results indicate that deletion or substitution of the T at +49 decreased the activity of SP, while substituting T for A at −18 did not decrease the activity of SP or genetic stability of recombinant SINV.

The meaning of the term ‘inflammation’ has undergone considerable evolution. It was originally defined around the year 25 A.D. by Aulus Cornelius Celsus [1] and described the body’s acute reaction following a traumatic event, such as a microscopic tear of a ligament or muscle. His original wording: “Notae vero inflammationis sunt quatour: rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore” (true signs of inflammation are four: redness and swelling with heat and pain) still holds. Disturbance of function (functio laesa) is the legendary fifth cardinal sign of inflammation and was added by Galen in the second century A.D. [2]. Recent articles [3] highlight the complicated role that inflammation plays in chronic illnesses, including metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to these difficult-to-treat diseases, more research and research tools are needed to illuminate therapeutic strategies in another difficulty-to-treat inflammatory malady, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

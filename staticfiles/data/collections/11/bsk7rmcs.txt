OBJECTIVE: Family caregivers of people with dementia perform duties that are important for maintaining their loved one's overall well-being. However, it is not yet clear how these caregivers' quality-of-life affects their ability to meet the care demands of their loved ones. The purpose of this study is to utilize a mixed methods approach in investigating how family caregiver quality-of-life affects the care provided to people with dementia. Family caregivers will be recruited from the Rochester, New York area to participate in focus groups or one-on-one interviews. In addition to the qualitative data obtained, caregivers will complete questionnaires regarding their own quality-of-life (e.g., health status, socioeconomic) as well as the care provided to their loved ones with dementia (e.g., how the care provided meets the needs of the care recipient, time spent). A convergent mixed methods approach will be used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data obtained. RESULTS: Data from the interviews will be transcribed verbatim and then analyzed qualitatively. Quantitative data from the questionnaires will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software. A convergent mixed methods approach will be applied to the datasets to help shed light on the relationship between family caregiver quality-of-life and the care provided to people living with dementia. Understanding of this relationship will make it possible to develop initiatives that better address caregiver needs.

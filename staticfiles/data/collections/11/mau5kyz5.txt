Abstract In the last decade, the control of avian influenza virus has experienced many difficulties, which have caused major global agricultural problems that have also led to public health consequences. Conventional biochemical methods are not sufficient to detect and control agricultural pathogens in the field due to the growing demand for food and subsidiary products; thus, studies aiming to develop potent alternatives to conventional biochemical methods are urgently needed. In this review, emerging detection systems, their applicability to diagnostics, and their therapeutic possibilities in view of nanotechnology are discussed. Nanotechnology-based sensors are used for rapid, sensitive and cost-effective diagnostics of agricultural pathogens. The application of different nanomaterials promotes interactions between these materials and the virus, which enables researchers to construct portable electroanalytical biosensing analyser that should effectively detect the influenza virus. The present review will provide insights into the guidelines for future experiments to develop better techniques to detect and control influenza viruses.

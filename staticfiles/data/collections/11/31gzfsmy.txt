The Indian Armed Forces have always responded to the Nation's call and the COVID-19 pandemic response has been no different. On instructions from the Government of India, the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) pitched in right from the initial stages of the epidemic in India as part of a coordinated national response. Be it the execution of medical quarantine for Indian citizens evacuated from China and other COVID affected countries or establishing dedicated and mixed COVID hospitals for its own clientele as well as civilian patients, the AFMS worked in tandem with the national policies. The Armed Forces ensured force preservation and protection of its own troops and families by timely implementation of public health measures, even as it played its designated role in the national strategy. With vision, understanding and clarity, the AFMS continue to lend shoulder to India's response to this global public health challenge.

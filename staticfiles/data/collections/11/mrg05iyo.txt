PURPOSE To investigate mesh-related complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair using DynaMesh®. METHODS In the period 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2010, 181 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair in our day surgery unit using DynaMesh® were entered prospectively in the National Danish Hernia Database. Data concerning abdominal reoperations after hernia repair were later collected on all 181 patients from the National Danish Health Registry. Postoperative telephone interviews were conducted estimating postoperative pain and patient satisfaction. RESULTS Six % (11 patients) were reoperated because of mesh-related complications. Three had small bowel obstruction and one had a colonic fistula with mesh infection, all causing bowel resection and mesh removal. Mesh-related cutaneous fistula was seen in one patient. Six patients had a symptomatic recurrence requiring reoperation. Abdominal wall hematomas were seen in two cases, while two other patients had symptomatic large seromas, of which one was drained surgically. After a median follow-up of 34 months (range 12-63) in 140 patients, 66 % were pain free (0 on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)). Of 26 patients with moderate to severe pain (NRS > 3) at follow-up, only 4 regretted the operation. Sixteen patients thought they had a recurrence, of these only 3 regretted the operation. CONCLUSION The use of DynaMesh® in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair was associated with a 6 % risk of mesh-related reoperation in a high volume setting. Despite chronic pain in 19 %, after 34 months follow-up patient satisfaction was high.

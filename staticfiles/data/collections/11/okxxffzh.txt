Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyeli‐nating disease of the central nervous system. The hallmark of its pathology is the demyelinated plaque with reactive glial scar formation. However, a detailed analysis of the patterns of demyelination, oligodendroglia cell pathology and the reaction of other tissue components suggests that the pathogenesis of myelin destruction in this disease may be heterogeneous. In this review we present a new classification scheme of lesional activity on the basis of the molecular composition of myelin degradation products in macrophages. When these criteria are used, different patterns of demyelination can be distinguished, including demyelination with relative preservation of oligodendrocytes, myelin destruction with concomitant and complete destruction of oligodendrocytes or primary destruction or disturbance of myelinating cells with secondary demyelination. Furthermore, in some cases a primary selective demyelination may be followed by secondary oligodendrocyte loss in the established lesions. Finally, some extraordinarily severe conditions may result in destructive lesions with loss of myelin, oligodendrocytes, axons and astro‐cytes. This heterogeneity of plaque pathology is discussed in the context of recent experimental models of inflammatory demyelination, which show that different immunological pathways may lead to the formation of demyelinated plaques that reveal the diverse structural aspects described above. Our data indicate, that the demyelinated plaques of multiple sclerosis may reflect a common pathological end point of a variety of different immunological mechanisms of myelin destruction in this disease.

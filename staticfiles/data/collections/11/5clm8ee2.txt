BACKGROUND/AIMS Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has two serious problems; its feasibility and cost. We report our experience and benefits of our original SILC procedure using homemade trocars that can solve those problems. METHODOLOGY SILC was attempted for thirty-four patients at our hospital. The SILST" Port (Covidien, Inc) was used in 16 patients (SPgroup) and the original method using a surgical glove port with homemade trocars was performed in 18 patients (GP-HT group). A homemade trocar was made ofa 2.5mL and a 5mL syringe. We performed the retrospective comparison of the operative and postoperative results between those two groups. RESULTS Thirty patients (14 in the SP group and 16 in the GP-HT group)successfully underwent SILC. No patient had a grade IIor more severe postoperative complication based on the Clavien-Dindo classification. Our original home made trocar was slim and compact enough to avoid clashes among surgical instruments and surgeon's hands. Operative time in the GP-HT group was significantly short-er than that in the SP group (p=0.0044). CONCLUSIONS Although further prospective studies of larger series should be performed, this simple and cost-effective system can be one of the promising ways for SILC.

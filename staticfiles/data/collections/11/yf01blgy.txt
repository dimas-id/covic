Abstract Because nanoparticles have superior surface activity and can be applied to the production of particles with various functions, they are extremely important for the future development of sophisticated material technologies. On the other hand, this superior activity of nanoparticles is a cause of trouble from the perspective of safety and does not always have a positive influence on the environment. Attention must also be paid to impact on health. Nevertheless, all technologies have negative aspects, and overcoming these kinds of problems, we will be able to utilize the superior characteristics of nanoparticles for practical purposes. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to fully understand the influence of nanoparticles on the environment and the relevant safety issues.

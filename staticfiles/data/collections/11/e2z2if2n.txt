As surgical innovation and technological advancements evolve, the associated costs cannot be overlooked. Currently, the United States health care system is undergoing an attempted overhaul with technology such as robotics sitting front and center of the financial debate. As patient demand for less invasive surgical options increases and standards of practice change, patient outcomes must be carefully evaluated to justify the costs increase from traditional, often more invasive treatments. The collection of financial data is quite varied among hospital systems and so is the models used to determine the costs of robotics. Although limited thus far, various cost data have been ascertained in the areas of reproductive surgery, hysterectomy (both benign and oncologic), and pelvic reconstructive surgery.

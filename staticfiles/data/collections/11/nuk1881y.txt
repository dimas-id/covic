Community acquired co-infection in COVID-19 is not well defined. Current literature describes co-infection in 0-40% of COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective report, co-infection was identified in 3.7% of patients and 41% of patients admitted to intensive care (p<0.005). Despite infrequent co-infection, antibiotics were used in 69% of patients.

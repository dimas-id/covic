OBJECTIVES Today, thoracic surgeons have many possible pathways to advance their training in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). For uniportal VATS (uVATS) in particular, what are the training options available and does regulating training matter? METHODS The relevant literature pertaining to uVATS training is reviewed. RESULTS Current options for surgeons looking to train in uVATS range from videos on the internet, through 'experts' demonstrating live surgery, to symposia and hands-on wet labs being held in all regions of the world. All have merits, and the aspiring VATS surgeon can choose from a range of preceptorship and proctorship modules to suit his/her own training needs. However, issues in the formalizing training in uVATS remains unresolved. Is there an ideal pathway through uVATS training? At what point can a trainee be considered to have 'graduated' to become an expert in uVATS? Who indeed trains the trainer, and certifies the competence of a training centre? CONCLUSIONS Although a plethora of training options exist, formulation of a robust training curriculum can further bolster the status of uVATS as a sustainable surgical approach that can be delivered with consistent quality.

Influenza is a viral zoonosis of birds and mammals that has probably existed since antiquity. Attack rates of influenza are relatively high but mortality is relatively low. Influenza mortality is highest in the very young, the very old, and the immunosuppressed. Influenza has the potential for rapid spread and may involve large populations. This article examines the swine influenza (H1N1) strain of recent origin, and compares the microbiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, differential, clinical, and laboratory diagnosis, therapy, complications, and prognosis with previous recorded outbreaks of avian and human seasonal influenza pneumonias.

BACKGROUND The major factor affecting morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation (LTX) is bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Earlier studies have suggested a connection between the presence of viral agents and morbidity in this patient group, but data are somewhat conflicting. The objective of this study was to investigate the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and graft loss after LTX in relation to the presence of respiratory viruses during the first year after LTX. METHOD The study is a retrospective cohort study of 39 LTX recipients 11Y13 years after surgery. Patients were operated between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The presence of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from patients during the first year after surgery was analyzed retrospectively using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction test capable of detecting 15 respiratory agents. The time to BOS or graft loss was analyzed in relation to the positive findings in BAL during the first year after LTX. RESULTS Patients with one or more viruses detected in BAL during the first year after transplantation demonstrated a significantly faster development of BOS (P=0.005) compared with patients with no virus detected. No significant difference in graft survival was found. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the long-term prognosis after LTX may be negatively affected by viral respiratory tract infections during the first year after LTX.

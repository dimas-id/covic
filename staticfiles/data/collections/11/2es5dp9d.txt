Abstract Myocarditis is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening disease. Clinical manifestations could range from subclinical disease to sudden death, due to fulminant heart failure and/or malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The most common cause of myocarditis is viral infection, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Nevertheless, EBV rarely presents with cardiac involvement in immunocompetent hosts. We report a case of acute EBV-related myocarditis in a young female, complicated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. After 20 days of hospitalization and treatment, the patient was fit for discharge on pharmacological therapy (tapering steroids, beta-blockers, amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics). Clinical course is described, cardiac magnetic resonance images are shown. This case underlines how myocarditis is a disease that should not be underestimated: it could present with life-threatening complications such as malignant arrhythmias and/or severe systolic dysfunction. <Learning objective: Although Epstein-Barr virus rarely presents with cardiac involvement in immunocompetent hosts, the risk should not be underestimated, as it could present with life-threatening complications.>

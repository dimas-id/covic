Since its invention nearly 20 years ago, the Covidien LigaSure device along with its ForceTriad generator has dominated the Electrothermal Bipolar Vessel Sealing market. The LigaSure was used for surgical procedures, both open and laparoscopic. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence of the safety and utility of the LigaSure device compared to more traditional means of hemostasis and its ultrasonic competitor, particularly in laparoscopic applications. We will provide evidence related to electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing in general and look specifically at Covidien's newest product, the LigaSure Maryland Jaw Device.

Face masks wearing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic became ubiquitous. The aim of our study was to assess the use of face masks among young adults during the current viral pandemic. The survey was based on specially created Google Forms and posted on numerous Facebook groups for young people in Poland. Seven days were considered as a recall period. A total of 2315 answers were obtained, 2307 were finally analysis, as eight questionnaires were removed because of data incompleteness. 60.4% of responders declared using the face masks. Those who reported an atopic predisposition wore face masks significantly (P = .007) more commonly (65.5% and 57.7%, respectively). Cloth masks (46.2%) appeared to be most popular ones, followed by surgical masks (39.2%), respirators (N95 and FFP) (13.3%), half‐face elastomeric respirators (0.8%) and full‐face respirators (0.4%). Females significantly more frequently (P = .0001) used cloth masks; respirators, half‐face elastomeric respirators and full‐face respirators were used more commonly by males (P < .0001, P = .001 and P = .001, respectively). 23.9% of responders who used single‐use mask wore it again. Moreover, 73.6% participants declared mask decontamination; however, the procedures were not always appropriate. We suggest that our results may be of help in construction of general public education campaigns on the proper use of face masks.

Network analysis is a powerful tool that provides us a fruitful framework to describe phenomena related to social, technological, and many other real-world complex systems. In this paper, we present a brief review about complex networks including fundamental quantities, examples of network models, and the essential role of network topology in the investigation of dynamical processes as epidemics, rumor spreading, and synchronization. A quite of advances have been provided in this field, and many other authors also review the main contributions in this area over the years. However, we show an overview from a different perspective. Our aim is to provide basic information to a broad audience and more detailed references for those who would like to learn deeper the topic.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global pandemic but the follow-up data of discharged patients was barely described. AIMS: To investigate clinical outcomes, distribution of quarantine locations, and the infection status of the contacts of COVID-19 patients after discharge. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study METHODS: Demographics, baseline characteristics of 131 COVID-19 patients discharged from February 3 to 21, 2020 in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed by reviewing the medical records retrospectively. Post-hospitalization data related to clinical outcomes, quarantine locations and close contact history were obtained by following up the patients every week up to 4 weeks. RESULTS: 53 (40.05%) patients on discharge had cough (29.01%), fatigue (7.63%), expectoration (6.11%), chest tightness (6.11%), dyspnea (3.82%), chest pain (3.05%), and palpitation (1.53%). These symptoms constantly declined in 4 weeks post discharge. Transient fever recurred in 11 (8.4%) patients. 78 (59.5%) discharged patients underwent chest CT and 2 (1.53%) showed deterioration. 94 (71.8%) patients received SARS-CoV-2 retest and 8 (6.10%) reported positive. 7 (2.29%) patients were re-admitted because of fever or positive SARS-CoV-2 retest. 121 (92.37%) and 4 (3.05%) patients were self-quarantined at home or community spots following discharge, with totally 167 closely contacted persons free of COVID-19 at the endpoint of study. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 patients after discharge were in the course of recovery. Readmission was required in rare cases due to suspected recurrence of COVID-19. Although no contacted infection observed, appropriate self-quarantine and regular reexamination are necessary, particularly for those who have recurred symptoms.

Occlusion balloon catheters of 5.2- or 6-French have been used for a few decades in various endovascular treatments of body trunk vascular lesions. However, these catheters may be difficult to place in cases of excessive vessel tortuosity, small vessels, and anatomic complexity. Recently, the introduction of the double lumen microballoon catheters for body trunk vascular lesions has allowed operators to advance them into more distal, smaller, and more tortuous vessels. Since the launch of the first generation microballoon catheters onto the market in Japan in 2011, the microballoon catheters have evolved and are now generally available for clinical use. The purpose of this article is to review the evolution and current clinical applications of the microballoon catheters in the field of interventional radiology.

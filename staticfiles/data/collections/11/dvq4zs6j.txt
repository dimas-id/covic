This Journal conference was the first to be held with a live audience. After the final faculty presentation, and in lieu of a conference summary from the guest editors, the conference faculty had a discussion session that addressed written questions from the audience. The moderators, Lewis Rubinson and Rich Branson, reviewed the questions and addressed them either to specific conference faculty or to the entire conference faculty group. There were too many questions to address in the allotted time, so the moderators selected the questions they thought either most pertinent or most likely to be answerable.

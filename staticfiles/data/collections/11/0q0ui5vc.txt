AIM The iMESH Tacker™ (IMT) device is a device which simplifies laproscopic hernia repair by enabling an articulation of the device tip. The study compares the strength of mesh fixation between the IMT and another commercial tack (ACT) device - Absorbatack™ (Covidien, Corp, Mansfield, MA, USA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Strips of mesh were installed on the abodminal wall of three pigs. Half of the meshes were fixated by IMT and half by ACT. Euthanasia was done immediately to the first pig, after14 days to the second and after 27 days to the third pig. The mesh strips were pulled while fixation force was measured. Statistical analysis was done using the two tailed t-test. All mesh strips were found to be fixated. Through detachment force test, the average force in the first pig was 17.1N ± 1.9 and 16.5N ± 8.3 (IMT and ACT respectively, n/s). The average force in the second pig was 18.8N ± 7.3 and 8.4N ± 4.1 (IMT and ACT respectively, p < 0.05). The average force in the third pig was 16.3N ± 5.3 and 10.9N ± 5.9 (IMT and ACT respectively, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The use of IMT is both feasible and easy to learn. The study showed that IMT creates average fixation force which is higher than ACT.

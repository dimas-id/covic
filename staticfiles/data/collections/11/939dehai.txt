OBJECTIVE To survey the dose of glucocorticosteroids administered in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and assess the effect of glucocorticosteroid doses in improving the patients' lung function. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted among 225 SARS patients treated in our in 2003. Oxygenation index was used as the effectness index, and the criteria for effectiveness was defiend as increase of the value of OI by 20% or above. RESULTS Glococoticostecoids were used in 59.56% of the SARS cases. The average value of OI before intravenous use of glucocorticosteroids was 237.08 mmHg, and that after the administration was 335.08 mmHg. The glucocorticosteroid doses that produce better effects were 1-3 mg/kg and 160-240 mg daily, with the total accumulative dose of 1000-2000 mg. The optimal duration of glucocorticosteroid use was 8-14 days. CONCLUSIONS For SARS treatment, Glucocorticosteroids can effectively ameliorate the SARS patients' lung symptoms and improve the lung function. The appropriate daily dose of glucocorticosteroids is 1-3 mg/kg or 160-240 mg/d for a duration of 8-14 d; the accumulative dose should be controlled around 1500 mg.

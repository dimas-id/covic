Abstract With 393 million guns, the USA concentrated nearly half of the worldwide firearms, with more guns than US citizens. In late 2019, a new highly contagious virus appeared in China, and spread around the world, with a high lethality rate. Initially named coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), the virus was renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov-19) which contributed to the increase of fear. Stress and anxiety caused the irrational necessity for self-defense and purchase of guns. Purchases of guns increased by one million in March 2020, and sales may probably explode in April. Victims of gun violence mobilize intensive care unit resources, that are vital in the context of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic with a shortage of assisted ventilation.

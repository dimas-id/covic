Innominate artery injury is a rare, but catastrophic complication of tracheostomy. We present a case of severe hemorrhagic shock in a 79-year-old male with innominate artery injury that occurred during tracheostomy. Despite temporary innominate artery isolation, the regional forehead saturation was 60 % without laterality. Because adequate cerebral blood flow was apparently maintained through collateral flow, we ligated the innominate, right carotid, and subclavian arteries. We confirmed adequate blood flow to the brain and the right subclavian artery through collateral circulation after ligation using computed tomographic angiography. A damage control management, which involves ligating the injured innominate artery to arrest hemorrhage and monitoring regional forehead saturation for brain ischemia, can be a considerable procedure for the treatment of severe hemorrhagic shock due to innominate artery injury.

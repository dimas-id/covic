We report the case of a 30-year-old body builder who developed a gluteal abscess at the site of injection of regularly self-administered anabolic steroids. After breaking the abscess under general anaesthesia, the patient developed septic shock and fulminant adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In addition to discussing the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, and treatment, we focus on the immunomodulatory mechanisms of anabolic substances that may have contributed to the course of the disease in this particular patient.

Despite a long history of success with laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy, the majority of hysterectomies in the United States are currently performed via laparotomy.48–51 Barriers to the integration of laparoscopic hysterectomy include technological difficulties, inadequate training, low levels of peer support, potential for decreased reimbursement and misconceptions about laparoscopic safety, cost, and technical feasibility.52–54 With the continual evolution of minimally invasive hysterectomy techniques, now including robotic, single-port, and natural-orifice surgery, it is vital to critically evaluate the literature in an effort to offer patients the most safe and effective treatments. This report aims to summarize the available data surrounding both the total and supracervical laparoscopic hysterectomy and to provide concrete suggestions for maximizing success with these procedures.

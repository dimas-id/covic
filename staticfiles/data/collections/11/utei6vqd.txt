Infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality in hematology patients especially those having undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The management relies on early diagnosis and rapid introduction of appropriate antimicrobial drugs frequently before the infectious agent has been identified. The use of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs has reduced the mortality in febrile neutropenia. However, the increase of multiresistant strains has in several countries become a major threat, and the development of new antibacterial drugs is urgently needed. Infection control strategies are also very important to limit the spread of multiresistant bacteria. Early diagnosis with imaging and tests for antigen or DNA is important for the management of fungal infections. High-risk patients should also receive prophylaxis. Viral infections are important causes of severe disease in patients having undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation but do occur also in non-transplanted patients. Early diagnosis usually with tests for viral nucleic acids is the key for appropriate management. Prevention and treatment with antiviral drugs are available for some viruses especially herpesviruses.

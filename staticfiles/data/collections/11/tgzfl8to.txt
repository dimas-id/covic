Recently in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Harzallah and colleagues report the results of antiphospholipid antibody testing in a series of 56 patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.[1] Twenty-five patients were found to be positive for lupus anticoagulants, while five patients had either anticardiolipin or anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. The isotypes for the anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies were reportedly IgG and IgM, although specific antibody titers and details of which were found in combination with a lupus anticoagulant in three overlap patients were not reported.

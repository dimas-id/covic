Abstract In an effort to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic and preserve essential healthcare resources, starting in mid-March 2020, surgeons have been instructed to only perform essential surgical procedures during this time. The vast majority of hip and knee arthroplasty surgery does not meet the definition of essential surgery. This study estimated the number of arthroplasty procedures that would be canceled due to these important restrictions. We estimated that approximately 30,000 primary and 3,000 revision hip and knee arthroplasty procedures will be canceled each week while COVID-19 restrictions regarding non-essential surgery are in place. This large number of canceled procedures will undoubtedly have a profound impact on patients and the healthcare system.

Between 2 and 10 years of age, the developing craniofacial skeleton poses a significant reconstructive challenge. Local autogenous bone is largely unavailable, distant bone grafts are fraught with significant morbidity and limited yield, and alloplastic materials are incompatible with the growing calvarium and facial skeleton. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, a member of a class of proteins first noticed in the 1960s to promote bone deposition in soft tissues, offers a potential solution to the bone shortage historically faced by the pediatric craniofacial surgeon. A review of English language literature was conducted from the 1960s to the present.Attention was focused on BMP-2's osteoinductive mechanism, basic science and translational laboratory findings, and multidisciplinary clinical experiences. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 has been embraced by spine surgeons, is gaining in popularity for long-bone repair, and is making its way into the plastic surgery literature. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 may provide a basis for an off-the-shelf tissue-engineered bone construct that is compatible with the growing craniofacial skeleton while free from the morbidities of distant graft harvest. Questions remain, however, regarding the safety and efficacy of this compound in the context of pediatric craniofacial surgery. In an effort to facilitate the clinician's risk-benefit analysis of this emerging technology, we present a primer on the basic science of BMP-2, a discussion of possible morbidities associated with its use, a review of laboratory and clinical trials with this substance to date, and an analysis of strategies to maximize its efficacy in craniofacial surgery.

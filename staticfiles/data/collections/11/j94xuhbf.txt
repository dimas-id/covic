INTRODUCTION Two-dimensional laparoscopy for living donor nephrectomy is the current standard of care. We report the first case of three-dimensional laparoscopy for living-donor nephrectomy with vaginal extraction. PRESENTATION OF CASE The procedure was performed in a 66-year-old woman donating his left kidney to her son with the HD S 3D column (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). Preoperative computed tomography showed one left renal artery. The warm ischemic time was 2min 20s and the operative time was 200min. There was no loss of blood and no intraoperative or postoperative complications. DISCUSSION This report demonstrates the feasibility of using 3D laparoscopy which allows for a more in-depth vision, greater overall definition of planes, better accuracy of dissection and reduced operative times, for nephrectomy with vaginal extraction for kidney donation. CONCLUSION Three-dimensional laparoscopy for living-donor nephrectomy with vaginal extraction is feasible and could become a new standard.

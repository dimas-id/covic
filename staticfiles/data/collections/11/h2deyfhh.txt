N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonists such as ketamine (KET) produce psychotic-like behavior in both humans and animal models. NMDAr hypofunction affects normal oscillatory dynamics and synaptic plasticity in key brain regions related with schizophrenia, particularly in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) induction is known to increase glutamatergic transmission. Thus, we hypothesized that LTP could mitigate the electrophysiological changes promoted by KET. We recorded HPC-PFC local field potentials and evoked responses in urethane anesthetized rats, before and after KET administration, preceded or not by LTP induction. Our results show that KET promotes an aberrant delta-high-gamma crossfrequency coupling in the PFC and an enhancement in HPC-PFC evoked responses. LTP induction prior to KET attenuates changes in synaptic efficiency and prevents the increase in cortical gamma amplitude comodulation. These findings are consistent with evidence that increased efficiency of glutamatergic receptors attenuates cognitive impairment in animal models of psychosis. Therefore, high-frequency stimulation in HPC may be a useful tool to better understand how to prevent NMDAr hypofunction effects on synaptic plasticity and oscillatory coordination in cortico-limbic circuits.

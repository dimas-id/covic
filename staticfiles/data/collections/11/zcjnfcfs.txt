We report the rapid evolution of the Aerosol Box, originally designed by Dr Hsien Yung Lai, Mennonite Christian Hospital, Taiwan [1]. The Aerosol Box was intended to protect healthcare workers performing aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), specifically tracheal intubation, by providing a physical barrier to droplet and/or aerosol exposure [2]. An increased infection rate has been reported in healthcare workers internationally, particularly when the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been inadequate or when the supply of PPE has been depleted [3]. The Aerosol Box can be made of transparent acrylic or polycarbonate sheeting, and is re-usable after careful decontamination with an appropriate cleansing agent. The original model was based on a simple cuboid design, with two access ports for arms.

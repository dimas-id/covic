Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), is highly contagious. Lifeguards are the first line of response in aquatic emergencies and they will suffer a strong exposure to risk this first summer of the Covid-19 era, so their occupational health must be rethought in their professional practice during the new normal. The main public health measure to prevent drowning is prevention, but when this fails and assistance or rescue is required, in most interventions, distancing will not be possible. The limitation of personal protective equipment (PPE) for rescue is a reality that must be known and that can affect the health of the lifeguard. A review of the current literature aimed at avoiding or minimizing the risk of contagion in the interventions carried out by rescuers in the Covid-19 era was performed. This article provides structured information on the prevention of contagion in lifeguards, the potential risks, the available PPE, and the recommendations for its proper use during rescue or prehospital care in aquatic settings.

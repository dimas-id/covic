Approximately every 100 years, as witnessed in the last two centuries, we are facing an influenza pandemic, necessitating the need to combat a novel virus strain. As a result of the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 [SARS‐CoV‐2] outbreak in January 2020, many clinical studies are being carried out with the aim of combating or eradicating the disease altogether. However, so far, developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) detection kits or vaccines has remained elusive. In this regard, the development of antiviral nanomaterials by surface engineering with enhanced specificity might prove valuable to combat this novel virus. Quantum dots (QDs) are multifaceted agents with the ability to fight against/inhibit the activity of COVID‐19 virus. This article exclusively discusses the potential role of QDs as biosensors and antiviral agents for attenuation of viral infection.

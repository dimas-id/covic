Brain death is associated with complex physiologic changes that may impact the management of the potential organ donor. Medical management is critical to actualizing the individual or familyâ€™s intent to donate and maximizing the benefit of that intent. This interval of care in the PICU begins with brain death and consent to donation and culminates with surgical organ procurement. During this phase, risks for hemodynamic instability and compromise of end organ function are high. The brain dead organ donor is in a distinct and challenging pathophysiologic condition that culminates in multifactorial shock. The potential benefits of aggressive medical management of the organ donor may include increased number of donors providing transplantable organs and increased number of organs transplanted per donor. This may improve graft function, graft survival, and patient survival in those transplanted. In this chapter, pathophysiologic changes occurring after brain death are reviewed. General and organ specific donor management strategies and logistic considerations are discussed. There is a significant opportunity for enhancing donor multi-organ function and improving organ utilization with appropriate PICU management.

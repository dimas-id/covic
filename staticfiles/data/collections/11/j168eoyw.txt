BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 'baseball' suture technique for uterine myomectomy incision closure in laparoscopic surgical enucleation of uterine leiomyoma (fibroid). MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with a 'baseball' suture technique, compared with 20 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with a standard suture method. Clinical characteristics, perioperative and follow-up data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS For the study group, compared with the standard or control group, had a significantly reduced operation time (60.15±9.97 min vs. 71.85±9.74 min) and suturing time (18.05±4.71 min vs. 28.35±3.13 min) (both p<0.05), significantly less intraoperative blood loss (93.25±19.62 ml vs. 121.50±24.87 ml) (p<0.05) and significantly less reduction in postoperative hemoglobin levels (8.9±1.97 g/L vs. 11.15±2.23 g/L) (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in duration of the use of the indwelling drainage tube, drainage volume, or time to recovery of gastrointestinal function (all, p>0.05). Following surgery, blood transfusion was given to one patient in the study group and two patients in the control group. One patient from each group had a fever. There was no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The 'baseball' suture technique for closure of the uterine incision is a safe and effective method for use in laparoscopic myomectomy. However, the long-term recovery outcomes require further study.

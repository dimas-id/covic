Abstract Astroviruses are unsegmented, positive-sense RNA viruses with ~7â€“9kb genomes. The family name derives from astron, meaning star, in Greek. These small unenveloped viruses have spikes that project about 41nm from the surface of the capsid, giving them a star-like appearance. Human astroviruses cause gastroenteritis in children and adults. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise, and abdominal pain; for the most part disease is self-limiting.

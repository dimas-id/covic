DEMANDS for new means to solve man's nutritional needs when the pressure of population intensifies or when he attempts to travel in space have suggested the use of single cell organisms as food. Hydrogenomonas eutropha, a hydrogen-fixing bacterium, could effectively control the atmosphere of a space cabin as well as providing nourishment(1). The protein is of high biological value(2) and is well tolerated even in high concentrations in rat diets(3). Human feeding trials seemed warranted and were attempted.

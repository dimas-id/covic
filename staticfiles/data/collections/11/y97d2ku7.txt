We report a case of necrotizing enterocolitis in a 30 weeks old premature infant fed with breast milk. No ischemic etiology was present. Bacteriological and parasitological investigations were found to be negative. Only, a positive latex agglutination test for Adenoviruses was detected in stools collected the day of the bloody diarrhea. Detailed microbiological examinations are emphasized by this unusual finding because the role of pathogens in this disease deserves further understanding.

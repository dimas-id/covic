Measuring respiratory resistance and elastance as a function of time, tidal volume, respiratory rate, and positive end-expiratory pressure can guide mechanical ventilation. However, current measurement techniques are limited since they are assessed intermittently at non-physiological frequencies or involve specialized equipment. To this end, we introduce ZVV, a practical approach to continuously track resistance and elastance during Variable Ventilation (VV), in which frequency and tidal volume vary from breath-to-breath. ZVV segments airway pressure and flow recordings into individual breaths, calculates resistance and elastance for each breath, bins them according to frequency or tidal volume and plots the results against bin means. ZVV's feasibility was assessed clinically in five human patients with acute lung injury, experimentally in five mice ventilated before and after lavage injury, and computationally using a viscoelastic respiratory model. ZVV provided continuous measurements in both settings, while the computational study revealed <2% estimation errors. Our findings support ZVV as a feasible technique to assess respiratory mechanics under physiological conditions. Additionally, in humans, ZVV detected a decrease in resistance and elastance with time by 12.8% and 6.2%, respectively, suggesting that VV can improve lung recruitment in some patients and can therefore potentially serve both as a dual diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

Untreated acquired auricular damage can be a psychological burden, especially for younger patients. The significance of auricular reconstruction in patients with microtia in terms of quality of life has already been demonstrated. In these patients the use of porous polyethylene combined with a temporoparietal fascia flap has proven to be a suitable method for achieving good cosmetic results. Here, we describe how to use porous polyethylene combined with an endoscopically harvested temporoparietal fascia flap and autologous skin grafts for the reconstruction of acquired partial auricle defects and present outcomes and patient benefit. Ten consecutive patients were asked to answer validated questionnaires [modified Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)] determining the effects of partial ear reconstruction on their health-related quality of life. These patients were seen regularly in our outpatient clinic for documentation and postoperative counseling. All patients returned a valid questionnaire; 80% were satisfied with the esthetic result. In retrospect, all patients would again decide to undergo surgery. The mean total GBI score was 27.8 (median 29.2, p < 0.05) reflecting an improvement of the health-related quality of life due to the operation. Odd feeling, numbness and the formation of scar tissue were the main complaints. Partial auricular reconstruction using porous polyethylene combined with an endoscopically harvested temporoparietal fascia flap and autologous skin grafts yields good esthetic results and can significantly increase patient's health-related quality of life.

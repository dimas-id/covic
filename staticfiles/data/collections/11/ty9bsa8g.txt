INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Our purpose was to verify whether extensive dissection toward the sacrospinous ligament (SSL) needed for mesh fixation during anterior compartment repair increases the risk of postoperative voiding difficulties. METHODS A total of 124 patients after anterior compartment mesh repair without simultaneous suburethral sling placement operated on in the period 2005-2012 were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. Patients with previous anti-incontinence surgery with normal urodynamics were not excluded; 30 patients with incomplete data, severe perioperative complications, and urinary retention before and after the surgery were excluded. Urinary retention was defined as post-void residual over 150 ml more than 48 h after permanent catheter removal. The rate of urinary retention after anterior compartment repair by mesh anchored to the SSL from an anterior approach (SSLS group) was compared to that following transobturator mesh repair often combined with SSL fixation from the posterior approach (TOT group). RESULTS Of the 94 patients considered for statistical analysis, 62 were from the SLSS group and 32 from the TOT group. The groups were comparable in age (mean 65.5 vs 66.3), body mass index (24.8 vs 25.9), and parity (2.4 vs 2.9). Patients from the SSLS group had higher rates of prior vaginal reconstructive (27 vs 19 %) and anti-incontinence surgery (26 vs 19 %). Postoperative urinary retention was statistically significantly more frequent in the SSLS group compared to the TOT group [(17 (27 %) vs 2 (6.25 %), odds ratio 5.7, 95 % confidence interval 1.2-26.3, p = 0.027]. Hospital discharge with self-catheterization was statistically insignificantly more frequent in the SSLS group [8 % (5) vs 3 % (1)]. CONCLUSIONS Extensive dissection needed for SSL suspension from an anterior approach may lead to more frequent postoperative voiding difficulties. This phenomenon could be explained by more considerable injury to pelvic splanchnic nerves during the dissection. A large prospective study is needed for validation of our results.

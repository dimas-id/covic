PURPOSE OF REVIEW Otitis media is a disease that is prevalent in the pediatric population, and recent twin and triplet studies have confirmed that there is a strong genetic component to susceptibility. Here, we summarize the status of current efforts to identify the specific genes underlying otitis media susceptibility and presentation. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have focused on identifying candidate genes. For example, IFN-gamma polymorphisms, allotypes of the leukocyte IgG (FcgammaR) receptors and certain haplotypes of surfactant genes were linked in pilot studies to otitis media susceptibility. The pattern of gene expression during an episode of otitis media is also being elucidated with the overall goal of providing clues as to which of these modulated genes are polymorphic and thus potentially capable of affecting otitis media susceptibility. Mucin and cathepsin protease genes were shown to exhibit these characteristics. SUMMARY In addition to the simple searches for linkages between known genes and otitis media, work is progressing within the context of genome-wide linkage studies. These efforts promise to answer some of the many questions remaining in otitis media susceptibility and pathogenesis.

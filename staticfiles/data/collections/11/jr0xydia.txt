KEY MESSAGE: This is the first evidence that replicating vectors can be successfully used for transient protein expression in BY-2 plant cell packs. ABSTRACT: Transient recombinant protein expression in plants and recently also plant cell cultures are of increasing interest due to the speed, safety and scalability of the process. Currently, studies are focussing on the design of plant virus-derived vectors to achieve higher amounts of transiently expressed proteins in these systems. Here we designed and tested replicating single and multi-cassette vectors that combine elements for enhanced replication and hypertranslation, and assessed their ability to express and particularly co-express proteins by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in tobacco BY-2 plant cell packs. Substantial yields of green and red fluorescent proteins of up to ~ 700 ng/g fresh mass were detected in the plant cells along with position-dependent expression. This is the first evidence of the ability of replicating vectors to transiently express proteins in BY-2 plant cell packs.

Traumatic lumbar hernia (TLH) is a rare presentation. Traditionally, these have been repaired via an open approach. Recurrence can be a problem due to the often limited tissue available for mesh fixation at the inferior aspect of the hernia defect. We report the successful use of bone suture anchors placed in the iliac crest during transperitoneal laparoscopy for mesh fixation to repair a recurrent TLH. This technique may be particularly useful after previous failed attempts at open TLH repair.

General anesthesia prohibits neurological examination during embolization of cerebrovascular malformations when provocative testing prior to pedicle occlusion is needed. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has the potential to fill this gap but remains relatively unexplored. We conduct a retrospective review of consecutive patients with cerebrovascular malformations treated with Onyx (ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) embolization under general anesthesia with IONM from 2009 to 2012. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs), visual evoked potential (VEPs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), and electroencephalography (EEG) were used selectively in all patients depending on the location of the malformation. Provocative testing combined with IONM was performed in 28 patients over 75 sessions. Three patients demonstrated changes in TcMEPs or ABR during provocative testing, which halted the planned embolization. Two patients demonstrated changes in baseline SSEPs after embolization, despite normal IONM during provocative testing, correlating with postprocedural contralateral weakness. Six patients developed visual deficits after arterial occlusion despite unchanged VEPs and occipital EEG during provocative testing and embolization. We therefore conclude that the sensitivity of TcMEPs and SSEPs is preferable to EEG, and we strongly caution against relying on occipital recorded VEPs to predict visual deficits.

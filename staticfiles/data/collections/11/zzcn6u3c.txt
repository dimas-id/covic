OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS The purpose of this study is to present a new approach for treatment of Zenker's diverticulum using the LigaSure (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) technique. STUDY DESIGN A consecutive study with follow-up of 15 patients with Zenker's diverticulum endoscopically treated using the LigaSure. METHODS All patients underwent an endoscopic division of the bridge between the esophagus and the diverticulum through a rigid diverticuloscope using the LigaSure. Variables such as demographics, symptoms, surgical details, complications, and outcome were collected during admission, and all patients were followed up 5 to 14 months after discharge. RESULTS The median age of patients was 76 years. The diverticula measured between 2 and 7 cm. The median time of surgery was 33 minutes. All patients but one resumed oral intake within 24 hours. One patient experienced prolonged coughing and vomiting immediately postoperatively and was hours later diagnosed with a perforation. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotics. At follow-up this patient was on a normal diet. At follow-up after 2 to 8 weeks, all patients were relieved of their preoperative symptoms. At follow-up after 5 to 14 months, all but three had relief of all symptoms. Two patients had relapse of the diverticulum and one had relapse of a stricture known from before the diverticulotomy. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that treating Zenker's diverticulum using the LigaSure instrument safely improves the patients condition. As a new operative instrument, the LigaSure technique constitutes in our opinion a valid and easy alternative for treatment of Zenker's diverticulum compared to other endoscopic techniques.

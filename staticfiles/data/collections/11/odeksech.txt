Abstract In the past decade adenovirus-based vaccines have progressed from preclinical studies, which universally showed the vectors’ high immunogenicity, to testing in humans. Clinical trials showed that adenovirus vectors are well tolerated by humans. They induce robust immune responses that can be expanded by booster immunization. The effect of preexisting neutralizing antibodies on vectors’ immunogenicity appears to be less severe than was observed in experimental animals and can readily be circumvented by using vectors to which most humans lack neutralizing antibodies. Additional clinical studies are needed to firmly establish the efficacy of adenoviral vector vaccines.

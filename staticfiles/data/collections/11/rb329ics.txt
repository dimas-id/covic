BACKGROUND Robotic surgery offers 3D visualization and the advantage of the usage of multi-articulated instruments with superior dexterity. Theoretically, it can overcome many limitations of laparoscopic rectal surgery in the narrow pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2010 and January 2011, the patients who underwent robotic rectal resection for cancer were retrospectively evaluated in terms of demographics, operative data, complications, the duration of hospital stay, and histopathological data. RESULTS Thirty consecutive patients made up of 13 female and 17 male patients underwent robotic rectal resection. Sphincter-saving mesorectal excision was performed in 27 patients. Of these, there were 19 total and 8 partial mesorectal excisions. The mean operative time was 270 min (175-480 min). The median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days (4-20 days). No operation was converted. The complication rate was 13.3%. One patient died due to colonic necrosis caused by Drummond artery deficiency (3.3%). The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 15 (3-38), and the distal resection margin was 4 cm (2-8). Histopathological evaluation revealed that the mesorectum resection was complete in all patients. CONCLUSION Robotic rectal surgery (hybrid or totally robotic) is a safe and feasible procedure when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons.

In this article, we propose a method to construct self orthogonal matrix, orthogonal matrix and anti orthogonal matrix over the finite field. Orthogonal matrices has numerous applications in cryptography, so here we demonstrate the application of weighted orthogonal matrix into cryptography. Using the proposed method of construction we see that it is very easy to transmit the private key and can easily convert the encrypted message into original message and at the same time it will be difficult to get the key matrix for intruder.

Disastrous epidemic such as SARS, H1N1, or smallpox released by some terrorists can significantly affect people’s life. The outbreak of infections in Europe in 2011 is another example. The infection, from a strain of Escherichia coli, can lead to kidney failure and death and is difficult to treat with antibiotics. A recent example of epidemic outbreak was the 2014–2015 Ebola pandemic in West Africa, which infected approximately 28,610 individuals and approximately 11,300 lives were lost in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. It is now widely recognized that a large-scale epidemic diffusion can conceivably cause many deaths and more people of permanent sequela, which presents a severe challenge to the local or regional health-care systems.

Advances in image-guided, catheter-based interventions have shown great potential to improve outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism. Catheter-directed thrombolysis has been shown in one randomized controlled trial to reduce the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome in patients with acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis; data from a larger national institute of health trial are expected in early 2017. The use of catheter-directed thrombolysis is also being increasingly considered for patients with submassive or massive pulmonary embolism. Preliminary studies suggest that endovascular stent placement and ablative therapies may be used to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life in severely affected patients with established post-thrombotic syndrome. In this article, we summarize the risks and benefits of endovascular venous thromboembolism therapies as currently understood, highlight clinical situations where their benefit may outweigh risks, and describe ongoing and upcoming pivotal research initiatives with multidisciplinary participation.

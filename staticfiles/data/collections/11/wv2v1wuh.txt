AIM: To identify and summarise the common findings from 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections in children MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical characteristics and radiological findings (chest radiography and chest computed tomography [CT]) of nine children infected with the 2019-nCoV were reviewed in this retrospective case series RESULTS: Among the children, six had fever (including two children with cough), one had only cough, one had a stuffy nose when initially diagnosed, and one was an asymptomatic carrier Chest radiographs seemed mostly normal in six cases whereas increased and/or disordered bilateral bronchovascular shadows and dense hilar shadows were seen in three cases Chest CT exhibited no obvious abnormal signs in four cases Typical CT findings included patchy, peripheral ground-grass opacities, subpleural lamellar dense shadows, and parenchymal bands Pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cavitation, and pleural thickening were absent CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations and radiological findings of the 2019-nCoV-infected children were mild and lacked a typical pattern

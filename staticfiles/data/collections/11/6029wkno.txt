Most childhood tumors will first present to a physician; some tumors will present in an atypical manner and may mimic a surgical condition. The diagnosis may be missed if the surgeon is not aware of the possibility of cancer. A very great number of rare presentations of childhood cancer have been described in the literature. It is important that the surgeon who is not experienced in the management of childhood cancer is aware that an apparently benign condition could be a manifestation of an underlying malignancy.

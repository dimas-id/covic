BACKGROUND Laparoscopic repair of the hiatal hernia is associated with a recurrence rate between 12% and 42% depending on the defect size. Although the impact of hiatal reinforcement on long-term recurrence remains controversial, the main limitation of this approach has been the risk of adverse events related with the use of synthetic materials in the vicinity of the esophagus. METHODS A total of 14 female domestic pigs underwent laparoscopic primary hiatal hernia repair of a simulated defect in the esophageal hiatus. Seven of the hiatal repairs were reinforced with an extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold, whereas the remaining seven served as primary repair controls. Animals were survived for 8 wk. At necropsy, after gross morphologic evaluation, samples were sent for mechanical testing and histology. RESULTS The repaired defect site reinforced with ECM scaffolds showed a robust closure of the crura in all cases with a smooth peritoneal-like structure covering the entire repair. Average load at failure of the treated group was found to be significantly stronger than that of the controls (185.8 ± 149.7 g versus 57.5 ± 57.5 g, P < 0.05). Similarly, the stiffness was significantly higher in the treated animals (57.5 ± 26.9 g/mm versus 19.1 ± 17.5 g/mm; P < 0.01). Interestingly, there was no difference in elongation at failure (7.62 ± 2.02 mm versus 7.87 ± 3.28 mm; P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS In our animal survival model, we have provided evidence that the addition of an ECM to augment a primary hiatal repair leads to tissue characteristics that may decrease the possibility of early failure of the repair. This may translate to decreased recurrence rates. Further study is necessary.

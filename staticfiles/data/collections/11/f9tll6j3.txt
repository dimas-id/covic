Disorders of the sense of smell can be frustrating for both the patient and physician. Ongoing research in this field has provided insight into the possible mechanisms for smell loss; however, therapy is still limited. Commercially distributed smell testing kits and newer screening tests using material available in all clinical settings have made diagnosis and measurement of the degree of impairment available to all physicians. A detailed history and physical examination are the most powerful tools in the evaluation of smell disorders, whereas imaging studies are reserved for preoperative planning or detailed assessment of positive physical findings.

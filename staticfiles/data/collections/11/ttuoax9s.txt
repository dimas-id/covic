In this work in progress, we demonstrate a new use-case for the ENIGMA system. The ENIGMA system using the XGBoost implementation of gradient boosted decision trees has demonstrated high capability to learn to guide the E theorem prover’s inferences in real-time. Here, we strip E to the bare bones: we replace the KBO term ordering with an identity relation as the minimal possible ordering, disable literal selection, and replace evolved strategies with a simple combination of the clause weight and FIFO (first in first out) clause evaluation functions. We experimentally demonstrate that ENIGMA can learn to guide E as well as the smart, evolved strategies even without these standard automated theorem prover functionalities. To this end, we experiment with XGBoost’s meta-parameters over a dozen loops.

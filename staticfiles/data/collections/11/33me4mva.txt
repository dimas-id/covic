BACKGROUND Recanalization rates and patient outcomes in acute occlusion of the carotid terminus have previously been poor. The use of stent-retrievers has resulted in better recanalization and patient outcomes. We sought to compare outcomes in patients treated with stent-retrievers to outcomes in older techniques. METHODS We retrospectively compared a stent-retriever cohort to a historical cohort. We evaluated recanalization rates and good outcomes (defined as mRS < 2 at 30 days or 10 point drop in NIHSS). RESULTS There were twenty patients treated with stent-retrievers versus nine without. The recanalization rate in patients treated with stent retrievers was significantly higher than that of other modalities (90% vs 33%, p=0.004). Good outcomes were significantly higher in the stent retriever cohort (70% vs 22%, p=0.041). CONCLUSION The use of stent-retrievers in patients with carotid "T" occlusions shows promise in comparison to older techniques. A randomized trial comparing stent-retriever therapy to IV thrombolysis is warranted to determine the efficacy of this new generation of devices.

Abstract The world was struck by surprise when a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic started in 2003 in China. This disease had never been observed in man before; the SARS-Coronavirus causing the disease was unknown. With the uncertainty about the future impact of this epidemic, an important international collaboration started spontaneously sharing scientific knowledge and reagents. Resources became quickly available, and public and private efforts were undertaken to develop rapidly a vaccine. We will discuss here the importance of the international collaboration and the availability of funding. Moreover, we will review the most important and challenging steps during the industrial development of the SARS vaccine highlighting the difficulties in terms of safety working with such a highly pathogenic, unknown virus. We will emphasize the industrial perspectives on inactivation and decontamination experiments, the selection of the most promising vaccine candidate, the production process and the choice and use of animal models in such a pressing and difficult situation. Finally, we will briefly review the unique regulatory environment created during this period for the development of a SARS vaccine.

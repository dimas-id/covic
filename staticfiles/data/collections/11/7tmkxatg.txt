The article deals with a comparative analysis of the parameters of the polymerization in physiological conditions of three commercially available alkyl cyanoacrylates, n-butyl cyanoacrylate (GLUBRAN 2), n-hexyl cyanoacrylate (IFABOND), and n-octyl cyanoacrylate (EVOBOND), the cell behavior of the corresponding polymers and the application of these adhesives in the fixation of surgical polypropylene meshes for hernia repair in an animal model of rabbits. The results obtained demonstrate that the curing process depends on the nature of the alkyl residue of the ester group of cyanoacrylate molecules, being the heat of polymerization lower for the octyl derivative in comparison with the hexyl and butyl, and reaching a maximum temperature of 35 Â°C after a time of mixing with physiological fluids of 60-70 s. The cell behavior demonstrates that the three systems do not present toxicity for fibroblasts and low adhesion of cells, which is a positive result for application as tissue adhesives, especially for the fixation of abdominal polypropylene meshes for hernia repair. The animal experimentation indicates the excellent tolerance of the meshes fixed with the cyanoacrylic adhesives, during at least a period of 90 d, and guarantees a good adhesion for the application of hernia repair meshes.

In response to internal and external insults, the intestinal lining undergoes various types of epithelial adaptation or pathologic distress via stress-responsive eIF2α kinase signaling and subsequent cellular reprogramming. As a vital platform for growth factor-linked adaptive signaling, caveolae were evaluated for epithelial modulation of the insulted gut. Patients under ulcerative insult displayed enhanced expression of caveolin-1, the main structural component of caveolae, which was positively associated with expression of protein kinase R (PKR), the ribosomal stress-responsive eIF2α kinase. PKR-linked biological responses were simulated in experimental gut models of ribosome-inactivating stress using mice and Caenorhabditis elegans. Caveolar activation counteracted the expression of wound-protective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its target genes, such as chemokines that were pivotal for epithelial integrity in the ribosome-inactivated gut. Mechanistic findings regarding ribosomal inactivation-associated disorders in the gut barrier provide crucial molecular evidence for detrimental caveolar actions against EGFR-mediated epithelial protection in patients with IBD.

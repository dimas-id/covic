COVID-19 is a new disease, based on currently available limited information, older adults and people of any age who have severe underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People of all age groups are also at risk. Healthcare providers have always been the professionals most exposed to the risk of contracting to any kind of infection due to the nature of their profession. Elective interventions have been postponed to give care of patients with COVID-19. However, some interventions cannot be delayed, such as trauma surgery, acute abdomen, and emergency endoscopies. To maintain the sustainability of the healthcare system, the protection of healthcare providers should be the top priority. On the other hand, patients, who need emergency healthcare, should also be provided with appropriate treatment. Healthcare professionals should choose a treatment method appropriately in the circumstances to protect themselves and their patients as much as possible. This paper aims to summarize how a surgeon may act appropriately when an intervention is inevitable during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background. Interest exits concerning the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in patients with Covid-19 disease. Objectives. To perform a systematic review on mortality associated to the use of ACEi in patients with Covid 19 disease. Methods. Search in Medline (PubMed) and in ISI Web of Knowledge; use of other sources. Results. A total of 19 articles were evaluated. Four studies were selected and used to produce the meta-analyses. These four studies involved a total number of 1.423 patients treated with ACEi and 11.868 not treated with ACEi. Significant heterogeneity was seen concerning mortality associated to the use of ACEi in the context of Covid-19 disease. One report showed significantly decreased mortality associated to ACEi use, but this finding was not confirmed by the three other studies. No significant difference in mortality was seen in the meta-analysis (ACEi users versus non-users; random effects; odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.94; P=0.84). When compared to mortality in patients treated with angiotensin receptor blockers, mortality of patients treated with ACEi was not significantly different, although a trend was noted to exist (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 1.34; P=0.32). The population studied in the report showing decreased mortality associated to ACEi use had a mean age under 50 years, whereas two other reports had a mean or median patient age over 60 years. Conclusions. The data now presented argue in favor of carrying out clinical trials studying ACEi in Covid-19 patients, to explore the hypothesis that ACEi use has a protective effect in populations with a mean age under 50 years, but not necessarily in those with a mean age over 60 years.

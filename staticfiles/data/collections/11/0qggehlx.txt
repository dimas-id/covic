Acute portal vein thrombosis is a rare but severe complication of intra-abdominal infection. It can be life-threatening, given the risk of developing liver abscess and subsequent liver failure. Various types of hereditary thrombophilia are known risk factors for acute portal vein thrombosis. In addition to surgical treatment and potent antibiotic therapy, systemic administration of anticoagulants and locoregional trans-catheter delivery of thrombolytic agents are known to be effective. We present a case report of acute portal vein thrombosis with pylephlebitis caused by acute appendicitis, successfully treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis through the operatively recanalized umbilical vein. The umbilical vein is a promising access route to the portal vein. Therefore, this procedure is an effective and preferred treatment option for portal septic thrombosis, particularly because it does not require puncture of the liver parenchyma or catheterization through an infected peritoneal cavity.

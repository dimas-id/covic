The 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa was unprecedented in its geographical distribution, scale, and toll on public health infrastructure. Standard public health measures were rapidly overwhelmed, and many projections on outbreak progression through the region were dire. At the beginning of the outbreak there were no treatments or vaccines that had been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing EVD, limiting health care providers to offer supportive care under extremely challenging circumstances and at great risk to themselves. Over time, however, drugs and vaccines in the development pipeline were prioritized based on all available research data and were moved forward for evaluation in clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy. The armamentarium against EVD eventually included biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccines as well as small molecule therapeutics such as small interfering RNAs and nucleoside analogs. This article provides a high-level overview of the interventions and prophylactics considered for use in the outbreak and discusses the challenges faced when attempting to deploy investigational countermeasures in the midst of an evolving epidemic.

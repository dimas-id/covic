OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a conventional ω-6 lipid infusion and a fish oil based (ω-3) lipid infusion for parenteral nutrition on neutrophil function, lipid mediators, and plasma free fatty acids. DESIGN AND SETTING: Open-label, randomized, pilot study in a university hospital medical intensive care unit and experimental laboratory. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients with septic shock and eight healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: Patients (five per group) requiring parenteral nutrition received intravenously either a ω-3 or a ω-6 lipid emulsion for a 10-day period. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: At baseline levels of plasma free fatty acids were elevated several-fold, including high concentrations of the ω-6 lipid precursor arachidonic acid (AA). Neutrophils isolated from septic patients displayed markedly reduced responsiveness to ex vivo stimulation, including lipid mediator generation [leukotrienes (LT), PAF], respiratory burst, and phosphoinositide hydrolysis signaling. Under the ω-6 lipid infusion regimen abnormalities in plasma free fatty acids and impairment of neutrophil functions persisted or worsened. In contrast, a rapid switch in the plasma free fatty acid fraction to predominance of the ω-3 acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid over AA occurred in response to ω-3 lipid infusion. LTB(5), in addition to LTB(4), appeared upon neutrophil stimulation originating from these patients, and neutrophil function was significantly improved in the ω-3 lipid group. CONCLUSIONS: ω-3 vs. ω-6 lipid emulsions differentially influence the plasma free fatty acid profile with impact on neutrophil functions. Lipid-based parenteral nutrition in septic patients may thus exert profound influence on sequelae and status of immunocompetence and inflammation.

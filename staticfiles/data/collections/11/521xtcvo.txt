We describe a 2 weeks corrected gestational age infant admitted in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated to Bordetella pertussis and Coronavirus infection. He developed leukocytosis as soon as ARDS required intubation and aggressive mechanical ventilation: hence he underwent 3 early therapeutic leukapheresis treatments in order to avoid the worsening of related cardiopulmonary complications, according to recent literature on pertussis infection in infants. The infant was discharged from PICU healthy.

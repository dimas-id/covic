Both the confinement itself and the stress induced by the COVID-19 virus pandemic can lead to significant disruptions in habitual rhythms and sleep. Sleep experts from the Sleep and Biological Rhythms in Psychiatry section (SoPsy) of the French Association for Biological Psychiatry and Neuropsychopharmacology (AFPBN) and the French Society of Sleep Research and Medicine (SFRMS), in partnership with the Morph√©e network and the National Institute of Sleep and Vigilance (INSV), offer recommendations on how to sleep well and to keep your rhythms. Specific recommendations are addressed on the one hand to adults and on the other hand to parents for their children. People affected by mood disorders (depression, bipolar disorder, etc.) should particularly pay attention to maintaining routines during this period in order to maintain a stable mood. Self-management strategies are suggested to strengthen the biological clock, every day! The recommendations include tips for day and night, but also some specific advices for this context, to limit stress exposure and to improve its management. Finally, useful online resources and links are suggested.

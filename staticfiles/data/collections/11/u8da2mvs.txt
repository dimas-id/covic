Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a highly contagious disease that results in enormous economic losses in the global poultry sector. Lactic acid bacteria are an appealing vehicle for the safe and effective delivery of heterologous protein antigens. Oral administration of the commensal bacterium Lactococcus lactis expressing recombinant fusion proteins has been used to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses. In this study, a Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 strain co-expressing the outer membrane protein (Omp) H of the microfold (M) cell-targeting ligand and the viral capsid protein (VP)2 antigen of IBDV was genetically engineered, and its immunopotentiating capacity as an oral and injected vaccine in chickens was evaluated. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that VP2-OmpH was expressed in the cytoplasm of cells and had high immunoreactivity. An in vivo study showed that in the absence of any adjuvant, the recombinant L. lactis VP2-OmpH strain stimulated the immune response and protected against very virulent IBDV challenge in 100% and 80% of chickens immunized by injection and oral administration, respectively. Moreover, the antiviral neutralizing antibody titers induced by injection administration were higher than those induced by oral administration. Mucosal secretory IgA titers induced by oral administration were higher than those induced by injection administration. These results suggested that the recombinant L. lactis VP2-OmpH strain is a promising candidate vaccine to prevent IBDV infection.

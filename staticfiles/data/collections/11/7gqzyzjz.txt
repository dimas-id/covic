COVID‐19, the disease resulting from infection by a novel coronavirus: SARS‐Cov2 that has rapidly spread since November 2019 leading to a global pandemic. SARS‐Cov2 has infected over 4 million people and caused over 290,000 deaths worldwide. Although most cases are mild, a subset of patients develop a severe and atypical presentation of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) that is characterised by a cytokine release storm (CRS). Paradoxically, treatment with anti‐inflammatory agents and immune regulators has been associated with worsening of ARDS. We hypothesize that the intrinsic circadian clock of the lung and the immune system may regulate individual components of CRS and thus chronotherapy may be used to effectively manage ARDS in COVID‐19 patients.

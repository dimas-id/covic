Over the past few years, nucleosides have maintained a prominent role as one of the cornerstones of antiviral and anticancer therapeutics, and many approaches to nucleoside drug design have been pursued. One such approach involves flexibility in the sugar moiety of nucleosides, for example, in the highly successful anti-HIV and HBV drug tenofovir. In contrast, introduction of flexibility to the nucleobase scaffold has only more recently gained significance with the invention of our fleximers. The history, development, and some biological relevance for this innovative class of nucleosides are detailed herein.

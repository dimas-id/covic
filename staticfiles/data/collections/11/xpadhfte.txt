Liver disease in ferrets is often subclinical and underdiagnosed. Clinical pathology and diagnostic imaging are needed to guide clinicians but definite diagnosis is based on histopathologic lesions. Inflammatory digestive conditions can lead to ascending tract infection and hepatobiliary inflammation. Ferrets have a specific sensitivity to hepatic lipidosis. Incidence of hepatic neoplasia is high in ferrets. After a summary of anatomy and physiology of the ferret liver, hepatic diseases known in ferret species are reviewed with their subsequent diagnostic procedures.

BACKGROUND: Although emerging data demonstrated mortality of young COVID‐19 patients, but no data reported the risk factors of mortality for those young patients, and whether obesity is a risk for young COVID‐19 patients remains unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including 13 young patients died of COVID‐19 and 40 matched survivors. Logistic regression was employed to characterize the risk factors of mortality in young obese COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: Most of the young deceased COVID‐19 patients were mild cases at the time of admission, but the disease progressed rapidly featured by the higher severity of Patchy shadows (100.00% vs. 48.70%, P = 0.006), pleural thickening (61.50% vs. 12.80%, P = 0.012), mild pericardial effusion (76.90% vs. 0.00%, P < 0.001). Most importantly, the deceased patients manifested higher BMI (OR = 1.354, 95% CI = 1.075‐1.704, P = 0.010), inflammatory‐related index CRP (OR = 1.014, 95% CI = 1.003‐1.025, P = 0.014), cardiac injury biomarker hs‐cTnI (OR = 1.420, 95% CI = 1.112‐1.814, P = 0.005), and increased coagulation activity biomarker D‐Dimer (OR = 418.7, P = 0.047), as compared to that of survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support that obesity could be a risk factor associated with high mortality in young COVID‐19 patients, while aggravated inflammatory response, enhanced cardiac injury and increased coagulation activity are likely to be the mechanisms contributing to the high mortality.

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus which affects chickens of all ages. IBV mainly causes respiratory disease but can also result in reduced weight gain, reduced egg production, increased frequency of abnormal eggs and increased rates of mortality. Vaccination is the most important way to control the disease. Nevertheless, novel strains of infectious bronchitis (IB) continue to emerge in the field. In order to respond promptly, combinations of existing IB vaccines are frequently tested to see whether they can provide cross-protection. The efficacy of a combination of vaccines based on Massachusetts, Dutch and QX-like IB strains against emerging IB Israel variant 2 and IB 793B strains was assessed by means of four challenge studies. At least 80% of the birds vaccinated with IB H120 (Mass type) combined with IB D274 (Dutch type) followed by a QX-like IB vaccine booster or vaccinated with a combination of IB H120, IB D274 and QX-like IB were protected against a challenge with IB 793B. In addition, IB 1263 (Mass type) boosted by QX-like IB showed an 85% protection following challenge with IB 793B. A combination of IB H120 and IB D274 boosted by QX-like IB vaccine conferred 70% protection whilst H120 and IB D274 combination on its own showed 61.1% protection against Israel variant 2 challenge. IB 1263 boosted by a QX-like IB vaccine showed 50% protection against IB Israel variant 2. Therefore, it can be concluded that a combination of the IB H120, IB D274 and QX-like IB confers broad protection against different non-related virulent IB strains.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has a number of well-established acute and chronic issues that can require revisional surgical procedures. There is no existing data to evaluate conversion of band patients with body mass index (BMI)<35 kg/m(2) from LAGB to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This study aims to report on the indications for and the safety profile of conversion of the LAGB to RYGB in patients with BMI<35 kg/m(2). METHODS A review of data from 200 consecutive conversions of LAGB to RYGB was conducted. Fifty-two patients whose BMI was<35 kg/m(2) were included in this analysis. Indications for conversion, technical details, early morbidity, length of hospital stay, and weight loss data were assessed. RESULTS Laparoscopic conversion to RYGB was performed in 100% of patients. The median BMI pre-RYGB was 32.8 kg/m(2). The most common indication for surgery was weight regain after removal of LAGB (28.8%). There was no mortality. Early morbidity was seen in 25% of patients; the most common complication was stricture of the gastrojejunal anastomosis (9 patients). CONCLUSION Morbidity resulting from conversion of LAGB to RYGB in patients with BMI <35 kg/m(2) is similar to that seen in the BMI>35 kg/m(2) population. The procedure is technically challenging and morbidity rates are higher than those reported for surgically 'na√Øve' patients. It is recommended that this procedure be undertaken by appropriately trained surgeons in high-volume bariatric centers to optimize safety and outcomes.

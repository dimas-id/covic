Aim: Renal dysfunction may influence the colonization of gastric mucosa by urea‐splitting bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, by increasing urea concentrations in the gastric juice. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of H. pylori in patients with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD), receiving long‐term haemodialysis treatment. Methods: This study included 40 sera from patients with ESRD (29 male and 11 female) undergoing periodic haemodialysis; mean time of treatment was 42.6 months. Using ELISA technique, we investigated the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against H. pylori as well as IgG CagA (antibodies specific for CagA(+) strains of H. pylori). Sera from 40 healthy blood donors were used as a control group. Results: H. pylori IgG antibodies were detected in 32 out of 40 (80%) patients in the dialysis group, while 31/40 (77.5%) tested positive for IgA. IgG CagA antibodies were present in 13 out of 40 (32.5%). Prevalence of H. pylori IgG, IgA and CagA IgG antibodies in the control group was 33, 7 and 15%, respectively. Conclusions: Although international data suggest that prevalence of H. pylori infection is the same in ESRD patients as in healthy individuals, in our study that seems not to be the case. The higher blood and gastric juice urea levels may be a risk factor (among many others), but more studies are required in order to understand the relation of H. pylori infection in this group of patients.

INTRODUCTION Primary spontaneous hemopneumothorax (PSHP) is an accumulation of blood and air in the pleural space without trauma or obvious etiology. It is a rare surgical emergency and may lead to hypovolemic shock if not treated. Early and fast recognition will improve patient outcomes. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE We present a case of PSHP in a young male utilizing the uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) through the same incisional site of the thoracostomy tube. The patient made an uneventful recovery. DISCUSSION VATS has become the first line and the gold standard surgical management of most thoracic surgeries. In case of PSHP, some thoracic surgeons still skeptical about the minimal invasive approach in such emergency. Applying the concept of uniportal technique, which can be used for diagnostic as well as major therapeutic purposes. There is vast literature that support the notion that it reduces postoperative pain and paresthesia and lead to fast patient recovery. CONCLUSION As demonstrated in our case, uniportal VATS is safe and effective in the management of PSHP.

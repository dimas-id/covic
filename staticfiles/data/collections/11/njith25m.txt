Tantalate is considered as a valuable and efficient luminescence host because of its intense absorption in the ultraviolet area and excellent chemical properties. In this work, a series of pure YTaO(4):Eu(3+) and/or Tb(3+) crystals were prepared via a sol–gel combustion method. The morphology, structure, and optical properties of the samples were discussed in detail. The Eu(3+), Tb(3+) co-doped YTaO(4) samples are consisted of small spherical particles of around 18 nm. The prepared YTaO(4):Tb(3+) and/or Eu(3+) samples exhibit the characteristic wide excitation band around 210–300 nm, the characteristic narrow red emission of Eu(3+) ((5)D(0) → (7)F(2)) transitions and green emission of the Tb(3+) ((5)D(4) → (7)F(5)) transitions when excited by UV light. It is focused on the energy transfer processes from the YTaO(4) to Tb(3+) as well as Eu(3+) ions and from Tb(3+) to Eu(3+) ions of YTaO(4):Eu(3+)/Tb(3+) phosphors. Color-tunable emissions are realized through adjusting the types of rare earth ion (Eu(3+) and Tb(3+)) and relative doping concentrations excited by a single wavelength. That is to say, the obtained Tb(3+) and Eu(3+) co-doped YTaO(4) phosphors have a promising prospect in lasers, white light diodes (WLED), fluorescent lamp, and field emission display devices, etc.

The role of statisticians in society is to provide tools, techniques, and guidance with regards to how much to trust data. This role is increasingly more important with more data and more misinformation than ever before. The American Statistical Association recently released two statements on p-values, and provided four guiding principles. We evaluate their claims using these principles and find that they failed to adhere to them. In this age of distrust, we have an opportunity to be role models of trustworthiness, and responsibility to take it.

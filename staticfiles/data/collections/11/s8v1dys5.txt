INTRODUCTION Several near-infrared spectroscopy oximeters are commercially available for clinical use, with lack of standardization among them. Accordingly, cerebral oxygen saturation thresholds for hypoxia/ischemia identified in studies conducted with INVOS(TM) models do not necessarily apply to other devices. In this study, the measurements made with both INVOS(TM) and EQUANOX(TM) oximeters on the forehead of 10 patients during conventional cardiac surgery are directly compared, in order to evaluate the interchangeability of these two devices in clinical practice. METHODS Cerebral oxygen saturation measurements were collected from both INVOS(TM) 5100C and EQUANOX(TM) 7600 before anesthetic induction (baseline), two minutes after tracheal intubation, at cardiopulmonary bypass onset/offset, at aortic cross-clamping/unclamping, at the end of surgery and whenever at least one of the two devices measured a reduction in cerebral oxygen saturation equal to or greater than 20% of the baseline value. Bland-Altman analysis was used to compare the bias and limits of agreement between the two devices. RESULTS A total of 140 paired measurements were recorded. The mean bias between INVOS(TM) and EQUANOX(TM) was -5.1%, and limits of agreement were ±16.37%. Considering the values as percent of baseline, the mean bias was -1.43% and limits of agreement were ±16.47. A proportional bias was observed for both absolute values and changes from baseline. CONCLUSIONS INVOS(TM) and EQUANOX(TM) do not seem to be interchangeable in measuring both absolute values and dynamic changes of cerebral oxygen saturation during cardiac surgery. Large investigations, with appropriate design, are needed in order to identify any device-specific threshold.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency rooms are faced with major challenges because they act as the interface between outpatient and inpatient care. The dynamics of the pandemic forced emergency care at the University Hospital MÃ¼nster to extensively adjust their processes, which had to be carried out in the shortest time possible. This included the establishment of an outpatient coronavirus test center and a medical student-operated telephone hotline. Inside the hospital, new isolation capacities in the emergency room and a dedicated COVID-19 ward were set up. The patient flow was reorganized using flow diagrams for both the outpatient and inpatient areas. The general and special emergency management was optimized for the efficient treatment of COVID-19-positive patients and the staff were trained in the use of protective equipment. This report of our experience is intended to support other emergency departments in their preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic.

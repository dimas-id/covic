In this paper an adaptive computational temporal-causal network model is presented to analyse the dynamic and adaptive relationships between cannabis usage, anxiety and sleep. The model has been used to simulate different well-known scenarios varying from intermittent usage to longer periods of usage interrupted by attempts to quit and to constant usage based on full addiction. It is described how the model has been verified and validated by empirical information from the literature.

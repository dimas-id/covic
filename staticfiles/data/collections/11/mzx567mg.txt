Abstract An accurate virus diagnosis invariably requires laboratory testing of clinical specimens for the presence of virus, viral antigens, or specific antibodies. The past few decades have seen a major revolution in the operation of virus diagnostic laboratories and in their role in clinical patient management. Virus isolation has been largely replaced by sensitive nucleic acid detection assays and the measurement of specific antibodies at a very high level of sensitivity and specificity.

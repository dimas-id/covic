Twelve hybrid cell lines secreting monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgG) specific of bovine enteric Coronavirus (BEC strain G110) have been obtained following fusion of non secreting variant of the myeloma P3X63Ag8, SP2O, which splenic lymphocytes of Mice immunized against this virus. Antibodies thus obtained have been studied by indirect immunofluorescence and seroneutralization with cells infected by two french strains G110 and F15 and an american strain of Coronavirus: NCDCV. Immunochemical studies have confirmed this specificity.

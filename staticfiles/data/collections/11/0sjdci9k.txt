A 53-year-old man presented with high fever and a non-productive cough but had no recent travel history. He deteriorated clinically very rapidly and was intubated. The endotracheal tube microbiological culture isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae. On chest computed tomography, the presence of mixed ground-glass airspace opacities, patchy consolidation and a ‘crazy paving’ appearance was atypical for Klebsiella infection. As there was also a lack of cavitating nodules, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion, atypical pneumonia due to COVID-19 was diagnosed. The patient tested positive for COVID-19. He was isolated and subsequently recovered.

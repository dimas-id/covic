We report that 75% of conventionally housed 3- to 4-week-old swine already have detectable activated alveolar macrophages as measured by cytotoxicity of tumor cells. These macrophages can not be further activated by the biological response modifier N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine-2H(2)O (MDP). These macrophages lose cytotoxic activity when cultured for 24 h and this loss of activity can not be reversed by MDP. We suggest that MDP biological response modifier therapy of swine alveolar macrophages may not be a useful technique in preventing respiratory disease in swine.

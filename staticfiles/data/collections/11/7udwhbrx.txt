Use of phyto-medicine and digitalization of phyto-compounds has been fallen enthralling field of science in recent years. Quercetin, a flavonoid with brilliant citron yellow pigment, is typically found in fruits and leafy vegetables in reasonable amount. Quercetinâ€™s potentials as an antioxidant, immune-modulator, antiinflammatory, anti-cancer, and others have been the subject of interest in this review. Although, profiling the insights in to the molecular characterization of quercetin with various targets provided the loop-holes in understanding the knowledge for the aforementioned mechanisms, still necessitates research globally to unearth it completely. Thus, the available science on the synthesis and significant role played by the old molecule - quercetin which does wonders even now have been vividly explained in the present review to benefit the scientific community.

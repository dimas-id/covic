We performed a surveillance study for COVID-19 in March-April 2020 among asymptomatic HCWs in a specialized Infectious Diseases hospital in Naples, Italy. All HCWs underwent two rounds of molecular and serology testing for SARS-CoV-2. 115 HCWs were tested: two infections were identified by PT-PCR and two HCWs were SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive. The overall prevalence of current or probable-previous infection was 3.4%. The infection rate among HCWs is reasonable low. Most of the infected HCWs had been asymptomatic, which supports the need for periodic screening of HCWs for COVID-19.

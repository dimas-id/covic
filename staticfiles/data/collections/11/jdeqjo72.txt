Abstract Risk is a constant feature of life. Librarians have often relied on others – including first responders, public health authorities and consultants – to help them prepare for and respond to risk. Many libraries lack effective disaster plans, which should cover the broad spectrum of risks: natural, technological, human-caused, proximity, security and enterprise. Human nature, exemplified by apathy, carelessness and inattention, can hinder planning efforts.

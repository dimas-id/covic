COVID-19 has been causing tragic outcomes all over the world. On one island nation, North Cyprus, that has been politically isolated from the rest of the world due to a very complicated history and political stance, the rapid enforcement of lockdown measures, despite having negative psychological effects, helped interfere with the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve. We propose that the traumas of the past may have caused resilient factors when faced with the psychological impact of COVID-19, and lack of trust toward the capacities of governing bodies may have caused people take strict precautions to help contain the spread of the virus.

In the coming decades, many developed countries in the world are expecting the "greying" of their populations. This phenomenon poses unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems. Aging is one of the most important risk factors for infections and a myriad of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. A common denominator that is implicated in these diseases is the immune system. The immune system consists of the innate and adaptive arms that complement each other to provide the host with a holistic defense system. While the diverse interactions between multiple arms of the immune system are necessary for its function, this complexity is amplified in the aging immune system as each immune cell type is affected differently-resulting in a conundrum that is especially difficult to target. Furthermore, certain cell types, such as Î³Î´ T cells, do not fit categorically into the arms of innate or adaptive immunity. In this review, we will first introduce the human Î³Î´ T cell family and its ligands before discussing parallels in mice. By covering the ontogeny and homeostasis of Î³Î´ T cells during their lifespan, we will better capture their evolution and responses to age-related stressors. Finally, we will identify knowledge gaps within these topics that can advance our understanding of the relationship between Î³Î´ T cells and aging, as well as age-related diseases such as cancer.

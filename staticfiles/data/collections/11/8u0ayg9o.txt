Objectives To compare analgesia nociception index (ANI) values, visual analog scale (VAS) values, and hemodynamic parameters in hysteroscopy patients who received remifentanil and dexmedetomidine during general anesthesia. Methods: In total, 30 patients who underwent hysteroscopy between March and September 2016 at the University of Health Sciences Fatih Sultan Mehmet Health Research and Application Center, Ankara, Turkey were included in this prospective study. Standard hemodynamic monitoring, ANI, and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring were applied to the patients. At 10 min prior to induction, 1 μg/kg of remifentanil was applied in Group R (n=15) and 1 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine was applied in Group D (n=15). After induction, sevoflurane was used for maintenance with dexmedetomidine at 0.2-0.7 μg/kg/hour in Group D and remifentanil at 0.05-0.5 μg/kg/minute in Group R. Perioperative and postoperative analgesia levels (ANI and VAS, respectively), hemodynamics, and complications were recorded. Results: Even though the ANI levels in Group D were lower at the perioperative 5th and 10th minutes, the ANI values were between the targeted limits, except for the measurement after I-gel insertion, in both groups. Hemodynamic parameters were within normal limits, but the mean arterial pressures in Group R after induction, following I-gel placement, and at the perioperative 5th, 10th, and 20th minutes were lower and at postoperative 30th minute were significantly higher. Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine and remifentanil are both efficacious agents for perioperative analgesia in hysteroscopy cases.

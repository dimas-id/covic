We report a case of giant mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the pancreas that was successfully treated with laparoscopic surgery. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of an abdominal tumor that had been detected during a routine medical examination. The tumor was diagnosed as an MCN of the pancreas. We performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient could begin oral feeding 3 days after the operation. No complications occurred either during or after surgery. The outcome in this patient was excellent, with cosmetically acceptable small scars in the skin. Therefore, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy may become a therapeutic option for patients with large MCNs of the pancreas.

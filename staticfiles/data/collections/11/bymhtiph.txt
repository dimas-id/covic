Accurate interdiffusion coefficients of composition and temperature dependence are significantly important for understanding different materials processes. However, the high-throughput determination of high-quality interdiffusion coefficients, especially in multicomponent systems, has been sustaining as a challenge in materials community. This review dealt with a comprehensive summarization of the recent progress in this field, aiming at advancing a scientific routine for realizing the high-throughput determination of high-quality interdiffusion coefficients in metallic solids. First, an introduction of traditional Matano-based approaches and their recent development was given. Second, the numerical inverse methods were described, with a focus on the recently developed pragmatic numerical inverse method and related public toolkits. Potential strategies for resolving the problems about accuracy and uniqueness of the solutions to the numerical inverse methods were highlighted. The combination of numerical inverse method and diffusion multiple technique was highly proposed for high-throughput determination of interdiffusion coefficients in metallic solids with any number of components. After that, the case studies on the high-throughput determination of interdiffusivity matrices in the real Ni-based, high-entropy/high-entropy superalloys were demonstrated. Discussion on the substitution of Re in Ni-based single-crystal superalloys and the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy/high-entropy superalloys was also carried out. Fourth, the general idea for the uncertainty quantification was proposed in order to obtain high-quality interdiffusion coefficients, followed by the introduction of recent progress on the uncertainty quantification in both Matano-based methods and numerical inverse methods. Finally, the conclusions were drawn, and the future trends in diffusion community were also pointed out.

SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing an outbreak of COVID-19 globally in the past six months. A relatively higher divergence on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across species efficiently. We particularly believe that the adaptive mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be essential to its high transmissibility among humans. Thus here we collected 2,142 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny, and also analyzed the interaction between the polymorphisms of spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus in other hosts show SARS-CoV-2 is highly possible originated from Bat-CoV (RaTG13) found in horseshoe bat and a recombination event may occur on the spike protein of Pangolin-CoV to imbue it the ability to infect humans. Moreover, compared to the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, it is more conserved in the direct-binding sites of RBD and we noticed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may under a consensus evolution to adapt to human hosts better. 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 were simulated and their stability and affinity binding to hACE2 (S19-D615) were calculated. Our analysis indicates SARS-CoV-2 could infect humans from different populations with no preference, and a higher divergence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage of this pandemic may be a good indicator that could show the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 transmitting from the natural reservoir to human beings.

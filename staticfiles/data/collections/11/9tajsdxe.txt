BACKGROUND: Maintaining blood supply is essential since blood transfusions are lifesaving in many conditions. The 2003 infectious outbreak of SARS-CoV had a negative impact on blood supply. This study aimed to measure donor attendance and blood demand in order to help find efficient ways of managing blood supply and demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and similar public emergencies in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from donor attendance, mobile blood drives and blood inventory records were retrospectively obtained for the period between 1 September 2019 and 1 May 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on donor attendance and the management of blood supply and demand in King Abdullah Hospital, Bisha, Saudi Arabia. Data were analysed using SPSSStatistics, version 25.0. Categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: After imported cases of COVID-19 were reported in Saudi Arabia, donor attendance and blood supply at blood bank-based collections showed a drop of 39.5%. On the other hand, blood demand during the same period was reduced by 21.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on donor attendance and blood supply and adversely affected blood transfusion services. Guidelines that prioritize blood transfusion should prepare at the beginning of emergencies similar to this pandemic. Close monitoring of blood needs and blood supply and appropriate response is essential for avoiding sudden blood shortage. An evidence-based emergency blood management plan and flexible regulatory policy should be ready to deal with any disaster and to respond quickly in the case of blood shortage.

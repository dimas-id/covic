As the cases of COVID-19 are flooding around the world, atypical presentations are being recognized, making the diagnosis challenging. Gastrointestinal symptoms and mild abdominal pain are common. However, severe abdominal pain associated with COVID-19 warranting surgical evaluation has been rarely described; recognizing such presentations and differentiating them from a surgical abdomen is critical to effectively and safely manage COVID-19 patients. Here we present a case of a middle-aged gentleman who developed features resembling secondary peritonitis. Eventually, he was found to have COVID-19 and was managed conservatively. In this report, we discuss his management course, and we explore pertinent relevant literature.

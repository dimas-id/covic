A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of seven antiviral drugs, zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol, in poultry muscle is reported. The antiviral drugs were extracted from the homogenized poultry muscle sample using methanol. The extract was purified using tandem solid-phase extraction combining a cation exchange cartridge and a phenylboronic acid cartridge. To prevent excessive matrix effects, the analytes were separated from the matrix constituents using a column-switch liquid chromatography system combining a reversed-phase and a Hypercarb analytical column. Detection was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry. The method was fully validated according to 2002/657/EC [1] and proved to be adequate for quantification and confirmation of zanamivir and ribavirin at 10 μg kg(−1), oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine at levels below 1.0 μg kg(−1) and for qualitative confirmatory analysis of arbidol at levels below 1 μg kg(−1).

SARS‐CoV‐2 is a new coronavirus that causes COVID‐19, a disease associated with severe pneumonia.1 Many other clinical manifestations have been associated with the disease (diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, etc.) and patients can be healthy carriers of the virus.2 Several dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID‐19 have been reported.3 Among them are numerous cases of chilblain‐like lesions (CBLL) in young patients in good general condition, often not tested, or tested negative, for the SARS‐CoV‐2.4,5 In a recent study on 375 Spanish patients with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19, these CBLL accounted for 19% of all cutaneous lesions;3 they were observed in young patients with mild systemic symptoms and seemed to appear late in the course of the disease.

Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus has triggered a global emergency because of its potential to cause life-threatening Covid-19 disease. By comparison to pauci-symptomatic virus clearance by most individuals, Covid-19 has been proposed to reflect insufficient and/or pathologically exaggerated immune responses. Here we identify a consensus peripheral blood immune signature across 63 hospital-treated Covid-19 patients who were otherwise highly heterogeneous. The core signature conspicuously blended adaptive B cell responses typical of virus infection or vaccination with discrete traits hitherto associated with sepsis, including monocyte and dendritic cell dampening, and hyperactivation and depletion of discrete T cell subsets. This blending of immuno-protective and immuno-pathogenic potentials was exemplified by near-universal CXCL10/IP10 upregulation, as occurred in SARS1 and MERS. Moreover, specific parameters including CXCL10/IP10 over-expression, T cell proliferation, and basophil and plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion correlated, often prognostically, with Covid-19 progression, collectively composing a resource to inform SARS-CoV-2 pathobiology and risk-based patient stratification.

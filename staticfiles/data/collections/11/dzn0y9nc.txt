Abstract In order to establish the prevalence of viral infections of the bovine fetus in Argentina, a serological survey for antibodies against viral agents currently affecting cattle in this country was conducted. Antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were investigated in a total of 315 fetal serum samples. Conventional techniques were used: indirect immunofluorescence (FMDV, BHV-1, BVDv and BCV), radial immunodiffusion (BLV), ELISA (BRV) and haemagglutination inhibition (PI-3). Antibodies against BHV-1, BVDV and PI-3 were detected in samples from fetuses in the second and third trimester of gestation, with a prevalence of 1·21 per cent (two of 165), 2·03 per cent (four of 197) and 5·08 per cent (nine of 177), respectively. Either antibodies or non-antibody factors able to bind to BRV and Bcv antigens were detected with a prevalence of 2·44 per cent (five of 205) and 4·54 per cent (five of 110), respectively. In addition, 14·68 per cent of non-specific inhibitors of PI-3 mediated haemagglutination were found. No seropositives against FMDV and BLV were detected.

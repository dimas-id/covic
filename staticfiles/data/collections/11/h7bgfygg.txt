Smokers are exposed to early endothelial dysfunction. This microcirculatory damage can be demonstrated by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The aim of this study was to compare microvascular reactivity by NIRS during a dynamic vascular occlusion test in healthy smokers and nonsmokers volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 men, 10 women), aged from 22 to 38 years old, were included after approval of the local Ethics Committee and divided into two groups: smokers (n = 10) and nonsmokers (n = 10). Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) was measured at the level of each individual's calves during an ischemia and reperfusion test. In addition, during the ischemia phase, the slope of decline in StO2 was determined. Therefore, for each group, we were able to deduce the speed of desaturation (ΔStO2/ischemia time). The same was applied for resaturation rates during the reperfusion phase (ΔStO2/reperfusion time). StO2 values were comparable at all experimental steps between smokers and nonsmokers. During the vascular occlusion test, rates of desaturation were the same between smokers and nonsmokers [respectively 3.7%·min(-1) (range 2.5-12.6) and 3.7%·min(-1) (range 1.8-15.1); p = 0.50]. It was the same for the rate of resaturation [smokers 30.4%·min(-1) (range 14.2-51.6) and nonsmokers 30.5%·min(-1) (range 18.6-44.5); p = 0.82]. NIRS study of microvascular reactivity during a dynamic vascular occlusion test did not reveal any difference between smokers and nonsmokers. Therefore, NIRS could not be sensitive enough to highlight endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects exposed to tobacco smoke.

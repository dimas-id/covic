Abstract Several manufacturing processes experience the interaction between and among mating surfaces under the boundary lubrication (BL) regime. Textures evolve as a result of these multi-parametric interactions where physical and chemical parameters play a significant role. This research studies texture as a dynamic process with an emphasis on physical and chemical textures during process progression. The evolution of textures under the presence of lubricating tribofilm is presented. Tribological tests were conducted using a pin-on-disc setup while laser microscopy, SEM, Raman, and FIB/TEM techniques were used for characterization. Results show that the re-organization of surface asperities dictates the formation and stabilization of surface-protective tribofilm in three distinct texture evolution regions driven by physical and chemical events.

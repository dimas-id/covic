A 66-year-old, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive woman was admitted to our hospital with oliguria, systemic edema, and rapid deterioration of renal function. Laboratory examination showed increased serum creatinine and decreased serum albumin levels, complement activity, and cryoglobulin positivity. The HCV RNA genotype was found to be 1b, and the viral load was high. Kidney biopsy examination showed type I membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with capillary deposition of IgM and C3, indicating HCV-related glomerulonephritis. After hospitalization, hemodialysis was immediately required because of uremia and oliguria. Her renal function did not improve despite corticosteroid therapy. To treat the increasing HCV load, virus removal and eradication by double-filtration plasmapheresis therapy without interferon was performed, since the patient was allergic to interferon therapy. This treatment improved renal function and allowed the withdrawal from hemodialysis. This report presents a case of successful VRAD without interferon therapy in a patient with HCV-related glomerulonephritis and acute kidney injury that required hemodialysis.

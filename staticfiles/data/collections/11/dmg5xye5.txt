Abstract Nucleic acid amplification techniques have revolutionised diagnostic and research industries. Current technologies that allow the detection of amplification in real-time are fast becoming industry standards, particularly in a diagnostic context. In this review, we describe and explore the application of numerous real-time detection chemistries and amplification techniques for pathogen detection and identification, including the polymerase chain reaction, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, strand displacement amplification and the ligase chain reaction. The emergence of newer technologies, such as lab-on-a-chip devices and photo-cleavable linkers, is also discussed.

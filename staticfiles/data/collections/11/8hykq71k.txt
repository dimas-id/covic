Chemical sensors have been widely used in the biomedical field. With the rapid development of microelectronics and microprocessing technology, chemical sensors have grown to be more and more miniaturized and integrated. Combined with new information processing technology, intelligent chemical sensor arrays such as e-Nose and e-Tongue have been developed. Meanwhile, microfluidic chips enable continuous monitoring of chemical substances in living organisms.

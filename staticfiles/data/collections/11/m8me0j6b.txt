Capsule endoscopy (CE) is commonly used for examining and diagnosing gastrointestinal disease, especially small bowel disease. Capsule retention is a well-known and significant complication of CE and requires surgical or endoscopic removal. Most reports described the retrieval of retained CE via laparotomy. We report a case of successful retrieval of the capsule using single incision laparoscopic surgery.

BACKGROUND Infectious intracranial aneurysms (IIAs) are rare and potentially devastating. First-line management involves intravenous antibiotics, with surgical or endovascular management reserved for cases of failed medical treatment or aneurysmal rupture. Endovascular therapy has become the primary approach for treating these small, distally located aneurysms. Liquid embolic agents are well suited for use because of their ability to fill the aneurysm and parent vessel. We present our experience in treating these aneurysms via Onyx embolization and review the literature. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the endovascular treatment of IIAs at our institution from 2010 to 2012. Eight patients with 16 IIAs ranging in size from 1 to 16 mm underwent treatment. Seven of the patients initially presented after aneurysmal rupture. Onyx was pushed until the aneurysm and parent artery were filled. Confirmation of aneurysmal occlusion was made by repeat cerebral angiography. RESULTS One symptomatic stroke occurred after embolization. Fourteen of the 16 aneurysms have been evaluated with follow-up angiography and remain occluded. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of IIAs using an endovascular approach with Onyx is safe and effective.

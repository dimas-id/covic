Inguinal hernia repair is the most common procedure performed worldwide in general surgery. Since the turn of the 21st century, the minimally invasive approach and in particular totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair has gained in popularity. The concept of the TEP approach combines the advantages of anterior tension-free mesh repair (Lichtenstein repair) and the open preperitoneal approach championed by Stoppa. TEP repair uses a prosthetic mesh significantly bigger than in open herniorrhaphy, offering a complete overlap of the myopectineal orifice. TEP repair is a challenging technique with unfamiliar anatomy, a limited operative field, and long learning curve. This article provides an experienced opinion on the practical aspects of the TEP approach. Some of these steps have already been discussed in the surgical literature, while others are the fruit of a personal expertise grasped over the years with more than 1,000 TEP repairs performed.

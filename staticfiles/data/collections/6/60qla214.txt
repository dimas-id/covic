At the end of 2019, the virus causing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China, wich has affected more than 1.5 million people worldwide. The easy transmission by aerosols and direct contact, represents a challenge for personnel who manipulate the airway of these patients. We present the case of a 33-year-old woman diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, under prolonged intubation scheduled for tracheostomy. The aim of this report is to review the anesthetic considerations during this procedure in this group of patients, in order to reduce the risk of contagion in health personnel.

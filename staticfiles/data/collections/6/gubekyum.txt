Progress in the development of protein‚Äêimmobilization strategies and methods has made protein biochips increasingly accessible. The integration of these assay and analysis platforms into biomedical and biotechnological research has substantially expanded the repertoire of methods available for proteomics and biomarker research and for drug development. This Minireview highlights selected developments in the application of protein biochips in these fields.

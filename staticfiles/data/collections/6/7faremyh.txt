ABSTRACT: Seasonal changes in distribution and abundance of euphausiids off south‐eastern Hokkaido (41°−43°N), Sanriku (38°−41°N), and Joban (36°−38°N) were investigated using cylindrical‐conical nets every two months from March 1997 to February 1998. Twenty‐six species of seven genera of euphausiids occurred during the survey. Among them, subarctic‐transitional Euphausia pacifica was the most abundant throughout the year in coastal waters, as their relative contribution to the total abundance of euphausiids was 89–92%. This species occurred in each coastal water throughout the survey and was abundant from winter to early summer (February–June) off Sanriku and Joban and in autumn in south‐eastern Hokkaido. Thysanoessa inspinata occurred off south‐eastern Hokkaido and Sanriku throughout the survey, mainly in spring (April) but rarely occurred off Joban. Three other subarctic Thysanoessa species occurred mainly off south‐eastern Hokkaido from winter to spring. Conversely, warm‐ and transitional‐water epipelagic species occurred exclusively off Sanriku and Joban in autumn. The characteristics of seasonal distributional patterns of euphausiids are discussed in relation to the spatial and temporal changes of oceanographic conditions and several predators off north‐eastern Japan.

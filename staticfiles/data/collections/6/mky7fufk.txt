Families find themselves in an exceptional situation after the sudden death of someone close. Anxiety, aggression, rage, incomprehension, and distraction are only a few feelings of the concerned people which intensive care staff must take care of. Crisis intervention, developed in the middle of the last century, offers a framework with its concepts for the healthcare staff of how to work with the bereaved people during the first few hours. The BASIS model is a sort of counseling technique that guides nurses and physicians: bonding and urging the acceptance of the facts, providing structure and information, and securing backup support networks. Professionals who offer help need a high level of empathy and compassion for their work. But it is essential to offer help only in situations where advice is possible. Otherwise, physicians and nurses are at high risk to develop compassion fatigue. The right training, advanced education, and supervision are necessary, so that healthcare professionals can support people in crisis.

Experience of application of nonsuture electrowelding technologies (NEWT) was analyzed while performing open and miniinvasive thoracoscopic operations in 116 patients. No essential differences were revealed while comparing domestic and foreign electrowelding surgical instruments. Possibility of wide application of NEWT in miniinvasive videothoracoscopic surgery was demonstrated.

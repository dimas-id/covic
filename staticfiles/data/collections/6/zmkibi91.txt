Severe restrictions have been imposed in most countries for oral health care to the general population, allowing treatment only for emergencies, because of the generation of aerosols during clinical procedures and to ration personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. This article stresses the critical situation that affects oral health for older persons in the complex times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults are at high risk for the viral infection, but neglected dental conditions may worsen their health, triggering infections that can lead to local and systemic complications, compromising general health. We propose that under current and possibly future scenarios, teledentistry and the minimal intervention dentistry approach may play a pivotal role in reshaping the profession. The already existent inequities in oral health care may be exacerbated due to the pandemic, especially in the developing world. More research along with a strong educational component in the dental curriculum must be emphasized. COVID-19 may be an opportunity to change canonical paradigms. The dental profession must reflect and take action to face future challenges. Knowledge Transfer Statement: This article provides an overview of the oral health situation imposed by COVID-19 and the minimal intervention alternatives to provide care to older people who are at risk and have reduced access to care.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, surgical education has increased its focus on the non-technical skills such as communication and interpersonal relationships while continuing to strive for technical excellence of procedures and patient care. An awareness of the ethical aspects of surgical practice that involve non-technical skills and judgment is of vital concern to surgical educators and encompasses disparate issues ranging from adequate supervision of trainees to surgical care access. METHODS: This bibliographical research effort seeks to report on ethical challenges from a sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) perspective as found in the peer-reviewed literature employing African Journals Online, Bioline, and other sources with African information as well as PubMed and PubMed Central. The principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice offer a framework for a study of issues including: access to care (socioeconomic issues and distance from health facilities); resource utilization and decision making based on availability and cost of resources, including ICU and terminal extubation; informed consent (both communication about reasonable expectations post-procedure and research participation); research ethics, including local projects and international collaboration; quality and safety including supervision of less experienced professionals; and those religious and cultural issues that may affect any ethical decision making. The religious and cultural environment receives attention because beliefs and traditions affect medical choices ranging from acceptance of procedures, amputations, to end-of-life decisions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Ethics awareness and ethics education should be a vital component of non-technical skills training in surgical education and medical practice in SSA for trainees. Continuing professional development of faculty should include an awareness of ethical issues.

OBJECTIVES With the advent of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, there has been a general underuse of right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left because of concerns regarding higher complication rates and poorer outcomes. We performed a retrospective analysis of our laparoscopic donor nephrectomy series with an emphasis on the side of the kidney retrieved and the outcomes of donors and recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data on 94 consecutive donor-recipient pairs (188 patients) were reviewed. All donor nephrectomies were performed by pure laparoscopy. There were 74 left laparoscopic donor nephrectomies and 20 right laparoscopic donor nephrectomies. Intraoperative parameters and graft outcome were recorded and the data were analyzed to compare right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy using a computer software system. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 3.4 y). RESULTS There were no significant differences in any intraoperative or postoperative parameters, except in a slightly higher warm ischemia time in right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, but this did not translate into an adverse effect on renal recovery. Acute graft rejection was observed in 2 of 74 patients who had a left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (2.7%) and none of the patients who had a right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Chronic graft loss was observed in 2 of 74 patients who had a left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (2.7%); 1 of recurrent pyelonephritis and sepsis and 1 renal oxalosis. No graft losses were observed in any patient who had a right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Mean serum creatinine levels in recipients at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were equivalent for right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy; they were 120, 110, 110, 110, 110 µmol/L, versus 110, 110, 110, 110, 110 µmol/L. (1.35, 1.21, 1.24, 1.21, 1.26 mg/dL versus 1.22, 1.17, 1.17, 1.17, 1.23 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS This single center study demonstrates equivalent results with left laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with no adverse effects of right laparoscopic donor nephrectomy on donor-recipient outcome or renal function.

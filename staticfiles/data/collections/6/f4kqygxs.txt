Ethylene glycol (EG) is a well known toxic compound, the assumption of which can be fatal to pet animals as well as to humans. Limited information is available on the pathological features of EG poisoning in pet animals, with special emphasis on cats. Twenty-five cats with histologically confirmed EG intoxication were retrospectively investigated, in order to define more precisely the gross pathological findings and improve the diagnostic process. Furthermore, a brief comparison with the lesions reported in EG-poisoned human patients and dogs was also made.

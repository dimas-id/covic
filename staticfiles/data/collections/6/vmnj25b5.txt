A total of 332 fecal specimens collected during January-December 2008 from adult patients with diarrhea were screened for group A and C rotaviruses, noroviruses GI and GII, sapovirus, Aichi virus, human parechovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus by RT-multiplex PCR. The detection rate for diarrheal viruses was 4.2 %. Adenovirus and enterovirus were equally detected as the most predominant viruses, with prevalence of 1.2 %, followed by Aichi virus (0.9 %) and norovirus GII (0.6 %). Mixed infection with norovirus GII and human parechovirus was also detected (0.3 %). This study provides epidemiological data for a wide variety of diarrheal viruses circulating in adult patients with diarrhea in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

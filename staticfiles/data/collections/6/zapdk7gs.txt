The coronavirus disease 2019 SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously affected care for all urgent diseases, as well as the follow-up of patients with chronic diseases. Once the peak of the pandemic has been overcome, we must restart care for our patients, sometimes with substantial changes in the type of care we previously provided. From the Section on Cardiac Pacing of the Spanish Society of Cardiology we propose a working scheme to ensure effective and also safe care for both patients and professionals. Surgical interventions should be performed, if possible, after a test or the completion of a checklist to determine the patient's risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. As for follow-up, we are strongly committed to an organization focused on an organized remote monitoring program.

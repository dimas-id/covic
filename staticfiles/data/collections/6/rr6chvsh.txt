Using fusions between the Escherichia coli genes argI and lacZ, it has been demonstrated that ribosomal frameshifting occurs at a frequency of between 3% and 16% within the argl mRNA, soon after the initiation codon. The frameshift involves a phenylalanyl-tRNA shifting into the + 1 frame at the sequence UUU-U/C. The shift does not occur if the in-frame phenylalanine codon UUU is replaced by UUC. The level of frameshifting is higher in dense cultures and is not dependent on phenylalanine starvation. In the wild-type argI gene this frameshifting event would be an error, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein. Therefore, it is unlike the numerous examples of required frameshifting events that have been described in other genes.

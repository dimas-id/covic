ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has impacted nearly every aspect of our lives. It has certainly changed how we deliver health care. In part, it has accelerated the development/use of technology solutions in health care. These technology tools were originally identified as mechanisms that would make future care “easier or better”, however, these tech solutions amidst COVID-19 are now viewed as “essential”. The use of technology discussed in this article has been accelerated during the current crisis because they provide distance, safety for healthcare professionals and patients, faster results reporting, virtual visits, and more. As we move forward, technology will continue to be positioned to best address public health needs, improve care efficiencies as well as develop treatments and vaccines. Specifically, this article explores the adoption and growth of technology tools including; telehealth, artificial intelligence, and robotics over the first 90 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

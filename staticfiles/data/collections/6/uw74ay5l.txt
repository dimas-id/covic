Microbial nomenclature underwent a large number of changes in the 1970s. Many species of pathogens were added and many others experienced name changes. These modifications primarily were due to two unrelated factors: the use of new DNA hybridization techniques and the advent of computerized literature searches to establish historical precedence. In 1980 an approved list of microbial names was published. This list fixed and legitimized bacterial nomenclature. All future additions or alterations to it had to pass international scientific committees. This list has now been accepted by the scientific community. The derivation of these names are presented in this review.

PURPOSE There is limited literature regarding the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic procedures in patients having mechanical circulatory support, especially colonic resections. METHODS The aim of this study is to present the case of a laparoscopic colectomy for cancer undergone in a 69-year-old patient having a HeartWare II at our institution without any postoperative major complications and to describe the perioperative management and outcome of these patients according to the literature, regarding the hemodynamic, hemorrhagic, and infectious risks and the safety of this procedure. RESULTS There was no 90-day postoperative morbidity or death. A total of six patients including ours were identified in the study. This study has a limited number of patients and relatively short follow-up time. CONCLUSION Even though the management of patients having a LVAD is challenging and needs a multidisciplinary approach, reported literatures have shown the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic interventions for colorectal surgeries.

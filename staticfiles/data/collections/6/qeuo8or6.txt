In the era of big data, the establishment of a free database, containing all the immune drug targets and associated cell types, is of great value. To this aim, the Guide to Immunopharmacology has been created in a joint effort between the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS). Here we highlight the structure and content of the database, which includes up‐to‐date quantitative information on the fundamental science underlying each immune target. A set of practical examples and tools for data mining are summarized to support immune research into drug discovery and therapeutics.

In the previous literature, the symptoms cases of CTS were gradually increased. PATIENT CONCERNS We report a 44-year-old male porter presented with mass on his left distal forearm combined a repeated carpal tunnel syndrome for 5 years. He felt numbness in fingers and his left palmar. The CTS symptoms had been eased through rest and dugs medication. It recurred twice. DIAGNOSES Monosodium urate crystal deposits were found in surgery. Histologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of gout. INTERVENTIONS We removed partial of gouty tophus and retained the integrity of the tendon. OUTCOMES Two years after the surgery, the patient had not experienced any symptom recurrence.

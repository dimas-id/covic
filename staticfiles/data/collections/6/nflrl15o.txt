The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. Since then, the virus has spread to affect more countries worldwide. During this period, our nuclear medicine department at Singapore General Hospital segregated our staff and patients by time, by space, or both, to minimize contact and prevent spread of the virus. Necessary changes to our clinical practices and stricter infection control measures were also enforced. We share our personal experience in managing a nuclear medicine department during this epidemic.

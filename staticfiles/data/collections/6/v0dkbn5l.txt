Summary Objectives To investigate 2 positive impacts (better family/social support and lifestyle changes) and their associations with other negative impacts. Study design and participants A telephone survey using random telephone numbers and a structured questionnaire was conducted in Hong Kong general population. Eight hundred and eighteen Hong Kong residents of age 18–60 years completed the interview (response rate: 65%) at around end of June 2003, the early ending phase of the epidemic. Results Over 60% of the respondents stated that they cared more about the family members' feelings; about 30%–40% stated that they found their friends, their family members more supportive or having more sharing with others when not feeling happy; only a few percent felt the opposite. Further, about 2/3 of the respondents paid more attention to their mental health. About 35%–40% took more time to rest, for relaxation or doing exercise. These items were, in general, negatively associated with post-traumatic stress, perception of stress and other perceptions that were related to SARS. Conclusions SARS have brought some positive impacts on social/family support, mental health awareness and lifestyle changes. These positive impacts were associated with other relevant negative impacts and might be important cushions of the negative impact.

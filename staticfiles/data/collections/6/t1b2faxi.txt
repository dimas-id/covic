Objective: To investigate the clinical features and outcome of treatment for novel coronavirus pneumonia. Methods: Literature on novel coronavirus pneumonia was retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE databases. The relevant data was extracted and a meta-analysis was performed using StatsDirect statistical software V.2.8.0 to calculate the combined odds ratio. Results: Seven studies were included, consisting of 1594 cases. The meta-analysis result showed that the most common clinical symptoms of the novel coronavirus pneumonia were fever (91.6%) and cough (64.5%), followed by dyspnea (32.8%) and sputum (28.1%). Headache (10.5%), sore throat (11.2%), hemoptysis (3.2%), diarrhea (6.6%) and the other symptoms were relatively rare. Aspartate aminotransferase (29%), alanine transaminase (22.7%), and total bilirubin (11.7%) levels were elevated, except for serum albumin levels (80.4%). The common therapeutic agents used were antibiotics (87.7%), antiviral drugs (75.5%), and glucocorticoids (26.6%), while antifungal agents (7.7%) were used in few. Mechanical ventilation (13.4%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (1.9%), and continuous renal replacement therapy (3.8%) were used in severe cases. The rate of mortality in hospital was 7.7%, respectively. Heterogeneity between studies was significant; however, subgroup and sensitivity analysis had failed to identify clear sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: Fever, cough and liver dysfunction are the main clinical manifestations of this disease and the mortality rate is low.

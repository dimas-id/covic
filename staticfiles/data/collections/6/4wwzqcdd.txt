Management of the neurogenic bladder with an incontinent stoma is necessary in situations in which intermittent catheterization via the urethra or a continent stoma is not feasible. Cutaneous ureterostomy, vesicostomy, ileal conduit, and ileovesicostomy have all been used for this purpose. Vesicostomy is most commonly used as a temporizing measure in the pediatric neurogenic population. Both ileal conduit, with or without cystectomy, and ileovesicostomy have contemporary roles in the management of the neurogenic bladder.

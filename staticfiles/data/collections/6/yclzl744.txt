OBJECTIVE The aim of this field study was to explore the occurrence of and factors associated with the detection of swine influenza virus (SIV) by RTqPCR in weaner pigs and sows from herds with a history of respiratory or reproductive disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample set was based on nasal swabs from 823 sows (123 submissions) and 562 weaner pigs (80 submissions). Nasal swab samples were taken and submitted by 51 veterinary practices from all over Germany. Corresponding to the pig density most of the submissions originated from the north-western part of Germany. The nasal swabs were used to detect SIV RNA by real-time RT-PCR (RTqPCR). Subtyping of SIV RNA by conventional RT-PCR and sequencing was attempted directly from clinical samples or from isolates when available. The herd characteristics, management and housing conditions of the pig herd as well as the course of the disease were collected by a telephone questionnaire with the herd attending veterinarian. RESULTS SIV was detected by RTqPCR in 53.8% of the submissions from weaner pigs with a history of respiratory disease. Moreover SIV was detected in 10.6% of the submissions from sows. The predominant endemic subtype found in nasal swabs from sows and weaner pigs was H1N1 (60.5%) whereas subtypes H1N2 (14.0%) and H3N2 (14.0%) were detected less frequently. In addition, human pandemic H1N1 virus or reassortants thereof were found in 11.5%. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The results underline the significance of a SIV infection in young pigs. A significant lower detection of SIV in wea- ner pigs was associated with the vaccination of piglets against por- cine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), possibly indicating an interaction of SIV and PCV2. Most of the positive samples from sows originated from gilts, whereas only two originated from sows. An association between reproductive disorders and the detection of SIV could not be confirmed.

An efficient mechanism for the sequence‐specific inhibition of gene expression is RNA interference. In this process, double‐stranded RNA molecules induce cleavage of a selected target RNA (see picture). This technique has in recent years developed into a standard method of molecular biology. Successful applications in animal models have already led to the initiation of RNAi‐based clinical trials as a new therapeutic option.[Image: see text] Only ten years ago Andrew Fire and Craig Mello were able to show that double‐stranded RNA molecules could inhibit the expression of homologous genes in eukaryotes. This process, termed RNA interference, has developed into a standard method of molecular biology. This Review provides an overview of the molecular processes involved, with a particular focus on the posttranscriptional inhibition of gene expression in mammalian cells, the possible applications in research, and the results of the first clinical studies.

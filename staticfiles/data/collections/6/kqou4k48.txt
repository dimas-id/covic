Two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59, ts43 and ts379, have been described previously to be ts in infectivity but unaffected in RNA synthesis (M. J. M. Koolen, A. D. M. E. Osterhaus, G. van Steenis, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, Virology 125:393-402, 1983). We present a detailed analysis of the protein synthesis of the mutant viruses at the permissive (31 degrees C) and nonpermissive (39.5 degrees C) temperatures. It was found that synthesis of the nucleocapsid protein N and the membrane protein M of both viruses was insensitive to temperature. However, the surface protein S of both viruses was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum at the nonpermissive temperature. This was shown first by analysis of endoglycosidase H-treated and immunoprecipitated labeled S proteins. The mature Golgi form of S was not present at the nonpermissive temperature for the ts viruses, in contrast to wild-type (wt) virus. Second, gradient purification of immunoprecipitated S after pulse-chase labeling showed that only wt virus S was oligomerized. We conclude that the lack of oligomerization causes the retention of the ts S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, ts virus particles that were devoid of S were produced at the nonpermissive temperature. This result could be confirmed by biochemical analysis of purified virus particles and by electron microscopy.

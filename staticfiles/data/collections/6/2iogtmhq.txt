The gracilis free flap is the ideal modality of emotive and spontaneous facial reanimation in patients with a viable contralateral facial nerve. A 2-stage procedure with a cross-face nerve graft followed by gracilis free flap inset is advocated. In this article, the anatomy of the gracilis muscle, alternative neural sources (including the masseteric nerve), and technical aspects of the procedure are discussed. The literature regarding outcomes and complications is reviewed.

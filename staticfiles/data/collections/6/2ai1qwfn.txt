Next-generation sequencing has the ability to revolutionize almost all fields of biological science. It has drastically reduced the cost of sequencing. This allows us to study the whole genome or part of the genome to understand how the cellular functions are governed by the genetic code. The data obtained in huge quantity from sequencing upon analysis gives an insight to understand the mechanism of pathogen biology, virulence, and phenomenon of bacterial resistance, which helps in investigating the outbreak. This ultimately helps in the development of therapies for public health welfare against human pathogen and diagnostic reagents for the screening. This chapter includes the basic of Sangerâ€™s method of DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing, different available platforms for sequencing with their advantages, and limitations and their chemistry with an overview of downstream data analysis. Furthermore, the breadth of applications of high-throughput NGS technology for human health has been discussed.

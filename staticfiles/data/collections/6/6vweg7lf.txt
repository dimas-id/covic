Increasing the efficiency of parallel software development is one of the key obstacles in taking advantage of heterogeneous multi-core architectures. Efficient and reliable compiler technology is required to identify the trade-off between multiple design goals at once. The most crucial objectives are application performance and processor power consumption. Including memory power into this multi-objective optimisation problem is of utmost importance. Therefore, this paper proposes the heuristic MORAM solving this three-dimensional Pareto front calculation. Furthermore, it is integrated into a commercially available framework to conduct a detailed evaluation and applicability study. MORAM is assessed with representative benchmarks on two different platforms and contrasted with a state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithm. On average, MORAM produces 6% better Pareto fronts, while it is at least [Formula: see text] faster.

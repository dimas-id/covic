The cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus has a large impact on cattle production due to its bloodsucking habit and transmission of pathogens that cause babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Application of acaricides constitutes the major control method but is often accompanied by serious drawbacks, including environmental contamination and an increase in acaricide resistance by ticks. The recent development of anti-tick vaccines has provided positive results in the post-genomic era, owing to the rise of reverse vaccinological and bioinformatics approaches to analyze and identify candidate protective antigens for use against ticks. The ATAQ protein is considered a novel antigen for the control of the cattle tick R. microplus; it is expressed in midguts and Malpighian tubules of all ticks from the Rhipicephalus genus. However, genetic diversity studies are required. Here, the ATAQ gene was sequenced of seven R. microplus tick isolates from different regions in Mexico to understand the genetic diversity. The results showed that sequence identity among the Mexican isolates ranged between 98 and 100% and 97.8–100% at the nucleotide and protein levels, respectively. Alignments of deduced amino acid sequences from different R. microplus ATAQ isolates in Mexico revealed a high degree of conservation. However, the Mexican isolates differed from the R. microplus “Mozambique” strain, at 20 amino acid residues. Finally, the analysis of more R. microplus isolates, and possibly of other Rhipicephalus species, to determine the genetic diversity in the ATAQ locus is essential to suggest this antigen as a vaccine candidate that might control tick infestations.

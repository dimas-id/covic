Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has rapidly become epidemic in Italy and other European countries. The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic presentations to acute respiratory failure. At the present time the absolute number of severe cases requiring ventilator support is reaching or even surpassing the intensive care unit bed capacity in the most affected regions and countries. Objectives To narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19, in the attempt to combine current evidence and frontline opinions and provide balanced answers to pressing clinical questions. Sources Inductive PubMed search for publications relevant to the topic. Content The available literature and the authorsâ€™ frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, plus a conclusive statement for each answer. Implications Many off-label antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being administered to patients with COVID-19. Physicians must be aware that, being not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled in randomized clinical trials (RCT). Access to well-designed RCT should be expanded as much as possible, being the most secure way to change for the better our approach to COVID-19 patients.

Background Thyroid nodules are very common in general population. Even if benign, they may require a treatment in case of symptoms or cosmetic concerns. In the last years, minimally invasive treatments alternative to surgery have been developed, in particular ultrasound (US) guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods Twenty-four patients (9 males; 15 females; mean age 57.9 years) were treated and divided in two groups (A and B) according to the RFA needle used (18 gauge needle, AMICA; 17 gauge needle, COVIDIEN). Nodules and patients characteristics, together with procedural data were registered pre-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. US visibility of the needle, volume of the nodules, symptoms and cosmetic concerns, complications were registered. Results Visibility of the needle was not significantly different in the two groups (P=0.0787). At 1 month the mean volume of the nodules dropped from 37.1 to 25 mL in group A and from 23.2 to 15.4 mL in group B; shrinkage rate (36.9% and 39.5%, respectively) was not significantly different (P=0.3137). Symptoms decreased from 3.1 to 1.4 in group A and from 4 to 1.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.3305). Cosmetic score decreased from 3.7 to 3.4 in group A and from 3.9 to 3.6 in group B: no significant differences in reductions were observed (P=0.96). Total complication rate (18.2% in group A vs. 23.1% in group B) did not showed significant differences (P=0.5049). Conclusions The two systems used in our study resulted equivalent in terms of US needle visibility, efficacy, symptom/cosmetic relief, safety. More patients and a longer follow-up are necessary to confirm our results.

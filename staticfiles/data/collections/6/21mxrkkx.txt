A 43-year-old Japanese woman with melena underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and was preoperatively diagnosed with sarcoma of the stomach. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Findings on the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a pedunculated submucosal tumor measuring 17 mm in the antrum. An enhanced computed tomography showed wall thickening in the gastric antrum. The patient underwent a laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) for wedge resection of the stomach. The excised tumor measured 27 × 20 × 15 mm in size. Histopathology showed spindle-shaped cells in the submucosal layer. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor was positive for CD34, bcl-2, and MIC-2. The final diagnosis was solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the stomach. The postoperative course was uneventful, and no evidence of recurrence was observed at the 8-month follow-up. We report a case of SFT arising from the stomach that was treated with wedge resection by LECS.

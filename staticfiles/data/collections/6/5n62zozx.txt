OBJECTIVE The DERIVO embolization device (DED) is a new nitinol flow diverter stent manufactured for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of the DED in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms and present the short- and midterm results. METHODS We treated 34 aneurysms using 26 devices in 24 patients with wide-necked, mostly medium-sized, and fusiform aneurysms. Fourteen of the patients included in the study were women and the other 10 were men. Headache was the most frequent symptom. Although 31 (91.2%) aneurysms were in the anterior circulation, 3 (8.8%) were in the posterior. Intracranial stent medication was accomplished in all patients. All patients were evaluated 1 day later for any ischemic lesion with diffusion-weighted imaging. The first and second follow-up angiograms were planned to be performed after 3 and 9 months. RESULTS In all patients, the treatment was successful. No hemorrhagic complication was seen on computed tomography scan performed immediately after the procedure. All patients were discharged without any neurologic deficit. Although 20 (71.4%) of 28 aneurysms in 20 patients were totally closed on the 3-month follow-up angiogram, 14 (77.8%) of 18 aneurysms in 9 patients were totally closed on the 9-month follow-up. General morbidity was 8.4%, and mortality was 4.3%. CONCLUSIONS The DED seems effective and safe in the treatment of different kinds of intracranial aneurysms.

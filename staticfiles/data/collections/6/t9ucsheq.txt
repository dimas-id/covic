Abstract One hypothesis for the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders proposes that viral infection contributes to the induction of neuronal system dysfunction, resulting in a wide range of behavioral abnormalities. Recent research in molecular biology supports this hypothesis and refocuses on the role of viral infection in the development of psychiatric disorders. Viral infection can induce deleterious effects in the central nervous system by direct and/or indirect pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction caused by persistent viral infection should lead to novel insights into the development of neurobehavioral disorders, including human mental illnesses, and to the possible development of treatments.

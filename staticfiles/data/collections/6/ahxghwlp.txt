Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 among children and youth in Canada will help to inform public health measures in settings where children gather. As of April 27, 2020, provinces and territories provided the Public Health Agency of Canada with detailed information on 24,079 cases, of which 3.9% (n=938) were younger than 20 years of age. The detection rate per 100,000 population was lower in this age group (11.9 per 100,000), compared with those aged 20-59 years (72.4 per 100,000) and 60 and older (113.6 per 100,000). The median age among those younger than 20 years of age was 13 years, and cases were distributed equally across male and female genders. Among provinces and territories with more than 100 cases, 1.6% to 9.8% of cases were younger than 20 years of age. Cases in this age group were more likely to be asymptomatic: 10.7% compared with 2.4% in those aged 20-59 years and 4.1% in those aged 60 and older. Children and youth experienced severe outcomes less often, but 2.2% (n=15/672) of cases within this age group were severe enough to require hospitalization. Based on available exposure information, 11.3% (n=59/520) of cases aged younger than 20 years had no known contact with a case. Canadian findings align with those of other countries.

Abstract Darkling beetle homogenates (DBH) were prepared from beetles collected from seven premises (farms). DBH were shown to contain myriad infectious organisms including bacteria (e.g., Salmonella), viruses (e.g., reovirus), and Eimeria (the causative agents of intestinal coccidiosis). The present study establishes the fact that darkling beetles serve as vectors for common avian pathogens. Darkling beetles must be considered on a list of other vectors known to transmit common poultry pathogens. The risk posed by beetles with respect to dissemination of diseases is of immense importance to the poultry industry. The possibility of severe adverse economic impact as a result of these diseases should not be overlooked or casually dismissed.

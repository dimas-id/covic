OBJECTIVE: To design a low cost ($40), realistic and fluoroscopy-free percutaneous Kirschner wire hand fracture fixation training instrument kit for home-based skill acquisition during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A 3D-printed hand was designed from a computed tomography scan of a healthy hand. These data were used to create replaceable hand and wrist bones and reusable silicone molds for a replica of the soft tissue envelope. The model is currently being integrated into the simulation curriculum at 2 integrated plastic surgery residency programs for training in percutaneous wire fixation of hand fractures. SETTING: Brown University, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Large academic quaternary referral institution. Yale University, Yale School of Medicine. Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Large academic quaternary referral institution. PARTICIPANTS: PGY 1-4 plastic surgery residents preparing to meet ACGME Accreditation for Graduate Medical Education hand surgery specific milestones. RESULTS: A realistic and durable 3D model with interchangeable bones allows trainees to practice the key motor skills necessary for successful fixation of hand and wrist fractures with K-wires in a home-based setting. CONCLUSIONS: A low cost, realistic and durable 3D hand model with interchangeable bones allows easy integration into any home-based hand surgery curriculum. With 3D printers and programming becoming more prevalent and affordable, such models offer a means of low-cost and safe instruction of residents in fracture fixation with no harm to patients.

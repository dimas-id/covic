In order to develop autologous tissue engineering of the whole wall in the urinary excretory system, we studied the regenerative capacity of the muscular bladder wall. Smooth muscle cell expansion on minced detrusor muscle in vitro and in vivo with or without urothelial tissue was studied. Porcine minced detrusor muscle and urothelium were cultured in vitro under standard culture conditions for evaluation of the explant technique and in collagen for tissue sectioning and histology. Autografts of minced detrusor muscle with or without minced urothelium were expanded on 3D cylinder moulds by grafting into the subcutaneous fat of the pig abdominal wall. Moulds without autografts were used as controls. Tissue harvesting, mincing, and transplantation were performed as a one-step procedure. Cells from minced detrusor muscle specimens migrated and expanded in vitro on culture plastic and in collagen. In vivo studies with minced detrusor autografts demonstrated expansion and regeneration in all specimens. Minced urothelium autografts showed multilayered transitional urothelium when transplanted alone but not in cotransplantation with detrusor muscle; thus, minced bladder mucosa was not favored by cografting with minced detrusor. No regeneration of smooth muscle or epithelium was seen in controls.

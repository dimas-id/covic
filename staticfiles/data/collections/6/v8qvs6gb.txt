A longitudinal clinical and microbiologic surveillance was conducted from October to May, 1971â€“1972, on 16 children with infectious asthma and 15 of their nonasthmatic siblings. Asthmaticchildren experienced a significantly greater frequency of viral respiratory infections than did nonasthmatic ones (5.1 vs. 3.8 per subject). This increased incidence appeared to be largely the result of a greater number of rhinovirus infections. While respiratory infections of identical etiology that occurred concurrently in an asthmatic and his sibling were equivalent in severity, illnesses were longer (but not significantly so) in asthmatic children.

Abstract Micro-transfer printing is a powerful methodology for the manufacturing of 3D heterogeneously integrated micro-systems. This paper explores an active elastomeric composite dense array stamp which improves throughput while enabling local monitoring and control of the process. This dense array stamp is a scalable 4x4 geometry design with a multiplexed interconnection scheme, ensuring a small footprint. It consists of 16 individual stamps, each with a Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) actuator and a strain gauge sensor. Actuation and sensing characterization and closed-loop feedback control were established, and the dense array stamp performance was validated using selective pickup and place micro-transfer printing experiments.

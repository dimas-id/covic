Knowledge Graphs (KGs) that publish RDF data modelled using ontologies in a wide range of domains have populated the Web. The SHACL language is a W3C recommendation that has been endowed to encode a set of either value or model data restrictions that aim at validating KG data, ensuring data quality. Developing shapes is a complex and time consuming task that is not feasible to achieve manually. This article presents two resources that aim at generating automatically SHACL shapes for a set of ontologies: (1) Astrea-KG, a KG that publishes a set of mappings that encode the equivalent conceptual restrictions among ontology constraint patterns and SHACL constraint patterns, and (2) Astrea, a tool that automatically generates SHACL shapes from a set of ontologies by executing the mappings from the Astrea-KG. These two resources are openly available at Zenodo, GitHub, and a web application. In contrast to other proposals, these resources cover a large number of SHACL restrictions producing both value and model data restrictions, whereas other proposals consider only a limited number of restrictions or focus only on value or model restrictions.

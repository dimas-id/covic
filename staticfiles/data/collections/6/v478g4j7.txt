BACKGROUND Dynamic chest radiography (DCR) is a flat-panel detector (FPD)-based functional X-ray imaging, which is performed as an additional examination in chest radiography. DCR provides objective and quantifiable information, such as diaphragm movement, pulmonary ventilation and circulation, and is reasonable for detecting tumor invasion or adhesion. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of Solitary Fibrous Tumor of Pleura (SFTP), preoperatively predicted visceral pleura origin using Dynamic chest radiography (DCR) and surgically resected through single-access (uniportal) video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UVATS). CONCLUSIONS UVATS may be a suitable surgical option for pedunculated SFTPs. Dynamic chest radiography provides information, such as tumor invasion or adhesion and helpful for predicting origin of the tumor.

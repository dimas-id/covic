OBJECTIVE Thromboembolism is the one of the most serious complications that can occur during endovascular coil embolization of cerebral aneurysm. We report on the effectiveness and safety of intra-arterial/intravenous (IA/IV) glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (tirofiban) infusion for treating thromboembolism during endovascular coil embolization of cerebral aneurysm. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 242 patients with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysms (n=264) who underwent endovascular coil embolization from January 2011 to June 2014. Thromboembolism occurred in 20 patients (7.4%), including 14 cases of ruptured aneurysms and 6 cases of unruptured aneurysms. The most common site of aneurysms was the anterior communicating artery (n=8), followed by middle cerebral artery (n=6). When we found an enlarged thromboembolism during coil embolization, we tried to dissolve it using tirofiban administered via IA and IV loading (5 μg/kg, respectively) for 3-5 minutes followed by IV maintenance (0.08 μg/kg/min) for approximately 4-24 hours. RESULTS In 4 of 5 patients with total vessel occlusion, the vessel was recanalized to Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Perfusion Scale (TICI) grade 3, and in 1 patient to TICI grade 2a. In 2 patients with partial vessel occlusion and 13 patients with minimal occlusion, the vessel recanalized to TICI grade 3. Irrelevant intracerebral hemorrhage was noted in 1 patient (5%), and thromboemboli-related cerebral infarction developed in 5 patients (25%), of which only 1 (5%) was symptomatic. CONCLUSION IA/IV infusion and IV maintenance with tirofiban appear to be an effective rescue treatment for thromboembolism during endovascular coil embolization in patients with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysms.

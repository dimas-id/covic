Chronic and infectious diseases, including health care-associated infections and tropical diseases, represent a large portion of the global health burden. Solutions need to be found while addressing other health priorities identified by the Millennium Development Goals. A number of organizations and initiatives have been created to meet this need. Developing countries in Latin America and several African countries are taking a larger role in the development of robust health systems, capacity building, and education. Integrated, efficient, and equitable health systems that incorporate primary, secondary, and tertiary care models with a research focus are critically needed to fill this void.

We have previously demonstrated molecular mimicry between the S peplomer protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and Fc gamma R (Fc gamma R). A monoclonal antibody (MAb) to mouse Fc gamma R (2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R MAb), purified rabbit immunoglobulin, but not their F(ab')2 fragments, as well as mouse and rat IgG, immunoprecipitated (1) recombinant S peplomer protein expressed by a vaccinia virus recombinant in human, rabbit, and mouse cells, and (2) natural S peplomer protein from cells infected with several strains of MHV and MHV escaped mutants. We report here results of studies documenting molecular mimicry between Fc gamma R and S peplomer protein of viruses representing three distinct antigenic subgroups of the Coronaviridae. We have shown a molecular mimicry between the S peplomer protein of bovine corona virus (BCV) and Fc gamma R. The 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R MAb, rabbit IgG, but not its F(ab')2 fragments, as well as homologous bovine serum, free of anti-BCV antibodies, immunoprecipitated S peplomer protein of BCV (Mebus strain). In contrast, we did not find molecular mimicry between S peplomer protein of human corona virus (HCV-OC43) and Fc gamma R. Although the OC43 virus belongs to the same antigenic group as MHV and BCV, MAb specific for human Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII and purified human IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 myeloma proteins did not immunoprecipitate the S peplomer protein from HCV-OC43-infected RD cells. In addition, we did demonstrate molecular mimicry between the S peplomer protein of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Fc gamma R. TGEV belongs to the second antigenic subgroup of coronaviridae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

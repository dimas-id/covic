BACKGROUND To deal with pandemics, evaluating the temporal status of an outbreak is important. However, prevailing standards in this respect are mostly empirical and arbitrary. As an alternative, we focus on a novel approach which configures indicators that evaluate topological threats to populations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We extended the current PzDom model to calculate a threshold of the model for accelerated growth, an indicator of growth extent Re(v), covariance Re(s), a topological number E(l), and expected sums of possibly increasing numbers of infected people. We term this the exPzDom model. RESULTS The indicators in the exPzDom model adhere well to the empirical dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infected people and align appropriately with actual policies instituted by the Japanese government. CONCLUSIONS The described indicators could be leveraged pursuant of objective evaluation based on mathematics. Further testing of the reliability and robustness of exPzDom model in other pandemic contexts is warranted.

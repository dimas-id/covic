Microneedles provide the advantages of convenience and compliance by avoiding the pain and fear of needles that animals often experience. Insertion-responsive microneedles (IRMN) were used for administration to a hairy dog without removing the dog’s hair. Canine H3N2 vaccine was administered with IRMN attached to the dog’s ears ex vivo and the conventional microneedle system (MN) was administered for 15 min to compare puncture performance and delivery efficiency. The vaccine was also administered to compare antibody formation using IRMN with the use of intramuscular injection. The veterinarian observed the behavior of the dog during the course of the administration and compared the response to IRMN with that of intramuscular administration. The tips of IRMN were separated from the base and delivered into the hairy skin successfully. Puncture performance of IRMN were the same as that of coated microneedles (95%), but delivery efficiency of IRMN were 95% compared to less than 1% for coated microneedles. The H3N2 vaccine inoculated into the dog's ears showed the same antibody formation as the intramuscular injection. The dog appeared to be more comfortable with IRMN administration compared to syringe administration. IRMN are the first microneedle system to deliver a canine vaccine successfully into a hairy dog without removal of the dog’s hair. The use of IRMN can provide both convenience and compliance for both the dog and the owner.

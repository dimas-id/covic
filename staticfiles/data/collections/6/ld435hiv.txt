In this article the mortality data from four European countries arising from the Covid-19 pandemic is modelled using logistic functions. The countries chosen for examination are Spain, Italy, France and the UK. They have been selected because in each the pandemic is advanced, mortality high and any prospect of containment has passed. They have also been selected because in each social distancing has been used in an attempt to reduce peak daily mortality with relatively strict enforcement following a defined date. The choices of data set and model type is justified. The impact, if any, of social distancing is examined.

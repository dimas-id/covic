M3d-CAM is an easy to use library for generating attention maps of CNN-based PyTorch models improving the interpretability of model predictions for humans. The attention maps can be generated with multiple methods like Guided Backpropagation, Grad-CAM, Guided Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++. These attention maps visualize the regions in the input data that influenced the model prediction the most at a certain layer. Furthermore, M3d-CAM supports 2D and 3D data for the task of classification as well as for segmentation. A key feature is also that in most cases only a single line of code is required for generating attention maps for a model making M3d-CAM basically plug and play.

Transformation is not only today’s trend but also a reality. Ports could not be excluded from that change. A transformation process has been initiated in order to change their operational structure, and the services they offer. Artificial Intelligent and Data oriented services push the services’s landscape beyond the traditional ones that are currently used. The scope of this paper is to analyze and scrutinize the opportunities that are risen for Telecommunications/Information and Communication Technology (ICT) providers at ports. These opportunities are the stepping stone towards the transformation of ports for the future. This work in progress is under the DataPorts project that is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 871493.

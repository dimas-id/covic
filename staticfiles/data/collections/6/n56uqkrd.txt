The sparse information available for multiple less commonly used species have been compiled with references. Clinical problems in animals are usually associated with changes in the blood and urine and core values are recommended for research, safety, and toxicity studies in laboratory animals. The core panel includes glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin globulin, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and total cholesterol; hematology tests includes total leukocyte count, erythrocyte count, erythrocyte morphology, platelet count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit or packed cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. Urinalysis tests are also recommended. Stress associated with restraint and handling may cause changes; anesthesia may produce changes in clinical biochemistry or hematology parameters, including decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and red blood cell count. Techniques for blood and urine collection are described.

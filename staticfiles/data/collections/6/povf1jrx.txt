Infection of H5N1 influenza virus causes the highest mortality among all influenza viruses. The mechanisms underlying such high viral pathogenicity are incompletely understood. Here, we report that the H5N1 influenza virus encodes a microRNA-like small RNA, miR-HA-3p, which is processed from a stem loop-containing viral RNA precursor by Argonaute 2, and plays a role in enhancing cytokine production during H5N1 infection. Mechanistic study shows that miR-HA-3p targets poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and suppresses its expression. Consistent with PCBP2 being an important negative regulator of RIG-I/MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity, suppression of PCBP2 expression by miR-HA-3p promotes cytokine production in human macrophages and mice infected with H5N1 virus. We conclude that miR-HA-3p is the first identified influenza virus-encoded microRNA-like functional RNA fragment and a novel virulence factor contributing to H5N1-induced 'cytokine storm' and mortality.

A designed nontoxic, nonhemolytic 11-residue peptide, NF11 (NAVRWSLMRPF), not only inhibits the aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ40) protein but also disaggregates the preformed oligomers and mature Aβ fibrils, thereby reducing associated-toxicity. NMR experiments provide evidence of NF11's ability to inhibit fibril formation, primarily through interaction with the N-terminus region as well as the central hydrophobic cluster of Aβ40. NF11 has micromolar binding affinity toward both monomeric and aggregated species for efficient clearance of toxic aggregates. From these in vitro results, the future development of a next generation peptidomimetic therapeutic agent for amyloid disease may be possible.

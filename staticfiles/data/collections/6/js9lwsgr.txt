Median arcuate ligament (MAL) syndrome or celiac artery compression occurs secondary to diaphragmatic compression of the celiac artery and the corresponding neural structures of the celiac plexus. Typically, patients present with postprandial abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Diagnostically, various radiologic studies are used to document impingement of the celiac artery including ultrasound, computed tomography, aortograms, and magnetic resonance imaging. Historically, open approaches to the aorta and the celiac artery are performed to release the MAL and relieve compression of the celiac artery and the plexus. Laparoscopic approaches are now utilized to divide the MAL. This study describes a patient who underwent a successful laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and lost 100 lbs over a 2-year postoperative period. Subsequently, the patient developed postprandial abdominal pain associated with nausea. She underwent a computed tomogram that diagnosed celiac compression and then a dynamic ultrasound that showed elevated velocities with deep expiration. Ultimately, a laparoscopic MAL release with division of the celiac plexus was performed. At 10 months postoperatively, the patient remains asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this report documents a rare case of CAC after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. On the basis of this report, CAC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of postprandial abdominal pain in patients after bariatric surgery.

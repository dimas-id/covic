Abstract Diammonium glycyrrhizin (DG), a salt from glycyrrhizinate (GL) that is a major active component of licorice root extract with various pharmacological activities was investigated for its inhibitory effect on pseudorabies virus (PrV) infection. In parallel, lithium chloride (LiCl), a chemical reagent with potential antiviral activity was compared with DG for their inhibitory ability against PrV infection in vitro. Virus plaque-reduction assays, PCR and RT-PCR analysis indicated that both drugs inhibited cell infection by PrV. Moreover, addition of the drugs resulted in fewer apoptotic cells during PrV infection.

In March of 2020, the COVID19 pandemic had expanded to the United States of America (US). Companies designated as essential for the US had to maintain productivity in spite of the growing threat created by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With this report, we present the response of one such company, the Lennar Corporation, a major homebuilder in the US. Within days, Lennar had implemented a morning health check via its enterprise resource planning system , to identify associates (employees) who were sick, or not in their usual state of health. With this survey, Lennar was able to ensure that no one sick would show up to work, and instead, would self-quarantine at home. Furthermore, with thorough contact tracking, associates exposed to COVID19 patients (suspected or RT-PCR test-confirmed), were also asked to self-quarantine. This survey, in addition to other safety measures, such as an overhaul of the company with nearly 50% of the company working from home, prolific communication, and many more measures, Lennar was able to function safely for its associates and successfully as an enterprise. The data that we present here are real world data collected in the context of working throughout a dreadful pandemic, and the lessons learned could be helpful to other companies that are preparing to return to work.

We wished to retrospectively evaluate the effects of permissive hypercapnia (PHY) on barotrauma, mortality and length of stay when applied to ventilated infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. Nineteen control infants with RSV induced respiratory failure were treated with conventional ventilation (April 1991–January 1994), after which time PHY was adopted as unit policy. A further 28 infants were then treated with PHY (January 1994–April 1996). Demographic and physiological data were collected from admission, and outcome variables including length of stay, barotrauma and mortality were recorded. The PHY group showed a significantly higher mean pCO(2) (7.6 vs 5.2 kPa), a lower mean pH (7.34 vs 7.40), and a reduction in maximal peak inspiratory pressures (25 vs 30 cmH(2)O). Mortality, barotrauma, use of neuromuscular blockade and nosocomial infection did not differ between groups. There was a trend towards increased length of ventilation in the PHY group (median 7 vs 5 days). Conclusion Based on this retrospective data we can show no benefit for the use of permissive hypercapnia as a ventilatory strategy in this patient group. A prospective randomised controlled trial is warranted to accurately assess the outcome variables and cost implications of this strategy.

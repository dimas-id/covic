In the literature, weight regain or failure of weight loss has been reported in up to 35% of patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Several revisional procedures have been suggested to reinitiate further weight loss in this group of patients, and placing a silastic ring around the pouch proximal to the gastrojejunostomy is one among those procedures. The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of salvage banding using a pericardial patch after RYGB for further weight loss. Between December 2009 and April 2013, a total of 46 patients underwent revision with pericardial patch ring after RYGB for weight regain/failure of weight loss. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed, noting the outcomes and complications of the procedure. The mean body mass index at the time of revision was 40.1 ± 6.8 kg/m2. Mean percentage of excess weight loss was 23.4 ± 15.7%, 39.0 ± 27.4%, and 18.9 ± 20.5% at 6, 12 and 24 months after revision, respectively. Eight (17.4%) patients required a total of 11 readmissions due to nausea, vomiting, dysphagia and abdominal pain. Six (13.0%) patients underwent a total of six reoperations, including four patients with laparoscopic removal of the pericardial patch and another revision of RYGB, and two patients with repair of perforated ulcers. Revision with pericardial patch ring after gastric bypass for weight regain or failure of weight loss may not be feasible, safe and effective.

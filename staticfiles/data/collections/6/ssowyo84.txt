The semiautomated Evidence Investigator has been applied to the simultaneous specific measurement of soluble adhesion molecules: L-, P-, E- selectins, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 using a reduced volume of sample. The biochip is the solid support and vessel where the sandwich immunoassay takes place. Signal detection, imaging, data processing, and storage are fully automated. Calibration curves are generated simultaneously for each analyte, with automatic validation against supplied calibration data. These curves are used for the calculation of the concentrations in multi-analyte controls and human serum samples. Data from the evaluation parameters assessed indicate suitability of the Evidence Investigator system for the application.

Frequently, patients with advanced cancer are suffered by various symptoms at the end of life. Furthermore, sometime experience unexpected loss of consciousness(LOC)and/or respiratory arrest. I examined carefully following neck stiffness, LOC, masked face, urinary retention, tonic and/or clonic convulsions, apnea, dysphagia, head rotation, neurogenic pain, hyperthermia, mydriasis 145 patients with advanced cancer. By assuming meningeal carcinomatosis, multifocal neurological findings are logically expected. As a result, before the LOC or respiratory arrest, I was able to logically explain to almost all families of patients, who with suspected neurological signs, expected multifocal neurological signs including LOC or respiratory arrest.

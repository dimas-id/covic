Cardiac surgery represents one of the largest consumers of blood products due to the level of blood loss in these patients. As such, there is considerable interest in hemostatic therapies for this patient population. A hemostatic agent that has recently garnered interest is fibrinogen. The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by activated thrombin results in clot formation, leading to hemostasis. Currently, a number of studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of fibrinogen concentrate in cardiac surgery patients. While potentially beneficial in hemostasis for cardiac patients, the current case report provides evidence of the importance of timing in the administration of this product.

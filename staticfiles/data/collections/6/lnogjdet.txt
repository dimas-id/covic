To ascertain what class of immunoglobulin (Ig; IgA, IgG, or IgM) is most efficacious in protection, a large quantity of colostrum from sows immunized with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus was fractionated by chromatographic and gel filtration methods. The isolated IgG, IgA, and IgM(A) had specific virus-neutralizing activities of 1:7.6, 1:342, and 1:302 per milligram of protein, respectively. Each Ig was fed to groups of hysterectomy-derived colostrum-deprived neonatal pigs before and after exposure (challenge) with virulent TGE virus. The 7 pigs fed IgG survived the challenge exposure, but 2 of 7 fed IgA and 1 of 7 fed IgM(A) died of TGE. Three of the survivor pigs that had been fed IgG and 2 of the survivor pigs that had been fed IgA had increased serum antibody titers between 8 and 19 days after challenge exposure, but none of the survivor pigs fed IgM(A) had TGE antibody. In contrast, 12 of 14 virus-control pigs died of TGE and the 2 survivors had antibody conversion. The data show that all 3 Ig classes in immune colostrum will protect neonatal pigs against exposure with virulent TGE virus.

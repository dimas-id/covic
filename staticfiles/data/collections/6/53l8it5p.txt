The possibility that some virus contaminants could be altering host response to Trypanosoma cruzi experimental infection was investigated. Data obtained showed that CBA/J mice infected with stocks of parasite maintained in mice (YIUEC) presented higher level of parasitemia and shorter survival times than those infected with a stock (YITC) which was also maintained in mice but had been previously passaged in cell culture. Mouse antibody production tests, performed with the filtered plasma of mice infected with YIUEC, indicated the presence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) while no virus was detected when testing the plasma of YITC infected mice. Filtered plasma of YIEUC infected mice was shown to contain a factor able to enhance the level of parasitemia and to reduce the mean survival time of mice challenged with 10(5) YITC. This factor, that could be serially passaged to na√Øve mice was shown to be a coronavirus by neutralization tests.

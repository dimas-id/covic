Wind energy continues to make inroads in Africa due to falling costs and technological advancements. Most African countries are planning, exsiccating and connecting their renewable energy projects with national grid system with giving high propriety to energy security, sustainable energy consumption and low carbon emission. Many policies have been enacted by countries to promote the scaling up of wind energy and renewable energy in particular, across the globe. However, these policies have mixed effects on the deployment of wind energy. For this purpose, current study used panel data and fixed effects model for 17 African countries with wind installed generation capacity to determine the driver of wind energy development on the African continent between 2008 and 2017. The variables were grouped into three thematic areas: policy, socioeconomic, and country-specific factors. After conducting the analysis, socioeconomic variables (GDP, CO(2), energy use) and energy security variables (energy import, electricity consumption) have significant effects in determining the scaling up of wind energy in Africa. However, the policy variables of FITs, licensing during, and Tax did not have significant effects on wind energy capacity addition for the case of Africa. This study adds to the drivers of nascent wind energy deployment literature in Africa. This study suggests that set of effecitive policies are deem necessary to scale up wind energy in Africa.

The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has focused the attention of medical-care providers away from non-life-threatening diseases, including infertility. Although infertility does not jeopardize the physical survival of infertile couples, it does jeopardize their future quality of life. Human infertility can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are age-dependent, and their effects may become irreversible if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent irreversible childlessness. Accordingly, each case of infertility should be evaluated comprehensively to establish its position of priority. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) makes it possible to separate fertilization and pregnancy in time. Whereas pregnant women infected with coronavirus may have an increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, gametes do not transmit COVID-19. Thus, performing ovarian stimulation and fertilization without delay, freezing the resulting embryos and delaying embryo transfer until the end of the pandemic appears to be the best strategy at present.

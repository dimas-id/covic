cDNA clones mapping within the first 2601 bases of the 3' end of the TGEV genome were sequenced completely or in part by the method of Maxam and Gilbert and open reading frames were examined. One reading frame yielding a protein having properties of the matrix (M) protein was identified. It is positioned at the immediate 5' side of the nucleocapsid (N) gene but is separated by an intergenic region of 12 bases. The deduced M protein is comprised of 262 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 29,544, is moderately hydrophobic, and has an amino acid sequence homology of approximately 36% with the mouse hepatitis coronavirus, 37% with the bovine enteric coronavirus, and 28% with the avian infectious bronchitis virus. Judging from an alignment with MHV and IBV proteins, the amino terminus of the TGEV M protein extends 54 amino acids from the virion envelope which compares with 26 for MHV and 21 for IBV.

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has a significant impact on global health, travel and economy. Therefore, preventative and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. Here, we isolated neutralizing antibodies from convalescent COVID-19 patients using a SARS-CoV-2 stabilized prefusion spike protein. Several of these antibodies were able to potently inhibit live SARS-CoV-2 infection at concentrations as low as 0.007 Âµg/mL, making them the most potent human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies described to date. Mapping studies revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contained multiple distinct antigenic sites, including several receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes as well as previously undefined non-RBD epitopes. In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, these mAbs are promising candidates for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND Public disputations affected vaccine confidence and vaccine rates particularly when adverse events occur. The vigorous development of Internet in China provides an opportunity to observe public reaction and sentiment toward vaccination when Kangtai Hepatitis B vaccine crisis happened and evolved to a widespread debate on the internet from December 12, 2013 to January 3, 2014. METHODS This study conducted Internet surveillance by examining three daily indicators including the daily number of relevant online news article, Sina Weibo posts and Baidu search index during the crisis. We also analyzed the sentiments of relevant original microblog posts collected from Sina Weibo platform in the crisis. RESULTS A total of 17 infant deaths were reported to associated with Hepatitis B vaccination. Three major waves of high media and public attention were detected. The daily indicators reached their peaks in the second wave after the relevant vaccine was suspended by the authority (from December 20 to December 29, 2013) with 23,200 daily online news reports, 34,018 Sina Weibo posts and 17,832 Baidu search indices. There were significant correlations between the daily amount of online news, Weibo posts, and Baidu searches (p<.001). The contents analysis suggested 1343 out of 1608 (83.5%) original Weibo posts expressed negative sentiment with almost 90% in the second wave. CONCLUSION This study found the Kangtai vaccine crisis raised great public attention and negative sentiment toward vaccinations on the internet in China. Policy change such as suspension of the suspected vaccine might trigger even greater reaction and more negative sentiment. The government should provide ways to address emerging public concerns after policy change to avoid misinformation and misunderstanding during such a vaccine crisis.

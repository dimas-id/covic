• This is an insightful perspective from surgeons working in Italy and the USA on the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of surgeons. • Surgeons have so far been side-lined to supportive roles in this crisis and the focus has been on emergency and intensive care. • Elective surgical activity has been largely cancelled and invasive investigations such as endoscopy have been abandoned. Emergency surgery is occurring as open procedures (rather than laparoscopic) where conservative management is not an option. • Re-establishment of Elective surgery will focus initially on cancer patients that have been delayed. Specialties, countries, and regions will differ in their approach depending on their local infrastructure and resources. • Altered healthcare seeking behaviours have led to a reduction in emergency activity and there may be a rebound surge in demand later on. • Trainees have had their training put on hold, many will inevitably require an extension to their training. • The on-going role of the surgical community in the post COVID-19 era will be a hotly debated topic going forwards. • We thank Roberto Verzaro and Seigo Nishida for their perspective.

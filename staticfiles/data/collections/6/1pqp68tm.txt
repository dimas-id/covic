Rotaviruses are the leading etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. These nonenveloped viruses enter cells using different types of endocytosis and, depending on the virus strain, travel to different endosomal compartments before exiting to the cytosolic space. In this Gem, we review the viral and cellular factors involved in the different stages of a productive virus cell entry and share with the readers the journey that we have taken into the cell to learn about virus entry.

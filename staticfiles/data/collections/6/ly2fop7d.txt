Despite the increased attention given to the health impact assessment of air pollution and to the strategies to control it in both scientific literature and concrete interventions, the results of the implementations, especially those involving traffic, have not always been satisfactory and there is still disagreement about the most appropriate interventions and the methods to assess their effectiveness. This state-of-the-art article reviews the recent interpretation of the concepts that concern the impact assessment, and compares old and new measurements of attributable risk and attributable fraction. It also summarizes the ongoing discussion about the designs and methods for assessing the air pollution impact with particular attention to improvements due to spatio-temporal analysis and other new approaches, such as studying short term effects in cohorts, and the still discussed methods of predicting the values of attributable risk (AR). Finally, the study presents the more recent analytic perspectives and the methods for directly assessing the effects of not yet implemented interventions on air quality and health, in accordance with the suggestion in the strategic plan 2020âˆ’2025 from the Health Effect Institute.

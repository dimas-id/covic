Advances in viral detection in bovine respiratory disease (BRD) have resulted from advances in viral sequencing of respiratory tract samples. New viruses detected include influenza D virus, bovine coronavirus, bovine rhinitis A, bovine rhinitis B virus, and others. Serosurveys demonstrate widespread presence of some of these viruses in North American cattle. These viruses sometimes cause disease after animal challenge, and some have been found in BRD cases more frequently than in healthy cattle. Continued work is needed to develop reagents for identification of new viruses, to confirm their pathogenicity, and to determine whether vaccines have a place in their control.

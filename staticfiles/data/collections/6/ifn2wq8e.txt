BACKGROUND Tocovid is a new combination of tocotrienols and tocopherol, both of which are neuroprotective agents for preventing cerebral infarction in mice. However, the effects of tocovid on anti-inflammation in ischemic model remain elusive. In the present study, we assessed the effects of Tocovid pretreatment on anti-inflammatory effects after transient middle cerebral occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated the therapeutic and anti-inflammatory effects of tocovid pretreatment (200 mg/kg per day, for 1 month) on mice brain under 60 minutes of tMCAO. The expressive changes of inflammatory markers were observed after tMCAO in mice. RESULTS Tocovid pretreatment greatly improved the mice neurobehaviors, reduced infarct volumes and decreased expressions of inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1), and improved the damage of neurovascular units including matrix metallopeptidase 9, IgG and collagen IV after tMCAO. CONCLUSIONS Our present findings demonstrated that oral tocovid pretreatment showed obviously neuroprotective and at least in part by anti-inflammatory effects in ischemic mice brain.

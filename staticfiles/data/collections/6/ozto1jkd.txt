We evaluated the microbiological diagnosis in 14 patients with epidemiological and clinical suspicion of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) attended in a non-endemic area between June 2015 and January 2017. While no MERS-CoV was detected, other respiratory viruses were identified in 12 cases and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 1 case.

Although a lot of correct and useful information is shared through channels such as Twitter, it has also become a home ground for misinformation on COVID-19. To tackle this still ongoing infodemic, scientific oversight as well as a better understanding by practitioners in crisis management is needed. We have conducted an exploratory study into the propagation, authors and content of misinformation on Twitter around the topic of COVID-19 in order to gain early insights into the COVID-19 infodemic. Our results enable us to not only give first indications but also to suggest gaps in the current scientific coverage of the topic. Moreover, we propose actions for authorities to counter misinformation and hints for social media users on how to help stop the spread of misinformation.

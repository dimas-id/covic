This article focuses on an ontology construction for collaborative decision making. To do this, a state of the art on collaborative decision-making, on ontology engineering and on collaboration engineering has been done. An eight-step ontology development methodology was adopted and implemented to build the ontology. A corpus made up of more than seventy-seven (77) documents was the starting point for the extraction of terms from the ontology and the UML (Unified Modeling Language) language served as a description language of our ontology. This ontology is intended to be the starting point for a facilitation support system in a Collaborative Decision Making process. The aim of the work is to produce a new system according the “Facilitator in the box” paradigm.

Background: Recently, a novel coronavirus was reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The novel coronavirus infection was spread from China to other countries, including Iran. Objectives: We report the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and chest exams of infected patients. Methods: All patients suspected to the novel coronavirus were hospitalized in a special airborne protection room. We collected and analyzed the characteristics of confirmed patients by data extraction from electronic medical records. Results: The Computerized Tomography (CT) scan and radiography results showed ground glass in the lung of patients, and real-time PCR confirmed the infection. The myocardial and liver function tests showed abnormalities in infected patients. Conclusions: Most patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) showed respiratory problems, and their infection was confirmed by virological tests and chest images. The main reason for the patientâ€™s death was the signs of acute heart failure, such as hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia.

ABSTRACT Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused an unprecedented global health emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed over 350,000 human lives within five months of its emergence, especially in the USA and the European continent. This study analysed the implications of the genetic diversity and mutations in SARS-CoV-2 on its virulence diversity and investigated how these factors could affect the successful development and application of antiviral chemotherapy, immunotherapy, serodiagnosis, and vaccination. Methods All the suitable and eligible full text articles published between 31st December 2019 and 31st May 2020 were filtered and extracted from “PubMed”, “Scopus”, “Web of Science”, and “Hinari” and were critically reviewed. We used the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms “COVID-19, “Mutation”, “Genetic diversity”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Virulence”, “Pathogenicity”, “Evolution” and “SARS-CoV-2 transmission” for this search. Results Our search showed that SARS-CoV-2 has persistently undergone significant mutations in various parts of its non-structural proteins (NSPs), including NSP2 and NSP3, S protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In particular, the S protein was found to be the key determinant of evolution, transmission, and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, and could be a potential target for vaccine development. Additionally, RdRp could be a major target in the development of antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion Given the critical importance of mutations in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and in the development of sero-diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines, this study recommends continuous molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. This approach would potentially prompt identification of new mutants and their impact on ongoing biomedical interventions and COVID-19 control measures.

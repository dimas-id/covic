Selection of proper assays and appropriate interpretation of results can be a challenge to the veterinary clinician. Assays vary in methodology, sensitivity, and specificity. These assays can be invaluable in attaining the correct diagnosis, but a clear understanding of the assay and the results is essential. To this end, communication with the laboratory personnel is crucial. Optimal sample selection, shipping recommendations, assay selection, and interpretation should be discussed with the laboratory staff.

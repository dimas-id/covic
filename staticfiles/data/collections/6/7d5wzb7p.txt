Pregnant women are at the highest risk to develop severe and even fatal influenza. The high vulnerability of women against influenza A virus infections during pregnancy was repeatedly highlighted during influenza pandemics including the pandemic of this century. In 2009, mortality rates were particularly high among otherwise healthy pregnant women. However, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in severe disease development during pregnancy is still very limited. In this review, we summarize the knowledge on the clinical observations in influenza A virus-infected pregnant women. In addition, knowledge obtained from few existing experimental infections in pregnant animal models is discussed. Since clinical data do not provide in-depth information on the pathogenesis of severe influenza during pregnancy, adequate animal models are urgently required that mimic clinical findings. Studies in pregnant animal models will allow the dissection of involved molecular disease pathways that are key to improve patient management and care.

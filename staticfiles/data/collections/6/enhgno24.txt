Abstract Background Reports on neurologic manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have attracted broad attention. We present the unusual case of COVID-19-associated encephalitis mimicking a glial tumor. Case description A 35-year-old woman presented with headache and seizures. T2 fluid-attenuated inverse recovery imaging showed hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed an elevated choline peak. Imaging findings were suggestive of high-grade glioma. Antiepileptic medication failed to achieve seizure control. Left anterior temporal lobectomy was performed. The patient had no post-operative deficits and her symptoms completely improved. Histological examination revealed encephalitis. Post-operatively, our patient was tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusions Our case raises awareness of neurologic manifestations of the disease and their potential to mimic glial tumors. For prompt diagnosis and prevention of transmission, clinicians should consider COVID-19 in patients with similar presentation.

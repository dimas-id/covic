Abstract The influenza viruses, which contain single-stranded RNA, are classified into three types, A, B, and C and belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses. Types A and B cause annual epidemics and often pandemics of influenza illness, while type C is a less common disease with fewer symptoms.

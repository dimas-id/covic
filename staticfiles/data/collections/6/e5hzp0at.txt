We conduct simulations of white dwarf (WD) - neutron star (NS) reverse evolution, and conclude that a core collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion might occur inside a planetary nebula (PN) only if a third star forms the PN. In the WD-NS reverse evolution the primary star evolves and transfers mass to the secondary star, forms a PN, and leaves a WD remnant. If the mass transfer brings the secondary star to have a mass of>8Mo before it develops a helium core, it explodes as a CCSN and leaves a NS remnant. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) we find that in the reverse evolution the time period from the formation of the PN by the primary star to the explosion of the secondary star is longer than a million years. By that time the PN has long dispersed into the interstellar medium. If we start with two stars that are too close in mass to each other, then the mass transfer takes place after the secondary star has developed a helium core and it ends forming a PN and a WD. The formation of a CCSN inside a PN (so called CCSNIP) requires the presence of a third star, either as a tertiary star in the system or as a nearby member in an open cluster. The third star should be less massive than the secondary star but by no more than few 0.01Mo. We estimate that the rate of CCSNIP is about 0.0001 times the rate of all CCSNe.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. It has been declared a pandemic and has infected at least 1,844,683 individuals and caused 117,021 deaths as of 14th April 2020. Transmission among humans occurs via close contact with an infected individual that produces respiratory droplets. Patients have been shown to undergo acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is defined as cytokine storm. The diagnosis relies on detection of nucleic acid, IgG/IgM antibodies, and a chest radiograph of the suspected individuals. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that comprise of ten open reading frames (ORFs). SARS-CoV-2 spike protein exhibits higher affinity to ACE2 receptor as compared with SARS-CoV. Repurposing drugs like favipiravir, remdesivir, chloroquine, and TMPRSS2 protease inhibitors have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Personal protective measures should be followed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, a clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mRNA-1273, has been started. This chapter provides a glimpse of advancements made in the area of SARS-CoV-2 infection by proving recent clinical and research trials in the field.

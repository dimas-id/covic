Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is a novel area of minimally invasive surgery, and rapidly evolving in the field of abdominal surgery. However, SILS is not a common procedure for pancreatic surgery. We describe our first experience with a SILS approach in a patient with a metastatic pancreatic tumor. We performed a SILS distal pancreatectomy (SILS-DP) using 3 trocars placed through a single port at an umbilical incision. In our case, the most important surgical technique was the stomach-hanging method to obtain a favorable laparoscopic view of the pancreas. Although SILS-DP is a safe and feasible procedure, further studies are required to determine the advantages of this procedure in comparison with the standard laparoscopic method.

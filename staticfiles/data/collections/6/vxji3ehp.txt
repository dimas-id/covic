Due to coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) prevailing in more than 210 countries, out of them only few have promulgated lockdown and on March 24, 2020 India also implemented lockdown for 21 days to prevent the community spread of virus among people. Since then, lockdown heavily restricts travel movements of flights, rail, intercity bus services besides industrial activity halt throughout the country. The significant improvement in the air quality of Delhi region was observed due to strict implementation of lockdown. During the lockdown period, improvement in ambient air quality helped us in circumventing the coronavirus community spread. The preliminary results showing the decrease in horizontal advection of pollutants has given an opportunity to understand the background concentrations of air pollutants over Delhi. To analyse this peculiar situation, we have assessed the pollutants datasets collected by twelve different online ambient air quality monitoring stations (AQMS) of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), New Delhi, India and observed a colossal improvement in the ambient air quality. The analysis of data confirms the sharp decline in concentrations (nearly 200%) of PM(2.5) and PM(10). The concentration of nitrous oxides (NO(x)), recorded its maximum (342 ppb) on 12 January 2020 in CRRIâ€“Mathura Road, Delhi with the lowest value as 24 ppb on 30 March 2020 (reduced to nearly 14 times of the peak value). In the triad of this infectious disease, the role of environment is not linked better however, the ground reality cannot be ignored due to environment around us receives, maintains, protects and transports the aetiological agents to host prevailing in polluted environment which makes our lungs more susceptible to viral attacks. Therefore, a cleaner environment would prove to be an effective measure to halt and reduce the transmission of viral infections.

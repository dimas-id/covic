An obturator hernia is a rare diagnosis that is frequently missed. Patients present with few clinical signs to identify the cause, apart from symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Therefore, obturator hernias are often diagnosed at exploratory laparotomy. The use of computed tomography (CT) has increased the chance of definitive preoperative diagnosis. However, despite these advances, patients who present acutely will frequently undergo an open procedure rather than laparoscopy. We present a case of an acute obstructed obturator hernia diagnosed in a 62-year-old female that was successfully managed laparoscopically.

BACKGROUND There is limited information related to COVID-19 in pregnancy. OBJECTIVES Evaluate the impact of COVID-19 during pregnancy. Search strategy: Searches were systematically carried out in PubMed, Scopus database and WHO database. Selection criteria: Studies with information related to the effects of COVID-19 in pregnancy, concerning maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes were included. Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted for systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. CARE and STROBE were used to evaluate the quality of data. Main Results: A total of 8 studies involving 95 pregnant women and 51 neonates were included. Overall, the quality was considered good in four studies, moderate in three and poor in one. Among pregnant women, 26% had a history of epidemiological exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms presented were fever (55%), cough (38%) and fatigue (11%). In 50 deliveries, 94% were cesarean sections and 35% were preterm births. Of the 51 neonates, 20% had low birth weight and 1 tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. There was 1 neonatal death, not related to the viral infection, and no cases of severe neonatal asphyxia. CONCLUSIONS The information compiled in this systematic review may help healthcare providers administer the best possible care.

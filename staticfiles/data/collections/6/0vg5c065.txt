Connexin 43 (Cx43), a ubiquitous connexin expressed in the heart and skin, is associated with a variety of hereditary conditions. Therefore, the characterization of Cx43-interacting proteins and their dynamics is important to understand not only the molecular mechanisms underlying pathological malfunction of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication but also to identify novel and unanticipated biological functions of Cx43. In the present study, we observed potential targets of Cx43 to determine new molecular functions in cardio-protection. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of Cx43 co-immunoprecipitated proteins showed that Cx43 interacts with several proteins related to metabolism. In GeneMANIA network analysis, SGSM3, which has not been previously associated with Cx43, was highly correlated with Cx43 in heart functions, and high levels of SGSM3 appeared to induce the turnover of Cx43 through lysosomal degradation in myocardial infarcted rat hearts. Moreover, we confirmed that lysosomal degradation of Cx43 is dependent upon the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. The functional importance of the interaction between SGSM3 and Cx43 was confirmed by results showing that Cx43 expression was enhanced by SGSM3 siRNA knockdown in H9c2 cells. In summary, the results of this study elucidate the molecular mechanisms in which Cx43 with SGSM3 is degraded in myocardial infarcted rat hearts, which may contribute to the establishment of new therapeutic targets to modulate cardiac function in physiological and pathological conditions.

Travellers are more than ever choosing to visit adventurous destinations, sometimes in remote places. In addition, the ease of international travel makes it possible for travellers with underlying medical conditions, such as immunosuppression, the elderly, pregnant women and children to travel to destinations that may place them at risk of a range of exotic infections. It is therefore important for the travel medicine practitioner to have a firm understanding of the spectrum of infections that travellers may acquire according to their travel destination. This chapter provides an overview of the spectrum of infections travellers may encounter and provides an approach to the diagnosis and management of ill returned travellers.

A modified-live vaccine against the respiratory form of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infection was developed by progressive attenuation of a respiratory strain (438/06-TN). The vaccine was found to be safe as four colostrum-deprived newborn calves remained healthy after oronasal administration of ten doses of the vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was assessed by intramuscular injection of one vaccine dose to 30 BCoV-antibody negative 2-3-month-old calves. At 30 days post-vaccination, all vaccinated calves displayed high antibody titres against BCoV. Sequence analysis of the S gene of wild-type and cell-adapted 438/06-TN strain detected 10 nucleotide changes, 9 of which were non-synonymous.

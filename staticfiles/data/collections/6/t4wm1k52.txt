OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perceptions and behaviors of rheumatologists in the United States (US) regarding the risk of COVID-19 for their autoimmune patients and the subsequent management of immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory medications. METHODS: We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists in the US from 4/8/20-5/4/20 via social media and group emails. Survey respondents provided demographic information such as, age, gender, state of practice, and practice type. We asked questions about COVID-19 risk in rheumatic patients, as well as their medication management during the pandemic. We conducted descriptive analysis and Multivariable regression models. RESULTS: 271 respondents completed the survey nationally. 48% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “Patients with rheumatic diseases are at a higher risk of COVID-19 irrespective of their immunosuppressive medications”. 50% disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement “The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of biologics”, while 56% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “The pandemic has led you to reduce the use/dosage/frequency of steroids”. A third of respondents indicated that at least 10% of their patients had self-discontinued or reduced at least one immunosuppressive medication to mitigate their risk of COVID-19. Responses to these questions as well as to questions regarding NSAID prescription patterns were significantly different in the Northeast region of US compared to other regions. CONCLUSION: In this national sample of rheumatologists, there are variations regarding perceptions of patients’ risk of COVID-19, and how to manage medications such as NSAIDs, biologics and steroids during the pandemic. These variations are more pronounced in geographical areas where COVID-19 disease burden was high.

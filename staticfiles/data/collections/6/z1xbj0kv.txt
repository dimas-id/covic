BACKGROUND Anastomotic leakage after total gastrectomy occurs despite improvements in surgical techniques and patient management. Although many cases of dehiscence can be managed non-operatively, major leakage requires a second surgery and can potentially lead to death. Therefore, accurate and immediate diagnosis and treatment are essential. CASE PRESENTATION In this report, we describe a 66-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed with a complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis after laparoscopic total gastrectomy with oral contrast radiography using GastrografinÂ®. The severe complication was successfully treated by re-anastomosis after two emergency drainage surgeries. After the second surgery, the esophageal end formed a fistula with the jejunum, but balloon dilation failed to open the fistula. Therefore, oral ingestion and conservative treatment were considered unsuitable, and we performed esophagojejunal re-anastomosis 7 months after the first surgery. At a follow-up examination 2 years after re-anastomosis, the patient weighed 47 kg, and his ingestion had recovered to 80% of that before surgery. CONCLUSIONS Complete separation of an esophagojejunal anastomosis is a rare but severe complication of total gastrectomy. Therefore, we consider that once separation is diagnosed, aggressive and urgent re-operation and effective drainage are useful. Moreover, it is necessary to take great care to minimize the operative morbidity associated with esophagojejunal anastomosis.

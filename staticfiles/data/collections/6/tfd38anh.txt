This study evaluated the clinical usefulness of a newly introduced multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay (Seeplex RV; Seegene, Inc., Seoul, Korea) in patients with respiratory symptoms. Fifty clinical respiratory specimens (45 from children, 5 from adults) were tested for 8 viruses (influenza virus type A and B, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, respiratory syncytial virus type A and B, and adenovirus) by Seeplex RV (S-RV) and R-mix viral culture with immunofluorescence (VC-IF). Forty (80%) of the 50 samples showed concordant results between S-RV and VC-IF; 24 of these showed the same positive and 16 showed the same negative results. Among the 10 discrepant samples, 9 were S-RV-positive and VC-IF-negative. Six were obtained in patients with lower respiratory tract infection. Only 1 sample was VC-IF-positive and S-RV-negative. This patient had pneumonia. In 3 cases, more than 1 virus was identified by S-RV. The total running time of S-RV was 6 hr, which shortens the detection time for the viral presence by 2 workdays compared to VC-IF. In conclusion, S-RV is reliable, rapid, relatively easy to perform, and able to detect more than 1 virus simultaneously. Therefore, implementation of the S-RV assay in clinical laboratories will aid rapid diagnosis and treatment of major viral infections of the respiratory tract.

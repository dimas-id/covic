Many newly developed animal models involve the transfer of cells, serum, or other tissue-derived products into live rodents. These biologics can serve as repositories for adventitious rodent pathogens that, when used in animal studies, can alter research outcomes and result in endemic outbreaks. This review includes a description of some of the biologics that have inadvertently introduced infectious agents into in vivo studies and/or resulted in endemic outbreaks. I also discuss the points of potential exposure of specific biologics to adventitious rodent pathogens as well as the importance of acquiring a complete developmental and testing history of each biologic introduced into a barrier facility. There are descriptions of specific cases of mycoplasma and lactate dehydrogenaseâ€“elevating virus (LDHV), two of the most common organisms that contaminate cells and cell byproducts. The information in this article should help investigators and animal resource program personnel to perform an appropriate risk assessment of biologics before their use in in vivo studies that involve rodents.

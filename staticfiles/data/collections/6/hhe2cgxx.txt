An anastomotic leak can be one of the most morbid and complex complications after esophagectomy. Typically, management can entail repair, stenting, or diversion. The leak complicates a patient's postoperative course and delays initiation of any adjuvant therapy. Novel minimally invasive tools created to expedite healing of the anastomotic leak may potentially limit additional procedures traditionally used to treat the leak. We present the case of a 49-year-old man who sustained an anastomotic leak 5 days after undergoing esophagectomy for cancer. He was initially managed with drainage, and when this failed, he was transferred to our hospital. An endoscopic suturing device was used to close the leak and pexy a partially covered self-expanding metal stent that was left in place for 2 weeks. At the end of 2 weeks, the leak healed and there was no stent migration.

BACKGROUND Single-port laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (S-LAVH) uses only one transumbilical incision site and has better cosmetic result than conventional multiport LAVH. This study aimed to evaluate our initial experience with S-LAVH compared with the more conventional three-port LAVH in women with benign uterine diseases. METHODS Between April 2009 and April 2010, S-LAVH was attempted on 183 patients with benign uterine diseases through a transumbilical incision for a 12-mm trocar, and conventional LAVH was performed on 275 patients by the same surgeon. The medical records of patients were reviewed. The age, body mass index, operative time, blood loss, and uterine weight on pathologic report were compared. RESULTS Two of 183 patients in the S-LAVH group were converted to two- or three-port surgery, compared with none in the conventional group. Data analysis was done for 181 patients in the S-LAVH group and 275 patients in the conventional LAVH group. No major complications, including ureteral or bladder injuries, occurred in any of the patients. No statistically significant differences were found in mean age, mean body mass index, mean operative time, mean anesthesia time, mean estimated blood loss, or mean postoperative days to passage of flatus, but the mean uterine weights on the pathologic reports were significantly reduced in the S-LAVH group. CONCLUSION S-LAVH could be a feasible alternative method for removal of the uterus with a better cosmetic outcome resulting from single wound in selected patients. For patients with large-sized uterus, more surgical experience and improvement in instruments suitable for S-LAVH are needed.

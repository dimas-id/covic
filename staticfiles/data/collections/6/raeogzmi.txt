This chapter presents a synopsis of mustelid pathology. The depth of disease knowledge varies widely across species. It is greatest for mustelids with the strongest connections to humans (ferrets, mink, and otters). Similar conditions may occur in other mustelids, but have been missed due to limited examination by pathologists, providing ample opportunity for scientific discovery and improved clinical care. Globally mustelids are highly valued by humans as companions and commercial purposes, as the focus of conservation efforts, and as providers of beneficial ecosystem services, such as structuring their environment to optimize habitat for sympatric species. Although skunks and stink-badgers are no longer classified within the Mustelidae, they are included here for the sake of comparison and completeness. Members range from 25 g to 45 kg, occupy marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and exploit fully aquatic, arboreal, and fossorial lifestyles.

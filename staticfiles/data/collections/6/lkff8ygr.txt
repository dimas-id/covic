Since about a year, a new pulmonary pathology occurred in Saudi Arabia and some cases are imported in Europa. This disease is due to a coronavirus named MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndome Coronavirus). The main symptoms are fever, pulmonary and digestive troubles, with a risk of nosocomial transmission and a mortality of about 42%. The reservoir is probably the dromedary camel and the bat is the vector. There is no specific treatment or vaccine.

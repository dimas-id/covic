The generation of computational models is an alternative route to obtain reliable structures for the oligomeric state of membrane proteins. A strategy has been developed to search the conformational space of all possible assemblies in a reasonable time, taking symmetry considerations into account. The methodology tested on M2 from influenza A, shows an excellent agreement with established structures. For Vpu from HIV-1 a series of conformational distinct structures are proposed. For the first time a structural model for a fully assembled transmembrane part of 3a from SARS-CoV is proposed.

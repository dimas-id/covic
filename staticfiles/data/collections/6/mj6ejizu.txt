Among the numerous products available from plants, the flavonoid superfamily plays a central role by its large number of molecules (over 6000) and also by the role these products occupy in the normal physiology of plants. Flavonoids are secondary plant metabolites involved in several biological processes (e.g., germination, UV protection, insecticides) and are also involved in the attraction of pollinating agents via the vivid colors of the anthocyanin pigments found in flowers (e.g., blue, purple, yellow, orange, and red) [1â€“3]. Flavonoids are found in the normal human diet composed of green vegetables, onions, fruits (apples, grapes, strawberries, etc.), beverages (coffee, tea, beer, red wine) [4, 5], and isoflavonoids are mainly found in soya bean-derived products [6].

The clinical management of COVID-19 is challenging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the early detection, clinical monitoring and outcomes assessment of this disease. Chest x-ray radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are the standard imaging modalities used for the structural assessment of the disease status, while functional imaging (namely, positron emission tomography) has had limited application. Artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance the predictive power and utilization of these imaging approaches and new approaches focusing on detection, stratification and prognostication are showing encouraging results. We review the current landscape of these imaging modalities and AI approaches as applied in COVID-19 management.

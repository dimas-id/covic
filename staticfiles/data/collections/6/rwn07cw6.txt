BACKGROUND The diagnostic performance of a genetic score based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is unknown in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) range of 1-3 ng/ml. A substantial proportion of men in this PSA span have prostate cancer (PCa), but biomarkers to determine who should undergo a prostate biopsy are lacking. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether a genetic risk score identifies men in the PSA range of 1-3 ng/ml who are at higher risk for PCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Men aged 50-69 yr with PSA 1-3 ng/ml and without a previous prostate biopsy were selected from the STHLM2 cohort. Of 2696 men, 49 SNPs were genotyped, and a polygenic risk score was calculated. Of these men, 860 were invited according to risk score, and 172 underwent biopsy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The risk of PCa was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS PCa was diagnosed in 47 of 172 participants (27%), with Gleason sum 6 in 36 of 47 men (77%) and Gleason sum â‰¥7 in 10 of 47 men (21%); one man had intraductal cancer. The genetic score was a significant predictor of a positive biopsy (p=0.028), even after adjusting for PSA, ratio of free to total PSA, prostate volume, age, and family history. There was an increase in the odds ratio of 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.45) with increasing genetic risk score. The absolute risk difference of positive biopsy was 19 percentage points, comparing the high and low genetic risk group (37% vs 18%). CONCLUSIONS A risk score based on SNPs predicts biopsy outcome in previously unbiopsied men with PSA 1-3 ng/ml. Introducing a genetic-based risk stratification tool can increase the proportion of men being classified in line with their true risk of PCa.

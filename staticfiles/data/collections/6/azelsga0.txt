1. Abstract Anti‐endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) represent a heterogeneous family of autoantibodies directed against structural endothelial proteins, as well as antigens adhering to endothelial cells. Although AECA immunoassays still show a high‐interlaboratory variability, several findings suggest a pathogenic role of these autoantibodies in diseases characterized by endothelial damage. In this chapter, we analyze the knowledge about AECA prevalence, clinical relevance, and their pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases focusing in particular on systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic sclerosis (SSc), and systemic vasculitis.

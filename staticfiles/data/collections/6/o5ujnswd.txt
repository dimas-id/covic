RATIONALE Obesity is considered a relative contraindication to pancreas transplantation due to increased risks of wound-related complications. Robotic surgeries have never been applied for pancreas transplantation in obese recipients though robotic kidney transplantation did and already proved its value in reducing wound-related complications in obese recipients. PATIENT CONCERNS & DIAGNOSES We performed the first robotic pancreas after kidney transplantation for a 34-year-old Hispanic type 1 diabetic male with class III obesity (BMI = 41 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS The pancreas graft was procured and benched in the standard fashion. Methylene blue was used to detect any vascular leaks. The operation was completed via two 12-mm ports (camera, laparoscopic bed-side assistance), two 8-mm ports for robotic arms, and a 7-cm epigastric incision for hand port. The portal vein and arterial Y-graft of the pancreas were anastomosed to the recipient's left external iliac vein and artery, respectively. Duodenum-bladder drainage was performed with a circular stapler. OUTCOMES Duration of warm and cold ischemia was: 45 minutes and 7 hours, respectively. The patient was discharged uneventfully without wound-related complications. Excellent metabolic control was achieved with hemoglobin A1c lowering from 9% before transplantation to 4.4% on day 120. The patient remained in nondiabetic status in 1-year follow-up. LESSONS In conclusion, robotic pancreas transplantation is feasible in patients with morbid obesity.

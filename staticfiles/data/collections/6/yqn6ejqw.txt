Using carbohydrate microarrays, we characterized the carbohydrate binding activity of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies elicited by an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine. In these antibodies, we detected undesired autoantibody reactivity specific for the carbohydrate moieties of an abundant human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR). This observation provides important clues for the selection of specific immunologic probes to examine whether SARS-CoV expresses antigenic structures that mimic the host glycan. We found that lectin PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), which is specific for a defined complex carbohydrate of ASOR, stained the SARS-CoV-infected cells specifically and intensively. Taken together, we present immunologic evidence that a carbohydrate structure of SARS-CoV shares antigenic similarity with host glycan complex carbohydrates. The experimental approaches we applied in this study are likely applicable for the identification of immunologic targets of other viral pathogens.

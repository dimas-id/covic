BACKGROUND Medical students in China face severe depression and anxiety because of their difficult circumstances, such as the long length of schooling, academic pressure, and the stress of clinical practice. Although there have been many empirical studies about depression or anxiety in medical students in China, no previous studies have conducted a related systematic review about this topic in English. This analysis can convey the general findings from China to other areas of the world. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of depression or anxiety in medical students and related determinants were conducted. Three Chinese and three English databases were searched for the review, with no restrictions on language. Articles published between January 1, 2000 and April 1, 2018 were included. RESULTS Twenty-one articles investigating a total of 35,160 individual Chinese medical students were included in this review. The prevalence of depression ranged from 13.10 to 76.21% with a mean of 32.74%, and the prevalence of anxiety ranged from 8.54 to 88.30% with a mean of 27.22%. Based on the meta-analysis, gender, grade level, residence, satisfaction with current major and monthly household income per capita were significantly associated with depression. Grade level and satisfaction with current major were significantly associated with anxiety. Other risk factors were identified and described using a narrative approach. CONCLUSION The mean prevalence of depression was 32.74% amongst medical students in China, whereas the mean prevalence of anxiety was 27.22%. The determinants of depression and anxiety included individual factors, social and economic factors, and environmental factors. More measures should be taken towards at-risk medical students based on the identified risk factors.

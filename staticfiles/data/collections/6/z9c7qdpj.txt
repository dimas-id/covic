Abstract This article discusses how evolutionary and ecological factors interact to affect the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases. It further explains how the nascent field of phylodynamics constructs mathematical models, which link evolution and epidemiology, to study pathogen transmission. To illustrate the importance of considering both evolution and ecology – along with the utility of the phylodynamic approach – when studying novel pathogens, the author considers examples from HIV, influenza, and Ebola.

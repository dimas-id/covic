Originating in China during December 2019, the novel corona-virus, SARS-CoV-2, has created mayhem worldwide in a very short time. The outbreak has been so rapid and widespread that the only option to treat the patients was administering drugs already available in the market like chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (an antimalarial drug) and remedesivir. A large number of patients have been cured but the attribution to survival by these drugs has been controversial. Till date, we do not have any specific drug or vaccine available for COVID-19 and the pandemic seems to be far from over. To handle the current challenges posed by the outbreak effectively, we need to employ innovative interdisciplinary approaches. Organ-on-chip (OOC), particularly lung-on-chip, is one such approach which combines the potential of microfluidics, cell culture and molecular biology into a single miniaturised platform. The device is realized to be capable of simulating in-vivo physiological responses of an organ. In the current study, an OOC, which is a multichannel 3D cell culture microfluidic device, is made via soft lithography technique, using polydimethylsiloxane-polymer and diverse polymeric porous/semipermeable membranes. Several polymer membranes i.e. PDMS, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nitrocellulose, polyester etc., integrated into the microdevices, were efficiently explored to realize their better cell-adhesion and viability property. We also propose for the application of a simple, smart and cost-effective lung-on-chip platform to study the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in humans, drug toxicity testing and provide insights into antigenâ€“antibody interactions. This platform will enable us to study multiple phenomena at a micro-level generating more reliable data and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.

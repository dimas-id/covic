Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome in infants and young children of unknown etiology, which mainly affects small and medium-sized arteries, particularly the coronary artery. Clinical features include an acute febrile illness associated with mucocutaneous involvements and lymphadenopathy. The coronary aneurysms develop in about 10% to 20% of patients, some of which may cause myocardial infarction or lead to ischemic heart disease. Combinations of high-dose gamma globulin and aspirin are the essential treatments for acute Kawasaki disease patients. Bypass surgery and the catheter intervention are the optional treatments for the coronary artery sequelae of Kawasaki disease. Some patients with coronary artery sequelae may develop into adult coronary artery disease.

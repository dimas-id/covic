BACKGROUND Placement of a primary gastrojejunal tube (GJT) can be technically challenging and often requires an open procedure to negotiate the tube past the duodenal sweep into the jejunum. The alternative approach is to first place a gastrostomy tube (GT), which is then changed to a GJT under endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidance after waiting 6-8 weeks to allow the stoma to mature. We report a case series of primary GJT placement using a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic approach. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement. Patients' demographics and relevant clinical information were analyzed. RESULTS Six patients (4 male, 2 female) were identified. The median age at the time of operation was 30.2 months (range, 28 days-10 years). Five GJTs were successfully placed laparoscopically/endoscopically, and one procedure was converted to open. The mean operative time was 84 minutes (range, 63-102 minutes). Postoperative abdominal radiography confirmed post-pyloric tube position in all patients. Feedings were initiated on the first postoperative day. One intraoperative complication required conversion to an open procedure. No patients developed postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement is technically feasible and an excellent alternative in patients who require transpyloric feeding access.

Lung diseases are common and significant causes of illness and death around the world. Inflammasomes have emerged as an important regulator of lung diseases. The important role of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in the inflammatory response of many lung diseases has been elucidated. The cleavage to turn IL-1 beta and IL-18 from their precursors into the active forms is tightly regulated by inflammasomes. In this chapter, we structurally review current evidence of inflammasome-related components in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic lung diseases, focusing on the “inflammasome-caspase-1-IL-1 beta/IL-18” axis.

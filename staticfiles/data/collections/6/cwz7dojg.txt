COVID-19 is a novel respiratory disease leading to high rates of acute respiratory failure requiring hospital admission. It is unclear if specific patient populations such as lung transplant patients are at higher risk for COVID-19. Some reports suggest that transplant patients may not be at higher risk if proper social distancing and preventive measures are employed. Efforts to ensure the safety of wait-listed patients, transplant recipients, and healthcare workers are underway. Recommendations for the care of lung transplant patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed and will likely change as the pandemic evolves.

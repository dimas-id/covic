As laparoscopic sacral colpopexy is associated with long operation times, barbed suture can be used to reduce the time needed to accomplish peritoneal closure. However, little is known about the adverse events of this new technique. We report on the case of a small bowel volvulus following peritoneal closure using a barbed suture. The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and a bowel obstruction syndrome 1 month after laparoscopic sacral colpopexy.

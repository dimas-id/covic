The ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly throughout China and other countries, and has been characterized as a pandemic. With the strict prevention and control measures implemented by the Chinese government, the spread of the epidemic in China has come under preliminary control by the end of February, 2020, whereas the situation of some countries outside China is not optimistic and raises great public concern. In fighting COVID-19, radiologic examinations played a critical role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19, and could also help assess disease course and severity. There is an urgent need to share useful experience and effective measures internationally. This article outlines the collaborative actions and efforts by the Chinese radiology field and the situation of front-line health care workers in radiology departments to present the world with experiences and examples of Chinese radiology during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Abstract This clinical study covers the care of a Covid-positive patient after she was admitted in a pulmonary rehabilitation centre. The clinical pattern is mainly marked by dyspnea, but also by the psychological trauma caused by impairment and hospitalization in intensive care. The patient's previous quality of life, the lack of comorbidity and a tailored multidisciplinary care will be decisive in her rehabilitation progress.

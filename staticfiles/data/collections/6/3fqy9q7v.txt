BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume is associated with poor outcome after thrombolysis, and it is unclear whether endovascular therapies are beneficial for large DWI lesion. Our aim was to assess the impact of pretreatment DWI lesion volume on outcomes after endovascular therapy, with a special emphasis on patients with complete recanalization. METHODS We analyzed data collected between April 2007 and November 2011 in a prospective clinical registry. All acute ischemic stroke patients with complete occlusion of internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery treated by endovascular therapy were included. DWI lesion volumes were measured by the RAPID software. Favorable outcome was defined by modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 at 90 days. RESULTS A total of 139 acute ischemic stroke patients were included. Median DWI lesion volume was 14 cc (interquartile range, 5-43) after a median onset time to imaging of 110 minutes (interquartile range, 77-178). Higher volume was associated with less favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.96). A complete recanalization was achieved in 65 (47%) patients after a median onset time of 238 minutes (interquartile range, 206-285). After adjustment for volume, complete recanalization was associated with more favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 6.32; 95% confidence interval, 2.90-13.78). After stratification of volume by tertiles, complete recanalization was similarly associated with favorable outcome in the upper 2 tertiles (P<0.005). CONCLUSIONS Our results emphasize the importance of initial DWI volume and recanalization on clinical outcome after endovascular treatment. Large DWI lesions may still benefit from recanalization in selected patients.

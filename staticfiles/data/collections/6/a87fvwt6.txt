Non-hepatotropic viruses cause acute hepatitis and/or acute liver failure, without causing any chronic damage to the liver. These viruses do not primarily target the liver. These viruses include the herpes viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus), parvovirus, adenovirus, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus. The risk of acquiring infection from any of the non-hepatotropic viruses is specific to each virus. Infection with the herpesviruses is ubiquitous, with clinically significant hepatitis being less common. Considerations for determining the risk of hepatitis from non-hepatotropic viruses include prior exposure (risk of reactivation), host immune status (increase severity in immunosuppressed), and duration of infection in the contact. Diagnosis is made with a combination of serology, polymerase chain reaction, or liver biopsy. Treatment is supportive in the majority. In certain clinical scenarios, such as cytomegalovirus infection in transplant patients, and acute liver failure from herpes simplex virus, specific antiviral therapy is warranted.

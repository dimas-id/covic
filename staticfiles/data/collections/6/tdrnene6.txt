Antibacterial materials are recognized as important biomaterials due to their effective inhibition of bacterial infections. Hydrogels are 3D polymer networks crosslinked by either physical interactions or covalent bonds. Currently, hydrogels with an antibacterial function are a main focus in biomedical research. Many advanced antibacterial hydrogels are developed, each possessing unique qualities, namely high water swellability, high oxygen permeability, improved biocompatibility, ease of loading and releasing drugs, and structural diversity. Here, an overview of the structures, performances, mechanisms of action, loading and release behaviors, and applications of various antibacterial hydrogel formulations is provided. Furthermore, the prospects in biomedical research and clinical applications are predicted.

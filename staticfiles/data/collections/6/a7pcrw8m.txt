BACKGROUND Evidence-based recommendations for the expected duration of convalescence after laparoscopic groin hernia repair are not available, and objective reasons for prolonged convalescence are not clear. Our main aim was to establish the expected duration of convalescence using preoperative recommendations to the patient and to identify the limiting factors for early (postoperative) resumption of normal activities after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy (TAPP). METHODS This was a single-center prospective study. The intervention (the recommendation to the patient) was 1 day for convalescence. Several predefined factors were investigated for their influence on the duration of convalescence and the risk of early postoperative pain. Predefined, clinically justified reasons for not resuming normal activities within the first 3 postoperative days were also registered. RESULTS Between August 2009 and August 2010, 185 consecutive male patients with groin hernia were enrolled prospectively, and 162 patients were available for analysis. Convalescences from work and leisure activities were a median of 5 days (range, 1-40) and 3 days (range, 1-49), respectively (P = .34). Preoperative expectations of convalescence from work (the number of days) was the only factor to explain prolonged convalescence from work (P < .001). Postoperative, self-registered planned sick leave, and complaints of pain and fatigue were the dominant reasons for not resuming normal activities within the first 3 days after operation. Younger age was the only factor found to explain the intensity of postoperative pain (P < .001). CONCLUSION Postoperative convalescence (return to work or normal activities) was between 3 and 5 days after TAPP in patients who were counseled about a 1-day expected convalescence. The expectation of convalescence from work was an important reason for delayed convalescence beyond 1 day.

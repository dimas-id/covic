Background: Identification of risk factors of severe Covid-19 is critical for improving therapies and understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Methods: We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. Results: The majority of Covid-19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non-diabetics. Conclusions: Severe Covid-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid-19 suggests a previously unrecognized manifestation of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW In recent years, researchers have been adopting and using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods via technology devices for real-time measurement of exposures and outcomes in HIV research. To assess and critically evaluate how EMA methods are currently being used in HIV research, we systematically reviewed recent published literature (October 2017-October 2019) and searched select conference databases for 2018 and 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Our searches identified 8 published articles that used EMA via smartphone app, a handheld Personal Digital Assistant, and web-based survey programs for real-time measurement of HIV-related exposures and outcomes in behavioral research. Overall trends include use of EMA and technology devices to address substance use, HIV primary prevention (e.g., condom use and preexposure prophylaxis), and HIV treatment (medication adherence). This review supports the use of EMA methods in HIV research and recommends that researchers use EMA methods to measure psychosocial factors and social contexts and with Black and Latinx samples of gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and cisgendered women to reflect current HIV disparities in the U.S.A.

BACKGROUND: Examination of serum lactate level and its changes, as an indicator of tissue oxygenation, as well as level of creatine kinase (CK) inhibitors, as a factor of mortality which partially expresses heart, brain, and muscle damage, may be considered as tools to determine prognosis in critically ill patients. We aimed to evaluate these two factors as potential prognostic factors in critically poisoned patients admitted to our toxicology ICU. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study that was performed on poisoned patients referred to emergency department of Loghman Hakim Hospital. One-hundred critically poisoned patients who had been admitted to ICU were conveniently chosen using a random number table and included into the study after obtaining consent forms from their next of kin. Their serum lactate and CK levels were checked on admission. These levels were compared subsequently between survivors and non-survivors to seek for their potential prognostic role. RESULTS: In a total of 100 patients enrolled, 61 were male. Serum level of lactate (with a cut off of 26 mg/dL) and serum CK with a cutoff point of 169 U/L could have prognosticated death with sensitivity and specificity of 78 and 77% (for lactate) and 74 and 62% (for serum CK), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In poisoned patients, serum lactate and CK can be used as possible prognostic factors because they rapidly increase in the serum and are easily detectable.

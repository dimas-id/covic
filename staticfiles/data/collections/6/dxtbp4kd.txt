The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively controlled. It is of great significance to study the law of cross-regional spread of the epidemic, for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in the future in China and other countries or regions. In this study, the cross-regional connection intensity between cities was characterized based on the probability and the effective distance of the shortest path tree, and the empirical analysis was carried out based on the high-frequency data such as the cases of COVID 19 outbreaks. It is concluded that the higher the intensity of inter-city connection, the larger scale the cross-regional spread of the epidemic.

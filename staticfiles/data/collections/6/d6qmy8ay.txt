Since the discovery of motifs in molecular sequences for real genomic data, research into this phenomenon has attracted increased attention. Motifs are relatively short sequences that are biologically significant. This paper utilises the bioinformatics application of the algorithm outlined in [5], testing it using real genomic data from large sequences. It intends to implement bioinformatics application for real genomic data, in order to discover interesting regions for all maximal motifs, in a sliding window of length â„“, on a sequence x of length n.

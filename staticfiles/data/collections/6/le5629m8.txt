Summary The incidence of multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections (BSIs) increased two- to four-fold in three Israeli hospitals between 1997 and 2002, accounting for 3.5–18% of all hospital-acquired BSIs. This was associated with increasing carbapenem resistance reaching 35–54%, and by a dramatic increase in carbapenem consumption. In-hospital fatality rates ranged between 47% and 58% and were significantly higher than those seen with other nosocomial Gram-negative pathogens. A. baumannii was not restricted to intensive care units, but had spread to all hospital wards. Multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii has the potential to reach endemicity in hospitals and warrants more vigorous and innovative efforts to limit its spread.

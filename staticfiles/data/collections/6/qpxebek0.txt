Infectious disease has killed more people than any other cause throughout history. The current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has again revealed how vulnerable we remain. Muslims constitute the world's second-largest religious group, making up about a quarter of the world population. They have distinctive faith and culture, pertaining to their religious beliefs and practices that need special attention, in situations such as current COVID-19 pandemic. Congregational prayers are an indispensable part of Islamic culture. Performance of obligatory prayers in congregation is compulsory and mandatory for every Muslim adult male who has no excuse for not doing so. But, doing so during a pandemic can help in the spread of the COVID-19. Muslims look up to the Holy Qur'an and teachings of Prophet (PBUH) (Hadiths) for guidance under all the circumstances. In this review we will cover how Islamic teaching can guide us to manage pandemics like COVID-19.

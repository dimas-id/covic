BACKGROUND The Magenstrasse and Mill (M&M) procedure is a vertical gastroplasty creating a tubular pouch extending from the cardia to the antrum. This "incomplete sleeve" avoids gastric resection or band placement. In this paper, we report our experience of the laparoscopic approach of the technique in a selected obese population excluding prominent grazer and/or sweet eaters. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred patients (39 males, 61 females) underwent the procedure in a prospective trial. Mean age was 40 years (range 18-68). Mean preoperative BMI was 43.2 kg/m(2) (range 35-62). RESULTS The procedure was performed by laparoscopy starting with the creation of a circular opening at the junction of antrum and corpus followed by a vertical stapling to the angle of Hiss. Mean duration of the procedure was 67 (range 40-122) min. No intraoperative complication occurred. Mean hospital stay (SD) was 2.5 (0.9) days. The single postoperative complication consisted in a mild stenosis that responded to endoscopic dilatation. After a mean follow-up of 15 months (range 9-24), mean percentage of excess body weight loss (SD) was 48(14), 59(18) and 68(24)%, respectively at 3, 6, and 12 months. Quality of life appeared satisfactory with a low incidence of gastroesophageal reflux. The procedure was associated with improvement or resolution of diabetes, arterial hypertension, and dyslipemia at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS Our experience demonstrated that the M&M procedure could be performed safely laparoscopically. The satisfactory results on weight loss, obesity-associated mordities, and quality of life will need to be confirmed on longer follow-up.

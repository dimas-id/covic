The aggressive nature of the new SARS-2 corona virus now referred to as SARS-CoV-2 ; the seriousness and length of the period of infection; the fast and far-reaching transmissibility via liquid droplets that become air-borne when someone coughs, sneezes or speaks with increasing evidence to support actual airborne transmission; the presence of viral particles especially in body fluids and tissues, of viral positive individuals; and the persistence of the virus on different types of surfaces pose serious concerns for forensic practitioners, including forensic DNA analysts. Many forensic laboratories and law enforcement agencies need to address the inevitable changes that must be made in forensic DNA testing. In this article, we explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the collection, handling, storage and transport of biological samples for downstream DNA testing. This paper aims to open discussions on the urgency of balancing the need to conduct investigations in order to maintain public order with the requirements of effective biosafety protocols specifically formulated to protect human resources within the forensic science community.

Abstract From the outset, Chapter 7 tries to explain what is understood by indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and the various factors that impact it, as well as the best current approaches employed to achieving optimum IEQ. The causes of building-related illness (BRI) and sick building syndrome (SBS), which appear to be on the increase, are explained and analyzed. The chapter also focuses on the need for a building’s interior air quality, as this is one of the most pivotal factors in maintaining building occupants’ safety, productivity, and well-being. Other important factors that are focused on are ventilation and filtration, including air cleaners and ventilation systems. The leading inorganic indoor contaminants are discussed such as asbestos, radon, and lead, exposure to which can create significant health risks. Likewise, organic contaminants including aldehydes, volatile organic compounds/semivolatile organic compounds, and pesticides are examined and analyzed. Several combustion-generated contaminates such as carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides are also looked into. Toward the end of the chapter, the best practices for IEQ are outlined and discussed.

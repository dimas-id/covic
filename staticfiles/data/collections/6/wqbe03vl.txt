Abstract Background Despite the increasing knowledge on the role of viruses in exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), it is less clear which viruses are involved and to what extent they contribute to exacerbations. This review aims to systematically combine and evaluate the available literature of the prevalence of respiratory viruses in patients with AECOPD, detected by PCR. Methods An electronic search strategy was performed on PubMed and Embase and reference lists were screened for eligible studies. Cross-sectional, prospective studies and case-control studies were included. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of respiratory viruses (adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, EBV, hMPV, influenza, parainfluenza, rhino-/enterovirus, RSV) in respiratory secretions of patients during an AECOPD. Secondary outcomes were the odds of the presence of the viruses in different respiratory secretions and the odds of the presence of viruses in upper and lower respiratory tract (URT/LRT) samples. Results Nineteen studies with 1728 patients were included. Rhino-/enteroviruses (16.39%), RSV (9.90%) and influenza (7.83%) were the most prevalent viruses detected with lower detection rates of coronaviruses (4.08%) and parainfluenza (3.35%). Adenovirus (2.07%), hMPV (2.78%) and bocaviruses (0.56%) appear to be rare causative agents of AECOPD. Definitive conclusions regarding the role of EBV cannot be made. Seven of the eight analyzed viruses had a higher prevalence in LRT samples. Coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the URT. Conclusions Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in both URT and LRT samples in AECOPD with rhino-/enteroviruses, RSV and influenza viruses the most prevalent viruses. Detection rates vary between the two sites for different viruses.

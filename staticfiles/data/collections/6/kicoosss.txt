Abstract In order to investigate the genome organization of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) further, cDNA clones covering the region between the nucleocapsid and the spike (S) protein genes were independently constructed and sequenced for the two virulent isolates Br1/87 and CV777. Of the three major ORFs identified, two were found to encode the major and minor coronavirus membrane proteins M and sM. A potentially single ORF, designated ORF3 according to the pattern of the viral subgenomic mRNAs, could be identified between the S and sM genes. A striking variability, essentially generated by short deletions clustered in a few loci, was observed in the ORF3 of both isolates. The largest predicted polypeptide of 223 amino acids showed homology with polypeptides potentially encoded by other members of the same genetic subset, including two shorter polypeptides of human respiratory virus HCV 229E and one of transmissible gastroenteritis virus TGEV. This homology suggests that the two HCV ORFs may have originated from a single precursor. The function of these polypeptides is not known, but the predicted products of the PEDV ORF3 and related ORFs share features suggestive of a membrane-associated protein.

In-vehicle environment is a special indoor environment, which is mobile, either open or closed. This chapter reviewed in-vehicle air quality and passenger exposures for roadway commuters, commercial airplanes, and marine transportation. The sources of pollutants in-vehicle can be categorized as the same as other indoor environments, including outdoor air, human activity, emission from building material and interior furnisher, and biological metabolic process from animals and microbes. However, the exposure in vehicles varies from now and then, influenced by window open/closed, speed, air flow, ventilation on/off, air conditioner on/off, pollutants from ambient outdoor air, interior material, and number of passengers. There are few studies on health condition of passengers, except infectious disease during airway transportation. Some health studies of related occupations are reviewed.

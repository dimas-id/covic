We observed that 0 of 19 patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, including those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), who were hospitalized together and who had close contact with 95 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the same hospital floor contracted SARS, whereas 6 of 28 medical workers who served on this floor contracted SARS while caring for these patients. Our investigation found that most of the patients with HIV-1/AIDS were receiving treatment of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during hospitalization. Coincidentally, a research group from Hong Kong recently reported that patients with SARS who received treatment with the anti-HIV-1 drug lopinavir-ritonavir experienced significantly better clinical outcomes than did those who did not receive lopinavir-ritonavir. On the basis of these observations and studies, we propose that HAART should be considered for patients with SARS and their close contacts when the SARS epidemic reemerges.

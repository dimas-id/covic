Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in the adult population. ARAS may result in progressive renal impairment, renovascular hypertension, and/or cardiac disturbance syndromes. Because medical therapy does not affect the progressive nature of this disease process, more aggressive treatments are needed to definitively treat ARAS. When performed correctly, renal artery stenting has been shown to stabilize or improve renal function and/or renovascular hypertension in 65-70% of carefully selected patients with ARAS. Therefore, percutaneous renal artery stenting should be considered the primary treatment for patients with symptomatic ARAS.

IMPORTANCE: Anatomically, viral density is greater in the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx. It is to be expected that instrumentation in or through those areas will entail a higher risk of transmission. That's why head and neck and otolaryngologist surgeons are among the most vulnerable health professionals. OBSERVATIONS: Surgeons should essentially perform procedures they require. Surgeries should be performed with personal protective equipment suitable for the high risk of aerosolization: goggles, N95 face mask, facial mask, blood-repelling gown and gloves. It is advisable to have the cooperative COVID-19 test in all patients. Telemedicine is a useful resource if resources allow it. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Otolaryngologists and related specialists are among the groups at higher risk when performing surgeries and upper airway examinations. There are no emergencies in a pandemic. The care of health professionals is crucial to combating this health situation.

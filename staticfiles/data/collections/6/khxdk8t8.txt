We report results of our study of approved drugs as potential treatments for COVID 19, based on the application of various bioinformatics predictive methods. The drugs studied include Chloroquine, Ivermectin, Remdesivir and alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DMFO). Our results indicate that these small drug molecules selectively bind to stable, kinetically active residues and residues adjoining them on the surface of proteins and inside protein pockets, and that some prefer hydrophobic over other active sites. Our approach is not restricted to viruses and can facilitate rational drug design, as well as improve our understanding of molecular interactions, in general.

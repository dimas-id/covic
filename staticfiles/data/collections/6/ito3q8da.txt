Even though the infection rate of COVID-19 is very high as of today 31 May: 5,819,962 confirmed cases worldwide, the death rate is only about 6.23%, 362,786 deaths as for the same date. Furthermore, the rate of total infected cases is extremely different from one country to another as well as for the rate of mortality. Therefore, there may be some factors that possibly amplify the rate of infection from one country to another as well as for the rate of mortality due to COVID-19. In the literature, we have found multiple identified risk factors responsible for vulnerability to COVID19, we have chosen pertinent key risk factors for our study: Median-age, age>65 years old, weight, population density, diabetics, International arrivals, median temperature between March and May.

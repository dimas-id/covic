The role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease (KD) remains controversial. In this study, we showed that 8.8% of patients with KD had documented respiratory viral infections. Patients with concomitant viral infections had a higher frequency of coronary artery dilatations and were significantly more often diagnosed with incomplete KD. The presence of a concomitant viral infection should not exclude the diagnosis of KD.

The major source of error in epidemiologic studies of Parkinson’s disease is diagnostic uncertainty. Prevalence varies widely in community-based studies, ranging from 31 per 100,000 persons in Libya to 328 per 100,000 persons in the Par si community in Bombay, India, possibly reflecting the differences in risk factors among the populations studied, in addition to the methodologic differences. Parkinson’s disease is common with advancing age. Heredity may be a risk factor in some cases, and whites may be more susceptible. The many controlled studies examining the increased risk for this disease are discussed.

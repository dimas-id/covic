A 266-bp fragment of cDNA from within gene B, ORF 2a, of MHV-A59 was used to construct a vector encoding a bacterial/viral fusion protein. Antiserum raised against this fusion protein specifically immunoprecipitates a 30K protein from infected 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts. The protein is localized primarily in the cytosol and not in the membranes. This is consistent with its predicted sequence and potential role as an RNA binding protein.

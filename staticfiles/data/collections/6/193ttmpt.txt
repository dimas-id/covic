It was the middle of March when we were two weeks into our clinical rotation and just started to get the hang of the new hospital. When one morning after reaching the hospital and finishing our patient rounds and notes, we received a frantic message from our co-rotator, mentioning all clinical rotations for MD students have been suspended due to COVID-19, according to the new AMA guidelines. We immediately booked our flight tickets and flew back to Mumbai.

Background Preoperative meningioma embolization may be performed with microparticles or liquid embolic agents. The pressure cooker technique (PCT) has recently been described for the embolization of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Case We present the case of a 73-year-old woman with a large frontal interhemispheric meningioma that was successfully preoperatively embolized with the PCT using Squid 12, a new ethyl-vinyl alcohol copolymer embolic agent. The PCT presents considerable advantages relative to conventional embolization techniques such as deeper and faster tumor penetration and embolization of tumors with difficult vascular access, and retrograde feeling of pial afferents may be achieved. Conclusions The use of the PCT with Squid 12 may potentially increase the effectiveness of meningioma embolization, increase tumor devascularization and improve outcomes of surgical resection.

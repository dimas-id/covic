Skeletal muscles, namely, postural muscles, as soleus, suffer from atrophy under disuse. Muscle atrophy development caused by unloading differs from that induced by denervation or other stimuli. Disuse atrophy is supposed to be the result of shift of protein synthesis/proteolysis balance towards protein degradation increase. Maintaining of the balance involves many systems of synthesis and proteolysis, whose activation leads to muscle adaptation to disuse rather than muscle degeneration. Here, we review recent data on activity of signaling systems involved in muscle atrophy development under unloading and muscle adaptation to the lack of support.

A 4-year-old Quarter horse stallion was presented for acute abdominal pain. Exploratory celiotomy revealed a mesenteric diverticulum of the jejunum and mesodiverticular band that were associated with small intestinal strangulation. Resection and anastomosis were performed. A second celiotomy was performed due to adhesions. The horse recovered completely and returned to training.

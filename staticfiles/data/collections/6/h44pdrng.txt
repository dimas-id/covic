Abstract Despite the significance attached to foreign direct investment (FDI) by Multinational enterprises (MNEs), there are is no comprehensive review of the FDI literature. Moreover, those that have been published, focus on subsets of FDI. This review systematically examines the empirical as well as theoretical research on FDI through an analysis of 500 articles published during the last five decades. Theoretical models, methods, context, and contributions to scholarship were reviewed. We strive to highlight the key theories, paradigms, and articles and provide directions for future research. We conclude that FDI has evolved as the most significant area of international business.

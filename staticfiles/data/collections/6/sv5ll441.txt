Hybrid games combine discrete, continuous, and adversarial dynamics. Differential game logic ([Image: see text]) enables proving (classical) existence of winning strategies. We introduce constructive differential game logic (CdGL) for hybrid games, where proofs that a player can win the game correspond to computable winning strategies. This constitutes the logical foundation for synthesis of correct control and monitoring code for safety-critical cyber-physical systems. Our contributions include novel semantics as well as soundness and consistency.

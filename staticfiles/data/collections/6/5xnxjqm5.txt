Collectins are collagen-containing C-type (calcium-dependent) lectins which are important pathogen pattern recognising innate immune molecules. Their primary structure is characterised by an N-terminal, triple-helical collagenous region made up of Gly-X-Y repeats, an a-helical coiled-coil trimerising neck region, and a C-terminal C-type lectin or carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Further oligomerisation of this primary structure can give rise to more complex and multimeric structures that can be seen under electron microscope. Collectins can be found in serum as well as in a range of tissues at the mucosal surfaces. Mannanbinding lectin can activate the complement system while other members of the collectin family are extremely versatile in recognising a diverse range of pathogens via their CRDs and bring about effector functions designed at the clearance of invading pathogens. These mechanisms include opsonisation, enhancement of phagocytosis, triggering superoxidative burst and nitric oxide production. Collectins can also potentiate the adaptive immune response via antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells through modulation of cytokines and chemokines, thus they can act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity. This chapter describes the structure-function relationships of collectins, their diverse functions, and their interaction with viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.

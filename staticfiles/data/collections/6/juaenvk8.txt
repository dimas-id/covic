In this study, We report on the use of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan examinations for the diagnosis of COVID-19 respiratory syndrome in asymptomatic left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients. Thus, extreme caution and thoughtful approaches should be taken for a timely detection in delicate LVAD populations, especially if patients are living in a high-density COVID-19-infected area, and the potential intention for LVAD treatment is bridge to transplantation.

AIM: The association of transporters gene polymorphisms with chloroquine/primaquine malaria treatment response was investigated in a Brazilian population. PATIENTS & METHODS: Totally, 164 Plasmodium vivax malaria infected patients were included. Generalized estimating equations were performed to determine gene influences on parasitemia and/or gametocytemia clearance over treatment time. RESULTS: Significant interaction between SLCO2B1 genotypes and treatment over time for parasitemia clearance rate on day 2 were observed (p (FDR) = 0.002). SLCO1A2 and SLCO1B1 gene treatment over time interactions were associated with gametocytemia clearance rate (p (FDR) = 0.018 and p (FDR) = 0.024). ABCB1, ABCC4 and SLCO1B3 were not associated with treatment response. CONCLUSION: The present work presents the first pharmacogenetic report of an association between chloroquine/primaquine responses with OATP transporters.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded positive-sense enveloped RNA viruses. Among RNA viruses, CoVs have the largest genome. CoVs infect diverse animal species including domestic and wild animals. In this chapter, we provide a brief review on animal CoVs by discussing their receptor, host specificity, reverse genetics, and emerging and re-emerging porcine CoVs.

INTRODUCTION We employed a safe approach during laparoscopic splenectomy by first mobilizing the pancreatic tail and then dissecting the splenic vessels at the splenic hilum before mobilizing the spleen. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE Patients were placed in the lithotomy position, and only the upper body was twisted to the right side. Five trocars were placed. After the bursa omentalis was opened, an avascular layer was identified behind the pancreas. This avascular layer was bluntly dissected, and the pancreatic tail was isolated from the retroperitoneum. The tissue surrounding the splenic hilum was dissected by a handling tape that was placed around the pancreatic tail. Because the spleen remained connected to the retroperitoneum with the splenorenal ligament, a good operative view of the splenic hilum was obtained with proper extension. After sufficient space was secured between the pancreatic tail and the spleen, the splenic vessels were divided with a linear stapler. The spleen was detached in the final stage. DISCUSSION The current standardized procedure is highly recommended for a safe laparoscopic splenectomy.

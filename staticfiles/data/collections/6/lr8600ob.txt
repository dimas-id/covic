OBJECTIVES To describe a technique using bipolar electrosurgical forceps for haemostasis during open ovariectomy of bitches and queens and for castration of dogs and to determine whether these forceps reduced surgical time compared to ligation with suture. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bipolar electrosurgical forceps were used for haemostasis in 3744 open surgeries including ovariectomies in bitches (n=1406) and queens (n=859) and castrations in dogs (n=1335). The forceps were also used to assist with ovariohysterectomy in bitches (n=89) and queens (n=55). The effect of bipolar electrocoagulation and other likely factors influencing surgical time was examined using linear regression analysis of 367 surgeries. RESULTS The use of the forceps reduced surgical time by 9·7 ±2·8 minutes in bitches and by 3·0 ±1·5 minutes in queens. The complications encountered initially were small superficial skin burns requiring topical treatment and one case of haemorrhage associated with surgical technique. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Bipolar electrosurgical forceps reduce surgical time in ovariectomies, and complications are rare. This technique has promise for widespread application in veterinary practice to assist with haemostasis in ovariectomy of bitches and queens.

A case of intestinal adenocarcinoma with metastases to the pancreas and regional lymph node was found in a 9-year-old, captive female cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) with intermittent diarrhea. At necropsy, the tumor mass was located in the ileo-cecal junction causing circumferential thickening and annular stenosis. Microscopically, the lesions at primary and metastatic sites showed typical features of mucinous adenocarcinoma as seen in humans, including intracellular and extracellular mucin production and characteristic appearance of a signet ring of the tumor cells. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological evaluation, positive cytokeratin immunostain, and mucin production demonstrated by PAS and Alcian blue stain. It is speculated that the development of intestinal carcinoma was partly attributable to the excessive absorption of a diet of refined food, unbalanced nutrition, and the nature of these animals to develop stress easily.

BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV­2 pandemic has led worldwide to substantial limitations in healthcare systems. This article describes the recent developments and measures from March through May 2020, which have contributed to the maintenance of ophthalmological care at in-patient departments of ophthalmology. METHODS: PubMed literature search, own data, interhospital survey. RESULTS: The rapid implementation of infection and hygiene control measures and adaptation of standard operating procedures (SOP) to minimize the risk of infection, along with prioritized urgent and emergency care combined with postponement of elective procedures enabled the continuous care of ophthalmological patients. CONCLUSION: Despite the challenge of a significant shift of medical resources during the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic, medically urgently necessary ophthalmological treatments are continuously provided by maximum care clinics; however, based on currently available data, it cannot be ruled out whether treatment of emergency patients was delayed during the pandemic.

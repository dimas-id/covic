Abstract We present a case of severe pneumonia, associated with a prolonged infection by a species C rhinovirus (HRV) in a 3-week old neonate. HRV RNA was identified in nasal and nasopharyngeal secretions, bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial specimens, stool and urine, collected from the patient during a one-month period. No other viral or bacterial agents were detected. Sequence analysis of two regions of the viral genome, amplified directly from the clinical specimens revealed a novel HRV-C variant. These observations highlight the occurrence of severe neonatal infections caused by HRVs and the need of rapid viral diagnostics for their detection.

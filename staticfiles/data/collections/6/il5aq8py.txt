Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect both adults and children. Although the disease, named COVID-19, has a lower prevalence in infancy and has been described as mild, the clinical characteristics may vary and there is a possibility of complications. Objectives: To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric cases confirmed in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, during the first three months of the pandemic, and of children admitted with COVID-19 to a secondary hospital. Methods: This case series includes all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR testing, identified in the state epidemiological surveillance system between March 1 and May 31, 2020. Confirmed patients admitted to the Sinaloa Pediatric Hospital (HPS) during the same dates are also described. Results: Fifty one children with SARS-CoV-2 were included, 10 of the admitted to HPS. The median age was 10 years. The more frequent symptoms were fever (78%), cough (67%) and headache (57%). Most cases were mild or asymptomatic. Three patients with comorbidities died. Only 4 of 10 patients identified in HPS had been admitted with the diagnosis of possible COVID-19. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children was mostly mild or asymptomatic, but with a wide range of clinical presentations.

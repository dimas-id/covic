Clinical presentation of COVID-19 is common to other respiratory infections. We compared the characteristics at hospital admission of confirmed and not-confirmed COVID-19 patients, in the early phase of the epidemic. Thirty-seven suspected patients were enrolled, and COVID-19 was confirmed in 17. Confirmed patients are older, have more frequently contact with confirmed cases. Distinctive clinical characteristics among COVID-19 were the grand-glass opacities at CT scan, and a pO2/FiO2 ratio less than 250. In not-confirmed group, Influenza represented the most frequent alternative diagnosis. This study contributes to highlight the characteristics to consider at hospital admission in order to promptly suspect COVID-19.

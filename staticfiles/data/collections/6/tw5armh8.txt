Abstract The effects of a number of vaccination strategies on the spread of an SIR type disease are numerically investigated for several common network topologies including random, scale-free, small world, and meta-random networks. These strategies, namely, prioritized, random, follow links and contact tracing, are compared across networks using extensive simulations with disease parameters relevant for viruses such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09. Two scenarios for a network SIR model are considered. First, a model with a given transmission rate is studied. Second, a model with a given initial growth rate is considered, because the initial growth rate is commonly used to impute the transmission rate from incidence curves and to predict the course of an epidemic. Since a vaccine may not be readily available for a new virus, the case of a delay in the start of vaccination is also considered in addition to the case of no delay. It is found that network topology can have a larger impact on the spread of the disease than the choice of vaccination strategy. Simulations also show that the network structure has a large effect on both the course of an epidemic and the determination of the transmission rate from the initial growth rate. The effect of delay in the vaccination start time varies tremendously with network topology. Results show that, without the knowledge of network topology, predictions on the peak and the final size of an epidemic cannot be made solely based on the initial exponential growth rate or transmission rate. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the topology of realistic contact networks when evaluating vaccination strategies.

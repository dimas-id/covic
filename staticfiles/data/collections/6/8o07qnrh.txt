Background: Lowered yields of virus-induced interferon (IFN) by leukocyte cultures were previously suggested to be associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children (Pitkäranta et al. (1993) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 1, 101–108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3–12-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.

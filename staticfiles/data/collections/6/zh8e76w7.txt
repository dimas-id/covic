Since their compositions remain uncertain, universal pandemic vaccines are yet to be created. They would aim to protect globally against pandemic influenza viruses that have not yet evolved. Thus they differ from seasonal vaccines to influenza virus, which are updated annually in spring to incorporate the latest circulating viruses, and are then produced and delivered before the peak influenza season starts in late fall and winter. The efficacy of seasonal vaccines is linked to their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which provide subtype-specific protection against influenza A viruses. If pandemic vaccines were designed to resemble current vaccines in terms of composition and mode of action, they would have to be developed, tested, and mass-produced after the onset of a pandemic, once the causative virus had been identified. The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable. Alternatively, the scientific community could step up efforts to generate a universal vaccine against influenza A viruses that provides broadly cross-reactive protection through the induction of antibodies or T cells to conserved regions of the virus.

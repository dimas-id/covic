The term “epidemiology” was originally used for the science of major, humanity-threatening diseases. Today, it refers to the science of all transmissible and non-transmissible diseases in a population, irrespective of whether they occur frequently in time or space. In the field of microbiology, epidemiology deals with diseases which are caused by transmissible agents such as bacteria, viruses or prions, and in particular with the spread and consequences of infections. Therefore, epidemiological studies are very important for the health of the world population, and are the basis for general and veterinary measures such as quarantine or vaccinations to prevent and control pandemics and epidemics. Furthermore, they allow the development of guidelines and regulations for vaccinations and other measures that prevent infections.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of imaging-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of Bosniak category III and IV cystic renal lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our database was searched to assemble a cohort of biopsy-proven malignant Bosniak category III and IV cystic renal lesions that were treated with imaging-guided percutaneous RFA from 2004 to 2012. The clinical history, imaging features, procedural complications, pathologic results, imaging follow-up, and clinical outcomes of each case were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 16 patients and 23 biopsy-proven malignant cystic renal lesions were included; two patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome had four and three treated lesions each, and a patient with multiple renal tumors had three treated lesions. The other 13 patients each had a single lesion. Clinical follow-up ranged from 2 to 110 months (average, 24 months). The primary treatment efficacy of RFA was 91% (21/23 lesions), and the secondary treatment efficacy was 96% (22/23 lesions). A minority of patients experienced partial loss of renal function. There were no complications related to bleeding or tumor seeding. CONCLUSION Imaging-guided percutaneous RFA is safe and effective for the treatment of Bosniak category III and IV cystic renal lesions.

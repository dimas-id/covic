Emerging viral pathogens cause substantial morbidity and pose a severe threat to health worldwide. However, a universal antiviral strategy for producing safe and immunogenic inactivated vaccines is lacking. Here, we report an antiviral strategy using the novel singlet oxygen ((1)O(2))-generating agent LJ002 to inactivate enveloped viruses and provide effective protection against viral infection. Our results demonstrated that LJ002 efficiently generated (1)O(2) in solution and living cells. Nevertheless, LJ002 exhibited no signs of acute toxicity in vitro or in vivo. The (1)O(2) produced by LJ002 oxidized lipids in the viral envelope and consequently destroyed the viral membrane structure, thus inhibiting the viral and cell membrane fusion necessary for infection. Moreover, the (1)O(2)-based inactivated pseudorabies virus (PRV) vaccine had no effect on the content of the viral surface proteins. Immunization of mice with LJ002-inactiviated PRV vaccine harboring comparable antigen induced more neutralizing antibody responses and efficient protection against PRV infection than conventional formalin-inactivated vaccine. Additionally, LJ002 inactivated a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. Together, our results may provide a new paradigm of using broad-spectrum, highly effective inactivants functioning through (1)O(2)-mediated lipid oxidation for developing antivirals that target the viral membrane fusion process.

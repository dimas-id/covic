BACKGROUND A series of recent cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, was caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV, also called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2]. The World Health Organization officially named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the global spread of COVID-19, similar cases have appeared in other areas of China, and there are a few reports of pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE SUMMARY A 7-year-old girl was diagnosed with COVID-19 and presented with irregular fever, sore throat and diarrhea. Chest computed tomography revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities in multiple areas. The lesions were mainly distributed in the bronchial bundles or subpleural areas of both lungs, particularly in the right lower lobe. The patient also presented with diarrhea, mild kidney injury, and live coronavirus was found in her feces. She was given antiviral agents (lopinavir and ritonavir), and follow-up detection showed that these abnormalities were markedly decreased within 3 d. CONCLUSION The clinical symptoms and prognosis of COVID-19 in pediatric patients may be different from those in adult patients, and the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered.

Abstract The notion that Type I interferons (interferon-α and -β) possess anti-inflammatory potential is supported by data from clinical application in multiple sclerosis, by studies on cultured immune-competent cells and by investigation of experimental diseases in whole animals. These observations deserve the attention of virologists for their potential role in the pathogenesis and clinical management of virus infections.

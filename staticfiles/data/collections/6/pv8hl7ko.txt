Of all the late complications of diabetes, those involving the foot have traditionally required more face-to-face patient visits to clinics to treat wounds by debridement, offloading, and many other treatment modalities. The advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted not only in the closing of most outpatient clinics for face-to-face consultations but also in the inability to perform most laboratory and imaging investigations. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the delivery of care for those with diabetic foot ulcers. The approaches to this challenge in two centers with an interest in diabetic foot disease, including virtual consultations using physician-to-patient and physician-to-home nurse telemedicine as well as home podiatry visits, are described in this review and are illustrated by several case vignettes. The outcomes from these two centers suggest that we may be witnessing new possibilities in models of care for the diabetic foot.

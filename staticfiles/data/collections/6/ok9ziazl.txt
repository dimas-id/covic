During the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, preventing exportation of the disease posed many challenges for economically more developed countries. In Israel, although the risk of importing single cases was assumed to be low, the implications of local transmission were great. This article describes the EVD preparedness plan of the Israeli Ministry of Health. Key elements were a sensitive case definition, designation of a single treatment centre for suspected and confirmed cases, construction of a mobile unit using customised negative-pressure tents and a vigorous national training programme. There were no patients with EVD in Israel, but a few suspected cases were assessed. The Israeli plan may provide a template for emergency infectious disease response in other geographically small countries.

Pandemic enveloped RNA Novel Corona Virus' 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) appears as a beating reed which induce overwhelming outbreak all over the world since November 2019 to till date. Inherent Immunity developed by traditional food habit, exposure to various antigens and vitamin D induced sunlight exposure. Meteorological parameters are the important factors which influencing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) like infectious disease. Aim of this review to enhance our knowledge and explore the association among build up immunity, weather parameters and Corona virus disease (COVID-19) death. In this review we emphasize role of meteorological factor included degree of sun exposure and effect of temperature on enveloped lipid bi-layer structure of Novel corona virus. These meteorological factors and inherent immunity may have impact on SARS-CoV-2 incidence among South East Asian including Bangladeshi. In summary, this study suggests that temperature-humidity variation, inherent immunity and lower life expectancy of South East Asia may be important.

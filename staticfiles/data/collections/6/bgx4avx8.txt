Here, we provide an extensive overview of all reported COVID-19 cases in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in the Netherlands between 27 February and 9 June 2020, gathered by the Dutch MS Taskforce of the Netherlands Society of Neurology. A total of 86 MS patients were reported, 43 of whom tested positive for COVID-19. Of 43 patients who tested positive, 22 patients were hospitalized. Three intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and four deaths were reported. Our findings show no apparent difference in disease-modifying treatment (DMT) use and COVID-19 disease course in Dutch MS patients. In addition, a clear link between low lymphocyte count and severe disease was not observed.

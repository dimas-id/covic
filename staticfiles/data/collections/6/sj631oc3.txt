This paper is a compressed summary of some principal definitions and concepts in the approach to the black box algebra being developed by the authors [6â€“8]. We suggest that black box algebra could be useful in cryptanalysis of homomorphic encryption schemes [11], and that homomorphic encryption is an area of research where cryptography and black box algebra may benefit from exchange of ideas.

The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), has led to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) To date, no drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19 Although the association between Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin efficacy lack of solid evidence-base, several governments have adopted it for all virology confirmed Covid-19 cases even for those who are asymptomatic In the following, we aim to discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the use of this treatment association We mainly tried to discuss the following controversial questions: Is it ethical not to treat a patient while a treatment exists and is used for other indications than Covid-19 for which it’s not proven yet? If yes, is a randomized controlled trial to prove the hydroxychloroquine for the Covid-19 treatment, necessary, in the context of covid-19 pandemic? If No, is it the government’s right to decide the hydroxychloroquine treatment for all covid-19 patients? and what should be the physicians’ attitudes? Finally, what are the government, physicians, and patient’s rights and responsibilities? The paper conclude that, since health authorities in some countries recommended this off-label use treatment, physicians are challenged by the requirement of veracity while providing care to their patients and the implications of such a requirement;they are facing the challenge of balancing this guideline and their own conviction Furthermore, the fundamental principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, and respect for persons should underlie any reflection process to address this dilemma In addition, in a pandemic context, the limits between the government’s, practitioner’s and patient’s rights and obligations are not clear which could significantly endanger the universal ethical principles in clinical practice It could also undermine any attempt to develop serious clinical trials to prove the considered off-label drug

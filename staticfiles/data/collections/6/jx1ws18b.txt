The use of corticosteroids has been controversial in viral pneumonia. In most cases, application of methylprednisolone in severe and critical viral pneumonia patients can quickly alleviate the symptoms of dyspnea and prevent disease progression. However, some scholars have confirmed that corticosteroids delayed the body's clearance of the virus. In our retrospective non‐randomised study, 34 patients under 50 years old and diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) were included, according to given methylprednisolone treatment (n = 18) or not (n = 16), they were separated into 2 groups. By comparing the clinical data we concluded that corticosteroids therapy can effectively release COVID‐19 symptoms such as persistent fever and difficult breathing, improve oxygenation and prevent disease progression. However, it can prolong the negative conversion of nucleic acids. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

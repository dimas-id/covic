BACKGROUND Information is lacking about the severity of complications in children with influenza admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in the UK. In this study, we report risk factors for mortality, invasive ventilation and use of vasoactive drugs for children admitted to PICU with influenza. METHODS We evaluated all admissions to PICUs in England for resident children with a recorded influenza diagnosis between September 2003 and March 2015. We used the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database linked to hospital admission records to identify influenza cases, and high-risk comorbidities among admitted children. We used mixed effects logistic regression models to determine risk factors for mortality, use of invasive ventilation and vasoactive drugs. RESULTS We identified 1961 influenza-related PICU admissions in 1778 children. Children with high-risk conditions accounted for 1540 admissions (78.5%). The odds of mortality were significantly higher for girls than boys (adjusted odds ratio 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.31, 2.79), children from Asian/Asian British (2.70; 1.74, 4.20) or other minority ethnic groups (3.95; 1.65, 9.42) compared to white British children, and significantly increased before and during the A(H1N1)pdm 2009 pandemic compared to the post-pandemic period. Children required invasive ventilation in 1588 admissions (81.0%), and received vasoactive drugs in 586 admissions (29.9%). CONCLUSIONS Nearly four fifths of influenza-related PICU admissions occurred in children with high-risk conditions, highlighting the burden of severe influenza in this vulnerable population Further research is required to explain sex and ethnic group differences in PICU mortality among children admitted with influenza.

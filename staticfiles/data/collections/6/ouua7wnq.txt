• Increased incidence of venous thrombosis has been demonstrated in SARS-CoV2 infected patients but no data are available for arterial thrombosis. • We observed very severe arterial thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular history despite the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, including five irreversible lower limb ischemia and two thoracic aortic free floating thrombi. • Three patients were in intensive care unit (ICU) and two of them also presented VTE, one deep vein thrombosis and one segmental PE. • Further studies are needed to evaluate the necessity of therapeutic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease or thrombophilia.

Medical science and patient care have historically focused on male patients. Many diagnoses in women are still undetermined and it takes several years longer to establish comparable diagnoses in women as in men. Women live longer and have more unhealthy years with ageing than men. Sociocultural aspects vary importantly between the genders and have a different impact on health, wellbeing and many diseases. We still have a long way to go to achieve gender equality and equal rights for women worldwide. Female values, such as creativity, empathy, mutual connection and emotional skills, are eminent in healthcare. Efforts to establish more highly respected and leading positions for women working in the health sector will be a great incentive to put women's health higher on the agenda.

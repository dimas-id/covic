The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted new interest among anesthesiologists and intensivists in controlling coughing and expectoration of potentially infectious aerosolized secretions during intubation and extubation. However, the fear of provoking laryngospasm may cause avoidance of deep or sedated extubation techniques which could reduce coughing and infection risk. This fear may be alleviated with clear understanding of the mechanisms and effective management of post-extubation airway obstruction including laryngospasm. We review the dynamic function of the larynx from the vantage point of head-and-neck surgery, highlighting two key concepts: 1. The larynx is a complex organ that may occlude reflexively at levels other than the true vocal folds; 2. The widely held belief that positive-pressure ventilation by mask can “break” laryngospasm is not supported by the otorhinolaryngology literature. We review the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction after extubation, discuss techniques for achieving smooth extubation with avoidance of coughing and expectoration of secretions, and recommend, on the basis of this review, a clinical pathway for optimal management of upper airway obstruction including laryngospasm to avoid adverse outcomes.

BACKGROUND Nephroureterectomy is the standard of care for transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) involving the upper urinary tract. However, few published case reports exist describing the surgical treatment of ectopic kidneys with TCC. Surgical removal of a pelvic kidney can be complicated by aberrant vasculature supply, a tortuous ureter and abutting anatomical structures. Thus, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate surgical technique for treatment of pelvic kidneys with suspected malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION A 65-year-old female who presented with hematuria and lower abdominal pain was found to have a right pelvic kidney with a heterogeneous mass on computed tomography (CT) urogram. A robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy of the right pelvic kidney was performed. Histopathological analysis revealed high-grade TCC with microscopic extension through the muscularis propria of the renal pelvis and superficially into the renal parenchyma. CONCLUSION This case demonstrates the successful use of robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy in the treatment of a pelvic kidney with TCC. Preoperative CT angiography is critical to define vascular anatomy and to prevent significant blood loss and damage to surrounding structures during surgery. This case was presented because TCC of a pelvic kidney is a rare occurrence and the use of robot-assisted nephroureterectomy for treatment of this disease is novel.

Abstract Doughnut-shaped particles, 55â€“65 nm in diameter, were revealed by electron microscopy in the cisterns of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of cells from an active lesion in autopsied brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient. The morphology of the particles closely resembled that of coronaviruses.

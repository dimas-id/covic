Avascular necrosis tends to occur in the talus because of poor blood supply caused by the extended coverage to the articular cartilage on its surface. Treatment is conservative in the earlier stage of this disease; however, surgical treatment is usually indicated in the advanced stage. Nonunion, leg length discrepancy, or hindfoot instability may occur in patients treated with ankle or tibio-talo-calcaneal fusion. Arthroplasty using a customized total talar prosthesis designed using the computed tomography image of contralateral talus has the potential advantages of weightbearing in the earlier postoperative phase, prevention of lower extremity discrepancy, and maintenance of joint function.

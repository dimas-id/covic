Kidney transplant recipients may be at particular risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection with poor outcomes.1 In a recent case report 2 it was hypothesised that kidney transplant recipients on maintenance belatacept, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) fusion protein, have a milder disease course due to belatacept mitigating the cytokine storm and resultant acute respiratory distress syndrome which have been linked to severity of COVID-19. 3 Here we present the first reported case in the United Kingdom of a kidney transplant patient on belatacept who on the contrary developed a severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care admission and intubation.

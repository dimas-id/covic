The outbreak of the infection of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID­‐19) has become a challenging public health threat worldwide. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID‐19 pneumonia. We report a case of a convalescing pregnant woman diagnosed with COVID‐19 infection 37 days before delivery in the third trimester. A live birth without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection was performed successfully via the vagina. The findings from our case indicate that there is no intrauterine transmission in this woman who developed COVID‐19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

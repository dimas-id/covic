The role of personalized ventilation (PV) in protecting against airborne disease transmission between occupants was evaluated by considering two scenarios with different PV alignments. The possibility that PV may facilitate the transport of exhaled pathogens was explored by performing experiments with droplets and applying PV to a source or/and a target manikin. The risk of direct and indirect exposure to droplets in the inhalation zone of the target was estimated, with these exposure types defined according to their different origins. The infection risk of influenza A, a typical disease transmitted via air, was predicted based on a dose-response model. Results showed that the flow interactions between PV and the infectious exhaled flow would facilitate airborne transmission between occupants in two ways. First, application of PV to the source caused more than 90% of indirect exposure of the target. Second, entrainment of the PV jet directly from the infectious exhalation increased direct exposure of the target by more than 50%. Thus, these scenarios for different PV application modes indicated that continuous exposure to exhaled influenza A virus particles for 2 h would correspond with an infection probability ranging from 0.28 to 0.85. These results imply that PV may protect against infection only when it is maintained with a high ventilation efficiency at the inhalation zone, which can be realized by reduced entrainment of infectious flow and higher clean air volume. Improved PV design methods that could maximize the positive effects of PV on disease control in the human microenvironment are discussed.

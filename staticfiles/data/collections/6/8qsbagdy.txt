Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory tract infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. As of this report, there were 3 probable SARS cases in I-Lan County. Of them, 1 was deceased in another hospital and the remaining 2 were cured and discharged. This report describes the clinical manifestations of the 2 surviving probable cases. The first case had a travel history to Guangdong province, China, and the second case probably contracted the disease from a hospital outbreak. They both developed infiltrations over uni- or bilateral lungs but recovered without intubations. Their treatment modalities included empirical antibiotics, steroids, and anti-viral agents. As SARS becomes an emerging infectious disease in the 21st century, its clinical manifestations and treatment will be discussed.

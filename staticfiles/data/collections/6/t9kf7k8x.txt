Serum from 72 wild coyotes (Canis latrans) in southeastern Colorado (USA) was collected and analyzed for prevalence of antibody to canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) from 1985 to 1988. The prevalence of antibodies to CPV and CDV was 71% and 57%, respectively, for the 4 yr of the study. Prevalence of antibody to CPV did not differ among years, between sexes, or with age. Prevalence of antibody to CDV did not differ among years or between sexes, but was significantly higher in adults (62%) than juveniles (33%). Prevalence of antibodies against CPV and CDV in southeastern Colorado was comparable to results reported in other serologic surveys in the western United States.

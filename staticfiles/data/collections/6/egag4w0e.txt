With the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the amount of used personal protective equipment (PPE) including face masks and protective clothes has significantly increased. This used PPE in a hospital can lead to the indirect infection by COVID-19. Accordingly, it has been recognized that the management of used PPE is very important to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Through the experience of spreading some infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus in South Korea (Republic of Korea), a safe management method of waste related to infectious diseases has been developed. In addition, regarding waste related to COVID-19, the Ministry of Environment, SK, proposed special measures to strengthen the management process of waste related to COVID-19 based on principles such as sustainability, transparency and safety.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is stretching medical resources internationally, including creating ventilator shortages that complicate clinical and ethical situations. The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns. This simulation study explores patient compatibility and ventilator settings during multi-patient ventilation without the use of flow compensating resistances. Methods: A whole-body computational physiology model was used to simulate each patient on a ventilator. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. In addition to mechanical ventilation parameters, the full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. Findings: These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and endtidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 cmH2O/mL, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. Interpretation: In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages. While single-patient ventilation is preferable, if unavailable, these simulations provide a conceptual framework for clinical patient selection guidelines if ventilator sharing is the only available alternative.

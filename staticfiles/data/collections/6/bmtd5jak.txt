OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of LigaSure Forced Triad to create intestinal anastomosis in an ex vivo porcino model. METHODS Colon samples (n = 100) were prospectively randomized into 2 groups: LigaSure group (n = 90) and Stapler group (n = 10). The LigaSure group was divided into 9 subgroups, each of 10 samples, according to the different power levels of the LigaSure system (Bar 1, Bars 2, and Bars 3) and radiofrequency application (1 application, 2 applications, and 3 applications) used. All anastomoses were tested for early burst pressure. The LigaSure subgroup having the highest burst pressure was compared with the Stapler group. Finally, the specimen was reviewed by the same pathologist. RESULTS The burst pressures of the 9 subgroups of LigaSure segments were the following: 29.7 ± 4.5 (Subgroup a); 27.4 ± 3.1 (Subgroup b); 25.3 ± 4 (Subgroup c); 32.9 ± 2.3 (Subgroup d); 30.7 ± 3.8 (Subgroup e); 25.7 ± 4.8 (Subgroup f); 42 ± 4.7 (Subgroup g); 31.8 ± 3.8 (Subgroup h); and 28.5 ± 3 (Subgroup j). Subgroup g (3 bars-power levels/1 frequency application) had the highest burst pressure (P < .001; ANOVA test). No significant difference was found between burst pressure of Subgroup g and Stapler group (42 ± 4.7 vs 42 ± 4.3, respectively, P = .9). On histological view, the LigaSure anastomosis was formed by collagen sealed without cavitation defects. CONCLUSIONS Our study seems to confirm the feasibility of creating intestinal anastomosis using LigaSure. However, further researches in in vivo models are mandatory before recommending its clinical usage in such settings.

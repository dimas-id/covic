The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The different national governments have problems evaluating the reach of the epidemic, having limited resources and tests at their disposal. Hence, any means to evaluate the number of persons with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 with reasonable level of accuracy is useful. In this paper we present the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project. The objective of this project is the collection and publication of data concerning the number of people that show symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in different countries using open anonymous surveys. While this data may be biased, we conjecture that it is still useful to estimate the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus at a given point in time in these countries, and the evolution of this number over time. We show here the initial results of the @CoronaSurveys project in Spain and Portugal.

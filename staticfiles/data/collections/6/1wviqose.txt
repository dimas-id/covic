We demonstrate a series of studies of semantic predications from Semantic MEDLINE, including the detection of semantic predications with burstness and in association with conflict, contradictory, or other sources of uncertainties of scientific knowledge. Semantic networks of predications are analyzed within the framework of structural variations. Examples in this chapter represent scientific knowledge at a level of granularity that differs from those studies of scientific knowledge at the level of articles or journals of scholarly communication.

This paper focuses on viral decontamination by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation technologies. This work develops an efficient and rapid computational method to simulate a UV pulse in order to ascertain the decontamination efficacy of UV irradiation for a surface. It is based on decomposition of a pulse into a group of rays, which are then tracked as they progress towards the target contact surface. The algorithm computes the absorption at the point of contact and color codes it relative to the incoming irradiation. This allows one to quickly quantify the decontamination efficacy across the topology of a structure.

The scope of a healthcare institution's infection prevention and control/healthcare epidemiology program (IPC/HE) should be driven by the size and complexity of the patient population served, that population's risk for healthcare-associated infection (HAI), and local, state, and national regulatory and accreditation requirements. Essential activities of all IPC/HE programs include but are not limited to the following: ∙ Surveillance.∙ Performance improvement to reduce HAI ∙ Acute event response, including outbreak investigation ∙ Education and training of both healthcare personnel and patients ∙ Reporting of HAI to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network as well as entities required by law.

Viral gastroenteritis is extremely common, causing millions of cases of diarrhea in all age groups worldwide. Norovirus has been identified as the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in the adult population.

Mild disease requires symptomatic treatment alone. Complicated cases develop severe dehydration and hypovolemia, requiring the skills of critical care nurses to meet the challenges of care. This article addresses diagnosis and prevention strategies.

In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral therapies, symptomatic and respiratory support is the current standard of therapy. Measures to prevent further transmission have been enacted globally including social distancing and cancellation of public events. Given elevated viral load in the upper aerodigestive tract, extra precautions in patients with otolaryngology needs have been recommended for protection of both healthcare workers and patients.

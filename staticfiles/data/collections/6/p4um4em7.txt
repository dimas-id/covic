BACKGROUND/AIMS We are evaluated technique of anatomic major and minor hepatic resections using suprahilar-extrafascial dissection of Glissonean pedicle with vascular stapling device for transection of hepatic vessels intending to minimize operative time, and blood loss. METHODOLOGY We prospectively analyzed the clinical records of 170 patients who underwent hepatic resection by suprahilar-extrafascial pedicle isolation and stapling technique in our clinic for emergency surgery in Belgrade. Patients who underwent hilar extrahepatic intrafascial dissection were excluded from the study. RESULTS We performed 102 minor liver resections and 68 major hepatectomies. The minor liver resections were associated with significantly shorter surgery duration (95.1±31.1 vs. 186.6±56.5) and transection time (35.9±14.5 vs. 65.3±17.2) than major hepatectomies (P<0.001 for all). The mean blood loss was 255.6±129.9 mL in minor resection and 385.7±200.1 mL in major resection (P=0.003). The mean blood transfusion requirement was 300.8±99.5 mL for the patients with minor hepatectomy and 450.9±89.6 mL for those with major liver resection (P=0.067). There was no significant difference in morbidity and mortality between the groups (P=0.989; P=0.920). Major as well as minor liver resection were a superior oncologic operation with no significant difference in the 3-year overall survival rates. CONCLUSIONS Extrafascial dissection of Glissonean pedicle with vascular stapling represents both an effective and safe surgical technique of anatomical liver resection. Presented approach allows early and easy ischemic delineation of appropriate anatomical liver territory to be removed (hemiliver, section, segment) with selective inflow vascular control. Also, it is not time consuming and it is very useful in re-resection, as well as oncologically reasonable.

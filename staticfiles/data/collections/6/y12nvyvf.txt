The surgical implantation of prostheses for soft tissue repair may be followed by post-operative mesh-related infection, a significant and dramatic complication, that is treated by mesh removal. A new antibiotic-eluting mesh has been manufactured on pre-existing polypropylene prostheses using an airbrush spraying technology. Among the degradable polymers tested as coating agents and drug reservoirs, poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL), which is deposited after heating, provides a homogeneous, regular and smooth shell around the polypropylene filaments of the mesh without dramatically altering the biomechanical properties of the new modified mesh. An anti-infective drug (e.g. ofloxacin) is incorporated into this polymeric coating giving a limited burst effect followed by sustained drug diffusion for several days. An ofloxacin-eluting mesh has demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity in vitro on Escherichia coli adherence, biofilm formation and inhibitory diameter, even with low drug loads. Although further in vivo investigations are required to draw conclusions on the anti-infective effectiveness of the coated mesh, the airbrush coating of ofloxacin-PCL on existing prostheses is already potentially appealing in an effort to decrease post-operative infection.

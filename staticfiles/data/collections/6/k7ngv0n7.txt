High-resolution retinal imaging is revolutionizing how scientists and clinicians study the retina on the cellular scale. Its exquisite sensitivity enables time-lapse optical biopsies that capture minute changes in the structure and physiological processes of cells in the living eye. This information is increasingly used to detect disease onset and monitor disease progression during early stages, raising the possibility of personalized eye care. Powerful high-resolution imaging tools have been in development for more than two decades; one that has garnered considerable interest in recent years is optical coherence tomography enhanced with adaptive optics. State-of-the-art adaptive optics optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT) makes it possible to visualize even highly transparent cells and measure some of their internal processes at all depths within the retina, permitting reconstruction of a 3D view of the living microscopic retina. In this review, we report current AO-OCT performance and its success in visualizing and quantifying these once-invisible cells in human eyes.

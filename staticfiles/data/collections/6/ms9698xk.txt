Virus entry into and release from epithelial cells are polarized as a result of the distribution of the viral receptors. In order to establish the polarity of entry and release of CCoV from epithelial cells, the interactions of the virus with A72 and CrFK cells grown on permeable supports was evaluated, and the amount of infective virus in the apical and in the basolateral media was determined and compared. Infection of A72 cells after different times post seeding demonstrated that CCoV grow after infection from both apical and basolateral sides. In CrFK cells, CCoV was observed in both compartments only in the later phase of the infection. To establish the reciprocal binding of CCoV on plasma membrane, A72 cells on a permeable support were preincubated with a mAb specific for CCoV. Infection from the apical side was blocked by mAb applied to that side; in contrast, such treatment on the basolateral side had no effect on the infectious process. Similarly, the low levels of CCoV observed after basolateral exposure to virus was abolished following mAb treatment of that side. The identification of CCoV into the basolateral medium could play an important role in the viral pathogenesis.

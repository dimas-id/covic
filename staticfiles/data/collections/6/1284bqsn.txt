OBJECTIVE To describe the radiographic and surgical findings of horses with osteochondral fragments (OCF) in the proximal intertarsal joint (PIJ) and to detail the technique for arthroscopic fragment retrieval and report outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Twenty-nine horses (32 tarsi) with OCF in the PIJ. METHODS Medical records of horses with radiographic evidence of OCF in the PIJ were reviewed. Clinical features, number of fragments, location, arthroscopic appearance, and outcome were recorded. Technical modifications with visual aids specific to this arthroscopic technique are described. RESULTS Twenty-seven horses (93%) had radiographic evidence of osteochondritis dissecans lesions in the tarsocrural joint (TCJ). OCF were most commonly located distal to the medial trochlear ridge of the talus. In all cases, fragments were successfully retrieved with a technique based on exposing the fragments after resection of the proximal intertarsal joint capsule (PIJC). Fragments were visible from the TCJ prior resection of the PIJC in 4 of 32 tarsi. A third portal was created to access fragments located distal to the lateral trochlear ridge in 3 of 32 tarsi. Moderate intra-articular bleeding occurred when the PIJC was resected in 3 of 32 tarsi. One horse had postoperative swelling that resolved with conservative medical management. All horses with long-term follow-up available (16/29) started training or returned to their athletic career. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The arthroscopic technique based on resection of PIJC was effective in retrieving OCF in the PIJ and was associated with minor complications. The clinical relevance of these fragments in the PIJ remains unknown.

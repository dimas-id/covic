BACKGROUND CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatality rate in Italy is controversial and is largely affecting discussion on the impact of containment measures that are straining the world's social and economic fabric, such as large-scale use of isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns. OBJECTIVE The scientific community, citizens, politicians and mass media are arguing over data that seem to suggest that Italy has a significantly higher number of COVID-19-related deaths than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have a misleading perception related to the number of actually performed swab tests. Citizens and mass media denounce that the coverage obtained by COVID-19 swab testing in Italy is not in line with other countries all over the world. METHODS In this paper, we try to clarify, with a set of statistical analysis conducted world-wide, both aspects by highlighting the actual numbers and by comparing them with the official data available. RESULTS The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rate are in line with the official world scenario, and these findings are true also for the number of COVID-19 swabs performed in Italy and in Lombardy Region. CONCLUSIONS Up-to-date analysis of this type may simplify the understanding of the pandemic evolution. CLINICALTRIAL

Abstract Interleukin-29 (IL-29) is a new member of the recently discovered interferon λ (IFNλ) family. It is produced predominantly by maturing dendritic cells and macrophages. It has been implicated in numerous immunological responses and has shown antiviral activity similar to the Type I interferons, although its target cell population is more limited than the Type I interferons. In recent years, the role of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of various cancers has also been extensively studied. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances of IL-29 in immunological processes and the pathogenesis of various cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of asymptomatic screening, including CA-125, imaging, and pelvic exam, in the diagnosis and management of recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: Women with ovarian cancer whose cancer recurred after remission were categorized by first method that their provider suspected disease recurrence: CA-125, imaging, symptoms, or physical exam. Differences in clinicopathologic, primary treatment characteristics, and outcomes data including secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) outcome and overall survival (OS) were collected. RESULTS: 102 patients were identified at our institution from 2003 to 2015. 20 recurrences were detected by symptoms, while 62 recurrences were diagnosed first by asymptomatic rise in CA-125, 5 by pelvic exam, and 15 by imaging in the absence of known exam abnormality or rise in CA-125. Mean time to recurrence was 18.9 months, and median survival was 45.8 months. These did not vary by recurrence detection method (all p > 0.4). Patients whose disease was detected by CA-125 were less likely to undergo SCS than those detected by other means (21.7% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.007). In addition to the 5 patients whose recurrence was detected primarily by pelvic exam, an additional 10 (total n = 15) patients had an abnormal pelvic exam at time of diagnosis of recurrence. DISCUSSION: Recurrence detection method was not associated with differing rates of survival or optimal SCS, however those patients detected by CA-125 were less likely to undergo SCS. The pelvic exam was a useful tool for detecting a significant proportion of recurrences.

Abstract Introduction MERS is caused by a viral infection, which was first identified in KSA, 2012. MERS-CoV infection consequences with either hospitalization or death. Methods All positive MERS-CoV cases that diagnosed in and reported to a referral hospital in Najran, KSA from March/2014 to December/2018 were revised retrospectively. We identified patients from infection control department and medical records. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. Results Of the 54 positive MERS-CoV cases, 3 cases were excluded because no available data. Therefore, the final number of the included cases in the study was 51 cases (94.4). Most of the patients were Saudi 36 (70.6%), and majority of cases were reported in the winter 18 (35.3) season. Fever 47 (92.2%), cough 44 (86.3%), and shortness of breath 37 (72.5%) were reported as most common symptoms. Most patients had DM and hypertension. Overall mortality rate was 37.3%, and interestingly the mortality rate dropped sharply over 5 years. In logistic regression analysis, Season and Chronic Kidney disease patients were the only two variables statistically significantly associated with death. The odds of death the patients infected by MERS-CoV during Autumn and Winter season were 4.09 times higher than those patients who infected during Spring and Summer season (OR = 4.09, CI 1.18-14.15, P < 0.026). Compared with MERS-CoV patients who had Non-Chronic kidney diseases, the odds of death the MERS-CoV patients who had chronic kidney diseases were 18.08 times higher (OR = 18.08, CI -2.01-162.99, P < 0.01). Conclusion The mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection was high. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the reasons behind the decrease in the mortality rate over the time period.

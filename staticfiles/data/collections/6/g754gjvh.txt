INTRODUCTION: Children’s Hospital Colorado is an academic, tertiary-care Level 1 Trauma Center with an emergency department (ED) that treats >70,000 patients/year. Patient volumes continue to increase, leading to worsening wait times and left-without-being-seen (LWBS) rates. In 2015, the ED’s median door-to-provider time was 49 minutes [interquartile range (IQR) = 26–90], with a 3.2% LWBS rate. ED leadership, staff, and providers aimed to improve patient flow with specific goals to (1) decrease door-to-provider times to a median of <30 minutes and (2) decrease annual LWBS rate to <1%. METHODS: An inter-professional team utilized quality improvement and Lean methodology to study, redesign, and implement significant changes to ED front-end processes. Key process elements included (1) new Flow Nurse/EMT roles, (2) elimination of traditional registration and triage processes, (3) immediate “quick registration” and nurse assessment upon walk-in, (4) direct-bedding of patients, and (5) a novel “Intake” system staffed by a pediatric emergency medicine physician. RESULTS: In the 12 months following full implementation of the new front-end system, the median door-to-provider time decreased 49% to 25 minutes (IQR = 13–50), and the LWBS rate decreased from 3.2% to 1.4% (a 56% relative decrease). Additionally, the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes of arrival increased, overall ED length-of-stay decreased, patient satisfaction improved, and no worsening of the unexpected 72-hour return rate occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Using quality improvement and Lean methodology, an inter-professional team decreased door-to-provider times and LWBS rates in a large pediatric ED by redesigning its front-end processes and implementing a novel pediatric emergency medicine-led Intake system.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a respiratory disorder caused by the highly contagious SARS‐CoV‐2. The immunopathological characteristics of COVID‐19 patients, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analyzed both the changes in the number of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID‐19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID‐19. IL‐6, IL‐10, and C‐reactive protein were remarkably up‐regulated in patients with severe COVID‐19. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, the elevation of IL‐6, IL‐10, and C‐reactive protein are reliable indicators of severe COVID‐19.

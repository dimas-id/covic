Effective mitigation of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) pandemic required true adoption of precautionary measures by the masses, that primarily depends upon their knowledge and practices behaviors. The current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge; practices of Pakistani residents regarding COVID-19 and factors associated with good knowledge and positive practices. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 15-April 2020 to 20 May 2020 among 689 Pakistanis by using a validated self-administered questionnaire. Regression analysis was applied to find potential predictor of knowledge and practices. Of 689 participants, more than half had good knowledge; 80% had good practices regarding COVID-19 and majority seek knowledge from social media. Knowledge was significantly higher (OR>1.00, p<0.05) among educated and higher income participants. Positive practices were significantly (OR>1.00, p<0.05) related to the older age ([â‰¥]50 years), higher education, higher income and good knowledge regarding COVID-19. The study concluded that Pakistani residents had good knowledge and practices towards COVID-19 yet there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge, and practice that should be focused in future awareness and educational campaigns. The study recommends the ministry of health authorities to promote all precautionary and preventive measures of COVID-19-consisting of a better-organized approach- to all strata of society: less privileged people, older ones and less educated people, in order to have equilibrium of knowledge about COVID-19; hence effective implementation of precautionary measures.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared 2020 as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. World Health Day on 7 April is dedicated to supporting nurses and midwives and highlights the central role of these professions in advancing universal health coverage, achieving health-related sustainable development goals, and the Eastern Mediterranean Region Vision 2023: Health for All by All. This year, we sadly mark World Health Day in the face of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought to attention more than ever the crucial and invaluable role of health workers, who are working tirelessly day and night to care for patients and save lives. In fighting COVID-19, not only might they become infected and put their own lives at risk, but they also face distress and burnout because of long working hours. In addition, many health workers have to be away from their homes for prolonged periods, for fear of putting their own families at risk of acquiring the infection. Even before the pandemic, the safety and security of health workers in the Eastern Mediterranean Region has been a significant concern, as more than half of the countries of the Region face acute and protracted crises, and 70- 80% of total recorded attacks on health facilities globally occur in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.

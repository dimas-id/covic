Along with the recent development of intraluminal interventional techniques and correlated imaging methods, one-stop hybrid operation has become a new focus in clinical settings. The aim of this study is to discuss the clinical significance of the one-stop hybrid endarterectomy surgery in the treatment of complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. In this study, clinical data from 10 patients with complex ischemic cerebrovascular diseases (including multi-vessel severe stenosis of the internal extracranial carotid artery, single vessel series stenosis of the internal extracranial carotid artery, in-stent restenosis, complete occlusion of the common carotid or the internal carotid artery) admitted to Beijing Xuanwu Hospital and Liaocheng Brain Hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. All enrolled subjects underwent three types of hybrid operations. The clinical efficacy of this surgery was subsequently assessed in this clinical trial. The results indicated that no related surgical complications were noted during the perioperative period. Intraoperative and postoperative imaging revealed no signs of vascular stenosis, the blood supply recovered, and clinical symptoms were alleviated. The follow-up lasted for 6 to 12 months. Imaging re-examination showed no evidence of re-stenosis and good blood circulation was present in the recanalized blood vessels. Favorable treatment efficacy was achieved. The intracranial blood supply was significantly improved postoperatively. In conclusion, one-stop hybrid operation plays an important role in treating complex stenosis cerebrovascular diseases.

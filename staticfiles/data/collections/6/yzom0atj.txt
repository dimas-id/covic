Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are a fast developing branch of the pharmaceutical industry, in both Poland and rest of the world. The aim of the work was to evaluate the factors that influence the purchase and use of OTC medications in prevention and treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. The analysis involved 450 randomly chosen subjects, aged 19-80. The study was performed using a questionnaire which included a number of questions related to the characteristics of respondents such as: health, socio-demographic data, and factors influencing the purchase of OTC medications used in respiratory tract infections. The self-medication phenomenon in upper respiratory tract infections is significant in Poland and will continue to increase with support of many demographic and socio-economic factors. Despite certain health risks resulting from the inappropriate use of OTC medications, it should continue to be offered as a part of the pharmaceutical market.

In an initial investigation possible nanotechnology application contexts were considered and qualitatively evaluated. Also studies to life cycle aspects of nanotechnology were analyzed. So far, only a handful of life cycle assessments (LCAs) on nanotechnologies have been completed. A summary of studies of life cycle aspects identified are provided.

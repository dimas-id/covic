Thrombocytopenia (defined by platelet count <150 x 109 /L) has been observed in up to 36% of patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; Guan et al, 2020). In this setting, thrombocytopenia is usually mild, caused by platelet activation and consumption (Thachil, 2020; Pavord et al, 2020). In a recent paper published in the British Journal of Haematology, Jiang et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 31 studies involving 7613 participants and found a significant association between thrombocytopenia and severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients or poor outcome in this setting (Jiang et al, 2020). However, other clinical, biological and radiological factors strongly impact COVID-19 outcome. Whether thrombocytopenia is independently associated to poor outcome in this population is unknown. This study was aimed at addressing this question.

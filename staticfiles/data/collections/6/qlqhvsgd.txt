The objective of this study was to show laparoscopic subtotal, distal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy as a safe and appropriate method for the resection of advanced gastric cancer. This study was conducted at a designated NCI Cancer Center. Subjects of the study were patients with advanced gastric malignancy, including transmural penetration of the tumor and/or nodal disease, requiring subtotal, distal gastrectomy. The main outcome measure is a description of the technique of a laparoscopic subtotal, distal gastrectomy for antral and distal body tumors. In conclusion, the laparoscopic approach to advanced gastric malignancy with a subtotal, distal gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy is a safe, oncologically appropriate procedure which provides excellent outcomes.

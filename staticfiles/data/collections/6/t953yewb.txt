BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is the most efficient therapy for morbid obesity. Staple line and anastomotic leakage are the most feared postoperative complications after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Traditional treatment options like revisional surgery and endoscopic stent placement are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as variable success rates. Endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) has shown to be a new successful and feasible treatment option for leaks of different etiology after major gastro-esophageal surgery. METHOD We report a case of the EVT principle being applied in a patient with three major leaks located apart from each other within the gastric staple line after LSG for morbid obesity (BMI 62.7). EVT was initiated on postoperative day 8. RESULTS In total, 18 endoscopic interventions were performed in 72 days, the vacuum sponge being replaced endoscopically every 4 days. Hospital length of stay was 106 days. No relevant procedure related complications were observed during the course of therapy and during the follow up. CONCLUSION EVT of postoperative leaks in the upper GI tract has been shown to be feasible and safe. It combines defect closure and effective drainage and allows a periodic inspection of the wound cavity. In case of therapeutic failure, it does not jeopardize surgical repair or stent placement. Even though the techniques and materials used in EVT still vary considerably according to local expertise, EVT has the potential to succeed as a nonsurgical, feasible, safe, and effective treatment option for postoperative leaks in bariatric surgery.

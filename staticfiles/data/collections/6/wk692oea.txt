In recent years, emergency preparedness has continued to be a major focus for many health care providers. This study measured public health workers' opinions on disaster preparedness, assessed workers' likelihood of reporting to various types of disasters, and evaluated conditions that will encourage workers to report to work. A focus group and literature search were conducted to inform a survey that would assess attitudes about disasters. Frequencies were calculated on survey responses. Most respondents believed other employees could perform their jobs during a disaster; however, fewer than two thirds thought their coworkers would report to work under such circumstances. Fewer than three fourths of respondents would report to work during an emergency involving a known chemical, an unknown biological, a radiological, a biological incurable, or an unknown chemical agent. These results indicate training gaps that should be addressed in future training sessions at the two health departments surveyed.

In recent years, it has become increasingly popular to use matrices, such as acellular dermal matrices, in implant-based breast reconstruction. To lower the cost and to avoid implanting biological material, the use of synthetic meshes has been proposed. This is the first study examining TIGR® Mesh in a larger series of immediate breast reconstruction. The aims of the study were to examine complications and predictors for complications. All consecutive patients operated on with breast reconstruction with TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh and tissue expanders (TEs) or permanent implant between March 2015 and September 2016 in our department were prospectively included. Exclusion criteria were ongoing smoking, BMI (kg/m2) > 30, planned postoperative radiation, and inability to leave informed consent. Fifteen breasts (23%) were affected by complications within 30 d: four (6.2%) major complications and eleven (17%) minor complications. The major complications included two implant losses and one pulmonary embolism (PE). Predictors for a complication were age over 51 years, BMI over 24.5 kg/m2, large resection weight, and the need for a wise pattern excision of skin. Four minor surgical complications occurred after 30 d (minimum follow-up 17 months). There were no implant losses. In addition, minor aesthetic corrections, such as dog-ear resection, were performed in 10 breasts. In conclusion, breast reconstruction with a TE in combination with TIGR® Matrix Surgical Mesh can be performed with a low complication rate.

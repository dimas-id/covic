Recurrent wheezing is common in preschool-aged children, with 1 in 3 children experiencing at least 1 acute wheezing illness before the age of 3 years. These children represent a diverse group, with some going on to present with asthma at school age and others experiencing complete resolution of symptoms. The primary care physician is faced with a dilemma of when to recommend daily therapy. He or she must also answer parents' concerns, often expressed as, "Does my child have asthma?" and "Will my child have to take medication the rest of his or her life?" This article presents recent studies and recommendations that can guide the physician in approaching the child and the parent with rational management. The emphasis is on viewing recurrent wheezing as a continuum requiring a plan of monitoring that starts with the very first episode. Using background information from the parents and a history of the child's allergic disposition, one can discuss with parents the risks of developing asthma and, together with planned monitoring, prescribe appropriate management. The primary care physician can plan management by using the Asthma Predictive Index and employing specific questions for features present during the intervals between acute episodes. Together with close monitoring, the physician will have a compass that effectively directs rational management.

The COVID-19 was first described in late 2019 that quickly became a pandemic affecting every health system as we know it. The high transmissibility among humans represents a well-known high burden of morbidity and mortality not only for cardiovascular patients but also for a higher risk between health care professionals that must deliver high-quality care to them in any scenario, and cardiac catheterization rooms are no exception. This creates a new dilemma, minimize exposure to patients and health care professionals to COVID-19 while maintaining high quality in cardiovascular therapeutics. In order to achieve this, several international recommendations on treatment algorithms modifications and in safety measures in the catheterization room have been published, always aiming to solve this dilemma in the best possible way. Hereby, we present a summary of the most recent treatment algorithms in the most important cardiovascular interventions (acute coronary syndromes, structural and congenital heart diseases) as well as specific safety measures with a step-by-step preparedness before and after any interventional procedure during COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this document is to inform and to train health care professionals that works in cardiac catheterization rooms on the risks as well on the plan for containment, mitigation, and response to the global situation of COVID-19 infection in order to apply this in their own local work environments.

Lipopeptide lipid moieties induce dendritic cell (DC) internalization and epitopes are recognized by MHC, the major histocompatibility complex. HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) lipopeptide vaccine candidate elicits immune responses, and sustains HIV control after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Mp- and Dp-MART (anti-melanoma lipopeptides) induce strong CTL (cytolytic T lymphocyte) response. New BGTC, BGDA, TGKC lipoplexes mediate gene delivery, e.g., into mouse pancreatic tumor nodules. Triterpene glycyrrhizic acid (GL) inhibits SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus) replication. Compared to CDV (cidofovir), CDV ether lipid esters have enhanced activity against vaccinia (VV) and cowpox (CV) viruses in vitro. Oral treatment of VV and CV infected mice with CDV ether lipid esters, as effective as i.p. CDV, may be useful against orthopoxvirus infections in humans.

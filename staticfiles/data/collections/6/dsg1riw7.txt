BACKGROUND Mitral repair is recommended for patients with significant organic mitral regurgitation (MR). The nonresectional dynamic mitral valve repair (NVR) method involves a complete flexible ring and artificial chordal insertion but without leaflet resection or annular plication. The aim of this study was to compare changes in mitral annular structure and function after the NVR technique with those after a resectional mitral valve repair (RVR) method, which involves leaflet resection and annuloplasty with a partial flexible ring. METHODS Patients with organic severe MR undergoing mitral valve repair with either technique underwent three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography before and after surgery. The mitral annulus was tracked offline and measured throughout the cardiac cycle. Mitral leaflet mobility was also measured. RESULTS Fifteen patients underwent repair with NVR, and 13 underwent repair with RVR (age, 56 vs 61 years, respectively). Both operations reduced mitral annular area significantly (maximum area reduction, from 18.5 ± 4.6 to 6.6 ± 1.7 cm(2) and from 20.1 ± 4.8 to 6 ± 1.5 cm(2) with the NVR and RVR techniques, respectively; P < .001). In contrast to RVR, patients who underwent NVR maintained dynamic changes in mitral annular area, circumference, and anterior-posterior diameter during the cardiac cycle. Mitral leaflet mobility was reduced with both techniques, but posterior leaflet mobility was restricted with RVR. CONCLUSIONS The size of the mitral annulus is reduced after repair with either surgical approach. Compared with resectional valve repair, more dynamic changes in the structure of the mitral annulus are maintained during the cardiac cycle with the NVR technique early postoperatively, along with more preserved motion of the posterior leaflet.

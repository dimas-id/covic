Evolutionary conservation derived from a multiple sequence alignment is a powerful indicator of the functional significance of a residue, and it can help to predict active sites, ligand-binding sites, and protein interaction interfaces. The results of the existing algorithms in identifying the residueâ€™s conservation strongly depend on the sequence alignment, making the results highly variable. Here, by introducing the amino acid similarity matrix, we propose a novel gap-treating approach by combining the evolutionary information and von Neumann entropies to compute the residue conservation scores. It is indicated through a series of tested results that the new approach is quite encouraging and promising and may become a useful tool in complementing the existing methods.

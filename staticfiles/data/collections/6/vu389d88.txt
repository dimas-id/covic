COVID‐19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus and is currently a global pandemic. HLA variation is associated with COVID‐19 because HLA plays a pivotal role in the immune response to pathogens. Here, 82 individuals with COVID‐19 were genotyped for HLA‐A, ‐B, ‐C, ‐DRB1, ‐DRB3/4/5, ‐DQA1, ‐DQB1, ‐DPA1, and ‐DPB1 loci using next‐generation sequencing (NGS). Frequencies of the HLA‐C*07:29, C*08:01G, B*15:27, B*40:06, DRB1*04:06, and DPB1*36:01 alleles were higher, while the frequencies of the DRB1*12:02 and DPB1*04:01 alleles were lower in COVID‐19 patients than in the control population, with uncorrected statistical significance. Only HLA‐C*07:29 and B*15:27 were significant when the corrected P‐value was considered. These data suggested that some HLA alleles may be associated with the occurrence of COVID‐19.

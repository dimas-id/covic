In this paper, we describe the results of analyzing a large-scale survey, called the Covid19Impact survey, to assess citizens feedback on four areas related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: social contact behavior, financial impact, working situation and health status. A total of 24 questions cover the areas of demographics, their home situation, social contact behavior, personal economic impact, their workplace situation and their health. The survey was responded to by 156,614 participants between the evening of March 28th and April 2nd, 2020. Such a large response enables us to gain new insights, as well as an unprecedented glimpse at respondents personal experiences and concerns during the current COVID-19 pandemic. From the analysis, we draw several implications for the design of public policies related to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created an unprecedented need for mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients. To meet this increased demand, some facilities were forced to use anesthesia gas machines (AGMs) as intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators. While an off-label use, AGM manufacturers, the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists have guidelines for AGM use in the ICU, however, there is scant literature describing their use. This article describes our experiences at New York University Langone Medical Center using AGMs in the ICU for ventilating critically ill COVID-19 patients.

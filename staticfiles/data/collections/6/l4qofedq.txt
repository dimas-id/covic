Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel FAST (RVP FAST) assay detects 17 human respiratory virus strains per measurement. Studying RVP FAST efficacy in detecting respiratory viruses in 67 aspirate samples from the nasal cavities of children with acute respiratory infection, we compared RVP FAST results to those of conventional nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT), e.g., real-time PCR, targeting 8 strains. RVP FAST assay detected 13 strains (98 isolates) in 59 of 67 samples. Of these, 8--influenza virus (Inf.V)-AH1, Inf. V-AH3, novel Inf.V-AH1, and Inf.V-B, and adenovirus, RS virus, metapneumovirus, and bocavirus--were compared to NAT results. RVP FAST showed higher sensitivity (83.3-100%) and specificity (98.2-100%) than NAT. RVP FAST also detected coronavirus (CoV) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 from 10 virus strain samples and enterovirus and/or rhinovirus from 35. RVP FAST assay thus comprehensively detects clinically important viruses in a single measurement, making RVP FAST assay useful in detecting causative respiratory tract viruses.

Two diseases that for many years have been suspected to be of viral origin are multiple sclerosis (MS) and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). With the use of a new technique called representational difference analysis both these diseases have recently been associated with new lymphotropic herpesviruses, i.e. human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 8. HHV-6 is a ubiquitous virus and the etiological agent of exanthema subitum. Viral neuroinvasion occurs frequently in primary HHV-6 infection, and meningitis, encephalitis and demyelination have been described as rare complications. A relation with MS has been suggested for HHV-6, as the virus has been detected in MS plaques in the brain. Data from different studies are, however, conflicting and a definitive role for HHV-6 in MS pathogenesis has not been established. HHV-8 is believed to be the causative agent of KS, and is also associated with some rare hematological malignancies. The viral genome contains several potential oncogenes that are believed to have been picked up from the human genome during evolution. The role of HHV-8 in healthy, immunocompetent individuals is however uncertain. In conclusion, the full spectrum of human diseases associated with these new viruses is not yet understood, and rapid developments in molecular biology will continue to shed new light on the interactions between herpesviruses and their hosts.

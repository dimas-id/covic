PURPOSE Self-expandable stents have broadened the spectrum of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. However, procedures involving double stenting in Y/X configurations carry a relatively high risk of procedural complications. The Neuroform ATLAS, the evolution of Neuroform EZ, is a nitinol self-expanding hybrid/open cell stent which can be delivered through a low profile 0.017 inch catheter. We present our experience in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with this stent in Y and X configurations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively maintained a database from consecutive patients who underwent double stent assisted coiling with the Neuroform ATLAS, from July 2015 to February 2019. Clinical and angiographic results were analyzed. RESULTS 55 patients harboring 55 bifurcation aneurysms were treated with double stenting: 52 'Y' configurations, 3 'X' configurations. Deployment was successful in all cases. Post-treatment control angiography showed complete occlusion in 33 cases (60%), neck remnant in 8 cases (14.5%), and incomplete occlusion in 14 cases (25.4%). The overall symptomatic periprocedural complication rate was 12.7%. 38 aneurysms underwent follow-up (69%, mean duration 16 months): 33 aneurysms (87%) were completely occluded, 3 aneurysms (8%) had a neck remnant, and 2 aneurysms (5%) were incompletely occluded. CONCLUSION The Neuroform ATLAS is an effective device for treatment of bifurcation aneurysms, allowing good conformability, a high level of navigability, and easy mesh crossing to perform Y/X stenting procedures. The rate of procedural complications remains non-negligible, and an indication for a double stenting procedure should be carefully discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting.

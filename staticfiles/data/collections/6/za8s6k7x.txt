Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a novel infectious disease that continues to spread on a global scale. There has been growing concern about donor‐derived transmissions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). Herein, we present the case of a patient who underwent ABO‐incompatible living donor liver transplantation without knowing that the liver donor was infected with COVID‐19 during the donation procedure. In this case, the donor‐derived transmission to the recipient was not identified, and the liver donor was found to be recovering from a COVID‐19 infection. The donor‐derived transmission was not identified.

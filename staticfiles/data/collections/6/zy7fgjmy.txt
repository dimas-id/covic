This chapter gives an overview of the paradoxical dynamic that shapes the World; with on the one hand an ever-wider inequality gap; over-exploitation of natural resources and climate change; and on the other hand, a growing understanding of the possibilities and promise of the future connection, collaboration, and complementarity between people and countriesâ€”both propelled by the combination of science, wealth, and technology. This chapter points out some of the reasons for the insufficient progress made by traditional approaches to development and humanitarian aid. It offers arguments why nonprofit institutions whose justification is to help, must begin by helping their staff to help themselves. Organizations with an inspiring social mission must practice internally what they preach externally. Whether these organizations live up to the inspirational potential that goes with their mandate, is conditioned by their ability to place the aspiration for meaning at the center of their action, internally and externally.

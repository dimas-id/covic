SARS is an infectious disease caused by a previously unrecognized human coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Current information indicates that most transmission is via respiratory droplets coming from a person who is symptomatic with SARS ("close contact"). The aim of our study is to evidence the critical role of the family physician, the first health-care worker who cares with suspected/probable SARS patients, underlying the importance of the correct use and management of the personal protective equipment.

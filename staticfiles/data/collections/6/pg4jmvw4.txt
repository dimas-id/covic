Infectious agents have been postulated as causes of multiple sclerosis for over a century. The possible role of a virus or viruses is supported by data that (1) a childhood exposure is involved and “viral” infections may precipitate exacerbations of disease, (2) experimental infections in animals and natural infections in humans can cause diseases with long incubation periods, remitting and relapsing courses, and demyelination, and (3) patients with multiple sclerosis have abnormal immune responses to viruses. The pathogenesis of three human demyelinating diseases of known viral etiology is discussed. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a papovavirus selectively infects oligodendrocytes and causes focal areas of demyelination. In postmeasles encephalomyelitis, the virus is lymphotrophic and disrupts immune regulation that can result in an autoimmune perivenular demyelinating illness without evidence of infection of the central nervous system. In human immunodeficiency virus‐encephalopathy and myelopathy virus is present in macrophages and microglia and the myelin abnormalities apparently are caused by soluble factors such as viral proteins, cytokines, or neurotoxins. These findings may have implications on how, when, and where to seek viruses in multiple sclerosis.

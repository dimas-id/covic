Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are defined as lymphocytes that lack RAG recombinase and do not express diverse antigen receptors; however, recent studies have revealed the adaptive features of ILCs. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)- and cytokine-induced memory natural killer (NK) cells circulate in the blood and are referred to as conventional memory NK cells. In contrast, virus- and hapten-induced memory NK cells, hapten-induced memory ILC1s, and cytokine-induced memory-like ILC2s exhibit long-term residency in the liver or lung, and are referred to as tissue-resident memory ILCs. Considering their similar migration patterns and memory potential, tissue-resident memory ILCs could be regarded as innate counterparts of resident memory T (T(RM)) cells. Both tissue-resident memory ILCs and T(RM) cells share common characteristics in terms of dynamics, phenotype, and molecular regulation. The emergence of ILC memory expands the basic biology of ILCs and prompts us to re-examine their functions in disease progression. This review discusses the evidence supporting tissue-resident memory NK cells and other memory ILC subsets, compares them with T(RM) cells, and highlights key unsolved questions in this emerging field.

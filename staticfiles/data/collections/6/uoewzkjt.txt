OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic on practice patterns, clinical behavior, personal health, and emotional/psychological concerns of rhinologists. METHODS: A 15-question survey was sent out to the American Rhinologic Society's (ARS) membership to determine the impact of COVID-19 during the crisis. Demographic factors and practice patterns were collected and evaluated. RESULTS: There were 224 total respondents out of 835 ARS members queried (26.8% response rate). Study queries were sent in April 2020. Notably, 17.8% reported illness in themselves or their staff and 74.4% noted a psychological/emotional impact. A plurality of rhinologists noted their practice volume and in-office procedure volume has become 20.0% and 0.0% of their prior volumes, respectively. In addition, 96.2% were noted to be using telemedicine in our subspecialty. CONCLUSION: In addition to severely impacting volume and the perception of future decreases in patients and revenue, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a physical and emotional impact on rhinologists in ways that need to be further studied. These data include significantly novel and objective information. The COVID-19 crisis also reveals the important role of telemedicine in rhinology. Guidelines regarding personal protective equipment for in-office visits, nasal endoscopy, and other in-office and operating room procedures would be particularly helpful as future waves are expected.

It is known that silver has microbicidal qualities; even at a low concentration, silver is active against many kinds of bacteria. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been extensively studied for a wide range of applications. Alternately, the toxicity of silver to human cells is considerably lower than that to bacteria. Recent studies have shown that AgNPs also have antiviral activity. We found that large amounts of hydroxyl radicals—highly reactive molecular species—are generated when AgNPs are irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation with a wavelength of 365 nm, classified as ultraviolet A (UVA). In this study, we used electron spin resonance direct detection to confirm that UV irradiation of AgNPs produced rapid generation of hydroxyl radicals. As hydroxyl radicals are known to degrade bacteria, viruses, and some chemicals, the enhancement of the microbicidal activity of AgNPs by UV radiation could be valuable for the protection of healthcare workers and the prevention of the spread of infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVE Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious atypical pneumonia caused by a novel pathogen. We describe our experience using a mobile CT scanner in an improvised isolation ward with life-support systems, portable lead shielding, and strict barrier nursing. This scanner was used exclusively for patients with SARS and patients with other illnesses who were also thought to have SARS. This arrangement freed the other CT scanners in the main department for non-SARS patients. In 5 weeks, 90 studies were performed; no cases of cross infection of health care workers were reported. CONCLUSION Mobile CT may be used to provide dedicated radiology services to seriously ill patients requiring strict isolation during an infectious disease outbreak.

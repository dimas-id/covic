There is a well-known and established link between high lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in blood and the metabolic syndrome (MS). MS is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we define an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and LPS and its link to aggravated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoresis under native conditions demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to Escherichia coli LPS, forming high molecular weight aggregates. Microscale thermophoresis analysis further defined the interaction, having a KD of ~47 nM, similar to the observed affinity between LPS and the human receptor CD14. Moreover, S protein, when combined with low levels of LPS, boosted nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and cytokine responses in monocytic THP-1 cells and human blood, respectively. In an experimental model of localized inflammation, employing NF-κB reporter mice and in vivo bioimaging, S protein in conjunction with LPS significantly increased the inflammatory response when compared with S protein and LPS alone. Apart from providing information on LPS as a ligand for S protein, our results are of relevance for studies on comorbidities involving bacterial endotoxins, such as the MS, or co-existing acute and chronic infections in COVID-19 patients.

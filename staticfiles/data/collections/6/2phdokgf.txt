OBJECTIVE To report a case of a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who acutely developed a hypokinetic-rigid syndrome. METHODS Patient data were obtained from medical records from the "Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre" in Madrid, Spain. [123I]-ioflupane dopamine transporter single-photon emission CT (DaT-SPECT) images were acquired 4 hours after a single dose of 185 MBq of 123I-FP-CIT. Quantitative analysis was performed using DaTQUANTTM software providing the specific binding ratio (SBR) and z-score values of the striatum. RESULTS We report a previously healthy 58-year-old man who developed hyposmia, generalized myoclonus, fluctuating and transient changes in level of consciousness, opsoclonus and an asymmetric hypokinetic-rigid syndrome with ocular abnormalities after a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. DaT-SPECT confirmed a bilateral decrease in presynaptic dopamine uptake asymmetrically involving both putamina. Significant improvement in the parkinsonian symptoms was observed without any specific treatment. CONCLUSION This case study provides clinical and functional neuroimaging evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central nervous system, affecting midbrain structures and leading to neurological signs and symptoms.

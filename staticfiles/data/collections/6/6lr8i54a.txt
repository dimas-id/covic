Background: Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 is a challenge for nowadays medical practice. Although there is no clarity in the principal mechanism of lung damage and ARDS development, it has been suggested that one of the main reasons of this pathology is the hyperactivation of the immune system, better known as cytokine storm syndrome. Tocilizumab has been proposed to treat COVID-19 severe cases associated to ARDS. Results & methodology: Here we present two successful cases of tocilizumab administration in two COVID-19 patients with prior administration of antiviral therapy (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir and ritonavir) with adequate response and resolution of ARDS, septic shock and severe pneumonia within the first 72 h. Discussion & conclusion: This case supports the usage of tocilizumab as an effective therapy in COVID-19 associated cytokine storm syndrome. Further studies should be done in order to assess its effectiveness and security.

INTRODUCTION Several options are available for preserving fertility before cytotoxic treatment, including ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Most reported surgical techniques include electrocoagulation. Our hypothesis is that avoidance of electrocoagulation may decrease ovarian cortex injury during cryopreservation procedures. CASE PRESENTATION We report a laparoscopic technique of whole-ovary removal without coagulation using Endo-GIA forceps and clips. Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed for cryopreservation in a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with breast cancer and for whom chemotherapy was planned. The procedure was completed quickly and without complication. This Endo-GIA procedure was of short duration with a short period of ischemia before freezing. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ovariectomy using the Endo-GIA stapling device procedure without coagulation may diminish ovary injury before ovarian cryopreservation.

Incorporation of tablet computers (TCs) into patient assessment may facilitate safe and secure data collection. We evaluated the usefulness and acceptability of a TC as an electronic self-report symptom assessment instrument. Research Electronic Data Capture Web-based application supported data capture. Information was collected and disseminated in real time and a structured format. Completed questionnaires were printed and given to the physician before the patient visit. Most participants completed the survey without assistance. Completion rate was 100%. The median global quality of life was high for all. More than half reported pain. Based on Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the top 3 most common symptoms were tiredness, anxiety, and decreased well-being. Patient and physician acceptability for these quick and useful TC-based surveys was excellent.

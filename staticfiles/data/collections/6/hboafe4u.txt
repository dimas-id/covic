These speed bumps are some of the reasons why many industry watchers and public health officials are praising the development of a 5 min bedside, or point-of-care, test produced by Abbott Laboratories Approved in late March, the test relies on PCR but uses a different method of copying genetic material, allowing it to be done at a constant temperature and quickly Other companies that use this method, called isothermal amplification, for infectious disease diagnostics have developed specialized enzymes that can copy viral RNA without the temperature cycling used in more traditional PCR Itâ€™s not clear exactly how Abbott is employing isothermal amplification, but the company says the test can be done in a small, portable machine that many hospitals already use to diagnose other infectious diseases Abbott says this test and another, more traditional PCR diagnostic it developed can perform up to 5 million COVID-19 tests per month total

Gastrointestinal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Infectious organisms are often recovered by microbiological methods, but surgical pathologists may play a very valuable role in diagnosis. This review will focus on infective disorders of the gastrointestinal tract with an emphasis on enterocolitides caused by food‐ and water‐borne pathogens. Diagnostic histological features of selected enteric infections will be emphasized, including those that mimic other inflammatory conditions of the gut (such as ischaemia or idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease), along with available diagnostic methods that can aid in diagnosis.

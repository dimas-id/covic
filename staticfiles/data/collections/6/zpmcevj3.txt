The 5′ leader is documented to be an important regulatory element in many (+) ssRNA virus genome. To understand the significance of the 5′ leader RNA of PRRSV, we determined the complete leader sequences of fifteen different North American strains of PRRSV and predicted their secondary structures. Viruses analysed included three reference strains and nine field strains originating from different geographic locations. To further examine the leader region, one of the field strains was adapted to grow in tissue culture, and three clones were isolated. We also predicted the secondary structures of two European strains based on their published sequences. The predicted RNA secondary structures of the leader sequences suggested the existence of three conserved domains formed by the 5′ region of the leader among the North American strains, two of which were conserved in the European strains. A variable structural domain was predicted from the 3′ region of the leader sequences of the North American strains, where all tissue culture-adapted isolates were characterized by a stem-loop while field isolates were characterized by an internal bulge within the stem-loop.

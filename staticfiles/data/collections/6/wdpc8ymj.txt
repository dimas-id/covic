BACKGROUND: The changes in the volatile profile of a pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata, Duch.) purée processed by high pressure thermal processing (HPT) at different pressure and initial temperature intensities (300, 600, 900 MPa and 60, 80 °C respectively) was evaluated. Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique was used for the extraction and concentration of volatile compounds and the analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: Alcohols were the volatile compounds most abundantly isolated in the headspace of pumpkin purée (control and processed purées had ranges between 43-56%), followed by aldehydes (14-28%), hydrocarbons (8-13%) and terpenes (7-10%). Lipid oxidation, Maillard reaction and carotenoids degradation were the main chemical routes of formation of volatile compounds after HPT processing. Initial temperature or pressure intensity of HPT processing, within the ranges tested in this study, did not affect the initial levels of volatile compounds of pumpkin purée. CONCLUSION: HPT processing is an effective technology for the preservation of the original aroma of low acid vegetables such as pumpkin. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

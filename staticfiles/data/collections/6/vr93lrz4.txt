BACKGROUND Erectile dysfunction (ED) and premature ejaculation (PE) are the two most prevalent sexual disorders among males associated with significant distress and impairment in quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among patients with primary ED and PE. METHODS A sample of 57 men (ED = 31; PE = 26) were compared to 25 male outpatients with anxiety disorder (AD) and 25 healthy controls. Principal assessment measures included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS Greater levels of STAI state anxiety were reported among the ED, PE, and AD groups as compared to healthy controls. In contrast ED and AD groups scored higher than controls on the STAI trait anxiety and BDI, but PE scores were not different from healthy controls in both measures. CONCLUSIONS The study findings suggest that both primary ED and PE are conditions associated with significant state anxiety; however, PE appears to be less associated with trait anxiety and depression compared to ED, a finding that corroborates the recent acknowledgement of PE as a more biologically based condition. Limitations and potential clinical implications are also discussed.

In this paper, we establish a discrete-time analog for coupled within-host and between-host systems for an environmentally driven infectious disease with fast and slow two time scales by using the non-standard finite difference scheme. The system is divided into a fast time system and a slow time system by using the idea of limit equations. For the fast system, the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the basic reproduction number and the existence for infection-free and unique virus infectious equilibria are obtained, and the threshold conditions on the local stability of equilibria are established. In the slow system, except for the positivity and boundedness of the solutions, the existence for disease-free, unique endemic and two endemic equilibria are obtained, and the sufficient conditions on the local stability for disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are established. To return to the coupling system, the local stability for the virus- and disease-free equilibrium, and virus infectious but disease-free equilibrium is established. The numerical examples show that an endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and the other one is unstable when there are two endemic equilibria.

Four species of human bocavirus (HBoV) have been recently discovered and classified in the Bocavirus genus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae). Although detected both in respiratory and stool samples worldwide, HBoV1 is predominantly a respiratory pathogen, whereas HBoV2, HBoV3, and HBoV4 have been found mainly in stool. A variety of signs and symptoms have been described in patients with HBoV infection including rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, pneumonia, acute otitis media, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Many of these potential manifestations have not been systematically explored, and they have been questioned because of high HBoV co-infection rates in symptomatic subjects and high HBoV detection rates in asymptomatic subjects. However, evidence is mounting to show that HBoV1 is an important cause of lower respiratory tract illness. The best currently available diagnostic approaches are quantitative PCR and serology. This concise review summarizes the current clinical knowledge on HBoV species.

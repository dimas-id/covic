Innate immunity is a crucial defense system against viral and bacterial pathogens, providing a rapid response to mitigate the effects of microbial attack. While more readily associated with respiration and metabolism, recent research has surprisingly identified a number of mitochondrial factors in the mammalian innate immune system. This review summarizes the novel mitochondrial proteins, such as MAVS and NLRX1, involved in this process and attempts to reconcile this new mitochondrial function with our previous knowledge of the organelle.

Accurate and rapid diagnosis is needed for timely intervention and clinical management of acute respiratory infections. This study evaluated performance characteristics of the Panther Fusion assay for the detection of influenza A virus (Flu A), influenza B virus (Flu B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3 (Para 1 to 3), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus (RV), and adenovirus (Adeno) targets in comparison to those of the eSensor and Lyra assays using 395 nasopharyngeal (NP) and 104 lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens. Based on the consensus positive result established (positive result in 2 of the 3 assays), the NP specimens for the Fusion and eSensor assays had 100% positive percent agreement (PPA) for all the analytes and the Lyra assays had 100% PPA for Flu A and Adeno analytes. A 100% negative percent agreement (NPA) was observed for all the Lyra analytes, whereas those for the Fusion targets ranged from 98.4 to 100% and those for the eSensor ranged from 99.4 to 100% for all the analytes except RV. For the LRT specimens, Fusion had 100% PPA and 100% NPA for all the targets except hMPV. There was a 100% PPA for eSensor analytes; the NPA ranged from 98 to 100%, except for RV. For the Lyra assays, the PPA ranged between 50 and 100%, while the NPA was 100% for all the targets except Adeno. The Fusion assay performed similarly to the eSensor assay for majority of the targets tested and provides laboratories with a fully automated random-access system to test for a broad array of viral respiratory pathogens.

New virus SARS‐Cov‐2 infection has spread over the world affecting all daily activities, including functioning of health services. Due to pandemic many hospitals were ordered to re‐organize their work. The aim of the current report was to evaluate the influence of COVID‐19 pandemic on the hospitalizations at the tertiary dermatology department in south‐west Poland. Two corresponding periods of 2019 and 2020 were compared in aspect of number of hospitalizations, sex and age profile of inpatients. We clearly showed a significant reduction of hospitalized patients during the pandemic period, with marked reduction of female patients. Moreover, the significant decrease of admissions to dermatology ward was observed within children and patients older than 70 years. Patients with chronic inflammatory dermatoses (eg, atopic dermatitis, eczemas, lichen planus, pityriasis rubra pilaris) were less often hospitalized during the pandemic period. In contrast, patients suffering from dermatitis due to substances taken internally, erysipelas, syphilis and primary cutaneous lymphomas constituted significantly higher rate of hospitalized subjects in 2020 year.

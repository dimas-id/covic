IMPORTANCE: Although Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected by COVID-19, for the first 2.5 months since its first reported case on January 23, 2020, it remained one of the few nations with successful containment of spread of the pandemic with little mortality and zero intra-hospital transmissions, without instituting a major lockdown of the country. In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeon’s role becomes rather vague. However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do. By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe. OBSERVATIONS: Contingencies should be in place for prioritization of existing patients, triaging and treatment of suspected patients, infection control, manpower management and novel strategies for inter-disciplinary communications and education in a hospital’s surgical unit during a pandemic. Working in a high risk environment with manpower and resource limitations for prolonged periods of time has effect on morale and affects surgeon burn-out. Transparent communication, avenues to address psychological needs of surgeons and leadership by example are key strategies in ensuring a sustainable fight against the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: and Relevance: With the varies strategies implemented, every surgical discipline and every surgeon to work together and place their desire to operate aside. There should not be any differentiation between surgeon and physician, but instead, everyone has to work together as one united health care front battling the common enemy – COVID-19.

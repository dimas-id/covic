The causative agents of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants and children are mostly thought to be viruses. Some ARI in adult patients may be caused by bacteria but most often the causes are virus infections. When ARI affect immunocompromised patients or the elderly the mortality rates are significantly higher than in immunocompetent individuals. Many types of viruses cause ARI. Among them, influenza viruses A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are thought to be the most important because of the severity of illness after infection and their high communicability in the human population. Recently, several novel antiviral drugs against ARI have been developed and some are proceeding in clinical trials. This review covers current investigations into antiviral compounds targeted at several points in the virus life-cycle. This includes PM-523, which broadly inhibits ortho- and paramyxo-viruses, two neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza virus, neutralizing antibody to RSV and chimeric soluble ICAM-1-IgA molecules targeted against rhinoviruses.

Species Survival Plans in North America--and comparable programmes in other parts of the world--address the management issues related to maintaining populations of endangered species in captivity. The need has been recognized for universal methods of assessing, evaluating, monitoring and preventing the transmission of disease to naive wildlife by reintroduced species. Standardized protocols are presented for evaluation of the health status of captive animals intended for release.

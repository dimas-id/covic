Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare condition with fatal outcome. Characteristic is rapid onset of liver damage without preexisting liver diseases, including hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. Early and correct diagnosis is essential for further management of patients, since diagnosis impacts therapy choice. Survival of patients with ALF has improved dramatically due to advances in critical care medicine and the use of liver transplantation.

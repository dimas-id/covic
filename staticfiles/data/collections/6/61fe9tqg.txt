This study looked at measurement of endotoxaemia as a tool in determining prognosis and probable response to treatment in scouring lambs. One hundred eighty‐three lambs in the first 15–20 days of life, from eight Merino sheep farms located in the region of La Serena, south‐west Spain, were used in this experiment. Scouring and normal/control lambs were selected following a clinical examination, the scouring group was further divided into subgroups, specifically those that did or did not survive 72 h following treatment. At the time of the clinical examination, faecal and blood samples were taken. Faecal culture and commercial faecal antigen tests for detection of enteropathogens in faeces and serum endotoxin measurement using chromogenic lymulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) were carried out. Scouring lambs received 0.07 mg/kg liveweight halofuginone once a day for 3 days, a single oral dose of 0.20 mg/kg liveweight of spectinomycin and oral rehydration fluid. The pathogens isolated were Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli. The case fatality rate was 51% in the scouring lambs. Postmortem findings were consistent with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection. The concentration of endotoxin was 0.18 ± 0.12 ng/ml in the control group, 0.35 ± 0.17 ng/ml in the surviving lambs and 0.46 ± 0.14 ng/ml in the non‐surviving lambs. Significant differences between groups were found. Case fatality rate of the scouring lambs with endotoxaemia below 0.30 ng/ml was 0%, while it was 100% above 0.50 ng/ml. These results may be utilized as a prognostic indicator in lambs affected by E. coli and Cryptosporidium that will help aid in decision‐making as to whether to treat a lamb or not based on its chances of survival.

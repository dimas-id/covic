Recombination is widespread among RNA viruses, but many molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are still poorly understood. It was believed until recently that the only possible mechanism of RNA recombination is replicative template switching, with synthesis of a complementary strand starting on one viral RNA molecule and being completed on another. The newly synthesized RNA is a primary recombinant molecule in this case. Recent studies have revealed other mechanisms of replicative RNA recombination. In addition, recombination between the genomes of RNA viruses can be nonreplicative, resulting from a joining of preexisting parental molecules. Recombination is a potent tool providing for both the variation and conservation of the genome in RNA viruses. Replicative and nonreplicative mechanisms may contribute differently to each of these evolutionary processes. In the form of trans splicing, nonreplicative recombination of cell RNAs plays an important role in at least some organisms. It is conceivable that RNA recombination continues to contribute to the evolution of DNA genomes.

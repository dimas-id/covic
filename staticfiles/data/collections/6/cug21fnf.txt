A system for evaluating the activity of antiviral agents against Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) has been developed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique. The activity of various antiviral compounds demonstrated in this assay system has been compared to their activity in the UV-XC plaque reduction assay, which has been used historically for evaluating anti-R-MuLV compounds. The assay is based upon detection of R-MuLV encoded p30 protein production in virus infected murine cells. The assay reagents are readily available and the assay system is amenable to automated data collection systems. Cytotoxicity evaluations are conducted in parallel to the Rauscher MuLV ELISA assay in order to assess drug-induced reductions in cell viability. Cytotoxicity evaluations are important to interpretation of the ELISA results since reductions in cell viability reduce viral protein production which would indicate an antiviral drug effect. This system is less sensitive than the classical UV-XC plaque reduction assay; however, it does offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive plaque assay.

OBJECTIVE To investigate factors affecting recurrence and effects and safety of endovascular retreatment for aneurysms recurrent after embolization. METHODS Among 815 aneurysms treated with embolization, recurrence was in 114 aneurysms (14.0%). Forty-three recurrent aneurysms were managed with re-embolization. Procedural complications, angiographic, and clinical results of retreatment were analyzed. RESULTS Patients with recurrent aneurysms were significantly (P < 0.01) younger than without recurrence (51.09 ± 10.46 vs. 53.88 ± 9.61 years). Recurrent aneurysms (n = 114) were significantly (P = 0.00) greater (11.12 ± 8.35 vs. 5.81 ± 3.44 mm) with a significantly (P = 0.00) greater neck (4.34 ± 2.26 vs. 2.90 ± 1.44 mm) than without recurrence. The rupture status of aneurysms significantly (P = 0.00) affected recurrence at follow-up. Significantly (P = 0.00) more aneurysms without recurrence were treated with advanced embolization techniques (81.0% vs. 62.3%) and got complete occlusion at the first embolization than those with recurrence (93.7% vs. 36.8%). In treating 43 recurrent aneurysms, stent-assisted recoiling was used in 48.8% in the first retreatment and 50% in the second and third retreatment procedures. Angiographic follow-up in 38 (88.4%) cases showed complete or near complete occlusion in 30 aneurysms, with the rest eight aneurysms experiencing a second recurrence (21.1%). Of the eight aneurysms with the second recurrence, five underwent the second endovascular retreatment, with complete aneurysm occlusion achieved in three cases (60%), near-complete occlusion in one (20%), and incomplete occlusion in one case at immediate angiography and six-month follow-up. Procedure-related complications occurred in three patients. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular retreatment of recurrent previously coiled aneurysms is safe and effective even though advanced embolization techniques are frequently involved especially for large and giant aneurysms.

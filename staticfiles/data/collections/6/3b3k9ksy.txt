Abstract Pasteurella multocida is a heterogeneous bacterium, which has the capacity to cause disease in a wide range of host species and is also recognized as an important zoonotic pathogen. Two sequential deaths in captive fur seals occurred at Sea World, Australia during December 2017. A fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia in a Subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) resulted in death within 24 h of nonspecific signs of illness, whereas a septic peritonitis in a New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) resulted in death within 12 h of clinical presentation. The cases happened within three days in two different pool locations, although both had previously been housed in the same area. A total of six Pasteurella multocida isolates were obtained from several internal organs at necropsy in both cases and were subjected to whole genome sequencing and phylogenomic analysis. In-silico typing of the isolates revealed that all belonged to Multi-Locus Sequence Type 7 and carried lipopolysaccharide outer core biosynthesis loci Type 3. Phylogenomic analysis of the isolates confirmed that the isolates were near identical at the core genome level, suggesting acquisition from a common source. The results also revealed the presence of within host and across animal diversity of P. multocida isolates for the first time even in a clearly connected outbreak.

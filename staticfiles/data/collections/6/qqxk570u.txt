Asthma is worldwide at pandemic levels for the past 30 years but is increasing at a greater rate in more affluent societies. It is a heterogeneous disorder caused by interaction between genetic predisposition, atopy, and environmental factors, including allergens, air pollution, and respiratory infections. The pathological aspects and pathophysiological mechanisms are reviewed in this chapter. Allergens or infectious agents may stimulate Th-2 inflammation which causes activation of IL-13, eosinophils, and increase IgE levels, subsequently leading to bronchial smooth muscle hypercontraction. Respiratory viral infections are well-known causes of precipitation of acute asthma exacerbations in 50–60 % of attacks. There is also increasing evidence that bacterial infections, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, may contribute to the onset and course of asthma. The two main hypothesis of microbial genesis of asthma that has arisen in the past 20–30 years appears to be incongruous, but are not, are the hygiene hypothesis of asthma, and the virus-related asthma, early onset of viral bronchiolitis in the susceptible hosts being responsible for later development of asthma. The clinical and experimental evidences to support these contentions are reviewed and critiqued.

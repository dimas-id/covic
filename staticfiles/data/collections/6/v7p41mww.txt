BACKGROUND The frequency of gastric tube cancers has increased with advances in surgical techniques and improvement of survival rates in patients with esophageal cancer. However, a standard surgical treatment has not yet been established. Total resection of the gastric tube with lymphadenectomy has been considered a radical treatment, while repeat surgery with both laparotomy and thoracotomy has been associated with severe complications, including anastomotic leakage, recurrent nerve paralysis, bronchotracheal injury, and damage to other organs. CASE PRESENTATION We present a successful case of a gastric tube cancer that was treated with surgical resection in combination with sentinel node biopsy. The tumor was diagnosed as a type 0-IIc lesion with ulceration, and was located proximal to the pyloric ring. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was not indicated because the primary lesion was submucosally invasive, and undifferentiated. By the dye-guided method, sentinel nodes were detected along the right gastroepiploic artery and vein. Intraoperative pathological examination revealed no metastasis of the sentinel nodes. Resection of the distal gastric tube was safely performed with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, preserving the right gastroepiploic artery and vein and the perfusion of the proximal gastric tube. CONCLUSION We suggest distal resection of the gastric tube with sentinel node biopsy as a novel surgical method for a cT1N0 gastric tube cancer located in the abdomen.

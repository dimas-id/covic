A small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors have demonstrated the novel modality for suppressing infectious diseases. Sixty-one siRNA molecules, predicted by the bioinformatics programs, were screened for the possibility of treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using an in vitro plaque assay. Among six siRNA leads with the efficacy of reducing plaque number, the siRNA targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced fever and virus titer in the Golden Syrian hamster and rhesus macaque. These results suggest the potential for RdRp targeting siRNA as a new treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

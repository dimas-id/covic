This study aimed to explore the role of miR-146b-3p in acute respiratory distress syndrome in septic mice. Ten mice were randomly selected as normal group (n = 10, without any treatment) and 60 septic mice with acute respiratory distress syndrome were divided into model group (n = 10, without any treatment), negative control (NC) mimic group (n = 10, injected with NC mimic), miR-146b-3p mimic group (n = 10, injected with miR-146b-3p mimic), si-NC group (n = 10, injected with PI3Kγ siRNA NC), si-PI3Kγ group (n = 10, injected with PI3Kγ silencing plasmid), and miR-146b-3p mimic + oe-PI3Kγ group (n = 10, injected with miR-146b-3p mimic + PI3Kγ overexpression plasmid). We found that miR-146b-3p negatively regulated PI3Kγ. Compared with normal group, model mice had decreased expression of miR-146b-3p, increased expressions of PI3Kγ, p-AKT, ASC, NLRP3 and Caspase-1 proteins, higher W/D ratio, and more serum IL-1β and IL-18 content (all P < 0.05). All indicators in miR-146b-3p mimic group and si-PI3Kγ group were significantly improved as compared to model group (all P < 0.05). Over-expression of PI3Kγ could weaken the treatment effect of miR-146b-3p mimic in model mice. Therefore, up-regulation of miR-146b-3p can inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to improve acute respiratory distress syndrome in septic mice.

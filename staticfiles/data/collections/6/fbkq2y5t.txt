Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining popularity worldwide. This retrospective cohort study evaluated the outcomes of a large cohort of patients with obesity who underwent LSG in a Bariatric Center of Excellence. All consecutive patients who underwent LSG between July 2013 and April 2016 were identified retrospectively. Preoperative and postoperative variables and comorbidities were recorded. The study consisted of 750 patients. Their mean age was 37.4 years; 72% were women, and the mean body mass index was 42.8 kg/m. The most common preoperative comorbidities were diabetes (23.3%), hyperlipidemia (21.9%), hypertension (21.1%), and obstructive sleep apnea (21.1%). The rates of comorbidity resolution during follow-up were 80.6%, 74.4%, 82.9%, and 94.3%, respectively. The percentage average excess weight loss 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 and 2 years after surgery was 29.4%±11.3%, 54.4%±17.7%, 76.9%±20.9%, 85.5%±23.6%, and 89.7%±27.6%, respectively. There was no mortality. LSG effectively and safely induced weight loss and comorbidity resolution.

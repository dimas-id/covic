In current sampling approaches, there exists a divergence between the surveillance of arthropod‐borne and that of non‐arthropod‐borne viruses. It is commonly held that the collection of vector specimens applies only to arbovirus surveillance and that the surveillance of non‐arboviruses must rely on traditional methods that involve the sampling of blood, faeces or saliva, or other examinations. The vector‐based approach is a sampling method that has the ability to survey both arboviruses and non‐arboviruses by distinguishing engorged vector specimens from entire vector samples. Accordingly, five arboviruses and three non‐arboviruses were detected in a study using a vector‐based approach conducted during 2012–2015. Hence, this report provides the first description of the Taiwanese vector species for the bovine arboviruses detected. The present investigations demonstrate that the vector‐based approach applies not only to the surveillance of arboviruses, but also has potential as a possible tool for monitoring non‐arboviruses on livestock farms in the future.

The expression and the role of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) components on regulation of cell volume and water transport on vertebrates and invertebrates were reviewed. The presence of these components even in simple organisms like leeches and their relevance for the control of cellular volume and water transport supports the view that the expression of these components, at cellular level, is an acquisition which was preserved throughout evolution.

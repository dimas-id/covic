A 57-year-old German woman with a history of skin reactions to unknown antibiotics, depression and high blood pressure presented with a 2-day history of symmetrically distributed pruritic pink-to-red maculopapular exanthema on the trunk and extremities. Due to a 3-week history of a nonproductive cough and intermittent fever she has taken amoxicillin, ibuprofen and metamizole three days before. She did not take aspirin or other anticoagulants. This prescription was discontinued and an intravenous bolus of prednisolone as well as anthistamines and topical glucocorticoids were administered.

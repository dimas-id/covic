OBJECTIVE To compare a 2-layer closure with suture line reversal for a pelvic flexure enterotomy to 1-layer and traditional 2-layer hand sewn closures. STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo, simple randomized study. SAMPLE POPULATION Large colon segments from adult horses (n = 18). METHODS Pelvic flexures were harvested from 18 horses and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 closure techniques (n = 6 per technique). A 10-cm enterotomy was made in each pelvic flexure and closed with the assigned technique. Closure time, luminal diameter via contrast radiographs, and bursting pressure were recorded for each specimen and compared between techniques using 1-way ANOVA with Duncan post hoc test at P < .05. RESULTS There was a significant difference in closure time (P = .034) with 1-layer closure faster than both the traditional 2-layer closure (P=.024) and the 2-layer closure with suture line reversal (P = .030). There was no significant difference in luminal diameter or bursting pressure between the 3 closure techniques. CONCLUSIONS Two-layer closure with suture line reversal may be an alternative to traditional 2-layer closure for closure of the pelvic flexure based on ex vivo bursting pressure testing and closure time. A 1-layer simple continuous closure resisted bursting pressure not different to both 2-layer closure techniques. Further in vivo evaluation may be indicated.

The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak that affected whole the world with more than 6 million confirmed cases and over 370,000 deaths. At present, there are no effective treatments or vaccine for this disease, which constitutes a serious global health crisis. As the pandemic still spreading around the globe, it is of interest to use computational methods to identify potential inhibitors for the virus. The crystallographic structures of 3CLpro (PDB: 6LU7) and RdRp (PDB 6ML7) were used in virtual screening of 50000 chemical compounds obtained from the CAS Antiviral COVID19 database using 3D-similarity search and standard molecular docking followed by ranking and selection of compounds based on their binding affinity, computational techniques for the sake of details on the binding interactions, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction; we report three 4-(morpholin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine derivatives; two compounds (2001083-68-5 and 2001083-69-6) with optimal binding features to the active site of the main protease and one compound (833463-19-7) with optimal binding features to the active site of the polymerase for further consideration to fight COVID-19. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds at the active site of 3CLpro and RdRp were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the three complexes remain stable during simulation of 20 ns, which may be suitable candidates for further experimental analysis. As the identified leads share the same scaffold, they may serve as promising leads in the development of dual 3CLpro and RdRp inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

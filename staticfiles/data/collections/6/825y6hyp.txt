In patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection the development of cytokine storm induces extensive lung damage, and monocytes play a role in this pathological process. Non-classical (NC) and intermediate (INT) monocytes are known to be involved during viral and bacterial infections. In this study 30 patients with different manifestations of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection were investigated with a flow cytometric study of NC, INT and classical (CL) monocytes. Significantly reduced NC and INT monocytes and a down-regulated HLA-DR were found in acute patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Conversely in patients with moderate symptoms NC and INT monocytes and CD11b expression were increased. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Synchronous multiple malignant colorectal lesions are rare, and there have been very few studies about one-stage laparoscopic operations in these cases. Here, we evaluated the short-term outcomes of laparoscopy-assisted colectomy (LAC) for synchronous double colorectal cancers. Seven patients underwent one-stage LAC that required two resections and anastomoses in our hospital from 2010 to 2014. We retrospectively examined each patient's background and subsequent surgical outcomes. The median age of patients was 78 years, and the median BMI was 19.8 kg/m2 . The median operative time was 190 min, and blood loss was minimal. All resected specimens were extracted through a transumbilical incision. A radical operation was performed safely without procedural accidents or postoperative complications in all cases. The median postoperative hospital stay was 12.5 days. One-stage LAC is considered a safe and viable procedure for resecting synchronous double colorectal cancers. It involves minimal invasiveness and is similar to standard LAC.

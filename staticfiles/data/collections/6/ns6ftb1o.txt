Nine unrelated 12-week-old naive domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were used to evaluate the serologic responses to commercial canine distemper virus (CDV) and rabies virus (RV) vaccines. Five of the ferrets (group 1) were inoculated 3 times at 2-week intervals with a multivalent modified-live virus vaccine of canine cell-line origin, containing CDV and an inactivated RV vaccine. Four of the ferrets (group 2) were inoculated once with the multivalent modified-live virus vaccine containing CDV and were not inoculated with the RV vaccine. Both group-1 and group-2 ferrets seroconverted to the CDV component of the vaccine. Group-1 ferrets also seroconverted after RV vaccination and maintained serum antibody titers to both CDV and RV for at least 7 months. Domestic ferret sera were found to have IgG epitopes similar to sera of domestic dogs and cats. Domestic ferret sera did not contain antibodies to feline coronavirus or FeLV antigens.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a means of cardiopulmonary support for refractory respiratory and cardiac failure. ECMO is a resource-intensive therapy that can be considered in highly selected patients. Expert centers should employ an evidence-based ARDS treatment algorithm and a multidisciplinary approach to recommending ECMO upon failure of conventional therapy. Caring for ECMO patients requires adequate infection control and safety precautions for healthcare workers.

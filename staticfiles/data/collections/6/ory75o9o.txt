Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health problem, with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 170 million. Current therapy for HCV infection includes the prolonged administration of a combination of ribavirin and PEGylated interferon-Î±, for over a decade. This regimen is expensive and often associated with a poor antiviral response and unwanted side effects. A highly effective combination treatment is likely required for the future management of HCV infections and entry inhibitors could play an important role. Currently, no entry inhibitor has been licensed for the prophylactic treatment of hepatitis C. Therefore, additional agents that combat HCV infection are urgently needed and must be developed. Many phytochemical constituents have been identified that display considerable inhibition of HCV at some stage of the life cycle. This review will summarise the current state of knowledge on natural products and their possible activities in the context of HCV infection.

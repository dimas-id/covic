Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become a major public health issue and is prevalent in most countries. We examined several MASP2 functional polymorphisms in 104 Brazilian patients with moderate and severe chronic hepatitis C using the primers set to amplify the region encoding the first domain (CUB1), a critical region for the formation of functional mannan-binding lectin (MBL)/MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP)–2 complexes, and the fifth domain (CCP2), which is essential for C4 cleavage of the MASP2 gene. We identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms in patients and controls: p. R99Q, p. D120G, p.P126L, p.D371Y, and p.V377A. Our results show that the p.D371Y variant (c.1111 G > T) is associated with susceptibility to HCV infection (p = 0.003, odds ratio = 6.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.85–21.70). Considered as a dominant function for the T allele, this variant is associated with high plasma levels of the MASP-2 in hepatitis C patients (p < 0.001). However, further functional investigations are necessary to understand the degree of involvement between MASP2 and the HCV susceptibility.

Abstract In vitro electrofusion of cells brought into contact and exposed to electric pulses is an established procedure. Here we report for the first time the occurrence of fusion of cells within a tissue exposed in vivo to permeabilizing electric pulses. The dependence of electrofusion on the ratio of applied voltage to distance between the electrodes, and thus on the achievement of in vivo cell electropermeabilization (electroporation) is demonstrated in the metastasizing B16 melanoma tumor model. The kinetics of the morphological changes induced by cell electrofusion (appearance of syncytial areas or formation of giant cells) are also described, as well as the kinetics of mitosis and cell death occurrence. Finally, tissue dependence of in vivo cell electrofusion is reported and discussed, since electrofusion has been observed neither in liver nor in another tumor type. Particular microenvironmental conditions, such as the existence of reduced extracellular matrices, could be necessary for electrofusion achievement. Since biomedical applications of in vivo cell electropermeabilization are rapidly developing, we also discuss the influence of cell electrofusion on the efficacy of DNA electrotransfer for gene therapy and of antitumor electrochemotherapy, in which electrofusion could be an interesting advantage to treat metastasizing tumors.

A free-ranging juvenile California sea lion ( Zalophus californianus) stranded on the coast of Vancouver, British Columbia, with signs of lethargy and emaciation in April 2016. An asymmetrical skull with a prominent superficial cervical lymph node was found on initial assessment. Fine-needle aspirates and biopsies of the lymph node were consistent with neoplasia and the animal was humanely euthanized and presented for necropsy. A metastatic parotid gland adenocarcinoma was diagnosed with regional lymph node and pulmonary metastases. Local invasion of contiguous skeletal muscle, bone, ear, and tonsils was extensive and likely accounted for the unilateral craniofacial deformity. Neoplasia of nonurogenital origin in juvenile California sea lions are reported infrequently. This is the first case of a parotid carcinoma in a California sea lion.

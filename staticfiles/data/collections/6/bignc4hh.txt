Paracardioscopy provides totally endoscopic access to the heart via a transabdominal, transdiaphragmatic approach. Structures such as the pulmonary veins, inferior vena cava, left and right atrial appendage, and posterior left atrium can be visualized. Epicardial cardiac procedures, such as ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation, can be successfully performed using this development. This report describes paracardioscopy.

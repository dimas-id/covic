PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction. METHODS: The study included 48 patients diagnosed with primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy surgery. Prior to dacryocystorhinostomy surgery, nasal swab sample was taken from the inferior meatus at the same side. During dacryocystorhinostomy, tissue biopsy sample (2 × 2 mm) was taken from the junction area of the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct. Following nucleic acid extraction, polymerase chain reaction was performed. RESULTS: The patients consisted of 9 (18.8%) men and 39 (81.2%) women with a mean age of 51.0 ± 14.3 years. Qualitative polymerase chain reaction showed viral genome in the nasal swabs of 10 (20.8%) patients, including coronavirus 229E (three cases), coronavirus HKU1 (two cases), respiratory syncytial virus (two cases), coronavirus OC43 (one case), coronavirus NL63 (one case), and adenovirus (one case). In the dacryocystorhinostomy samples, viral genomes were detected in four (8.3%) cases, including respiratory syncytial virus (two cases), coronavirus HKU1 (one case), and adenovirus (one case). There was a statistically significant agreement between nasal mucosal swab and dacryocystorhinostomy biopsy samples in terms of respiratory syncytial virus positivity (kappa = 1.000, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although the viral genome was detected in the samples, a direct relationship between viruses and pathogenesis of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction could not be revealed because of the low number of positive results. However, considering the profibrotic characteristics of specific viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, viral infections may be one of the many predisposing factors of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

Advanced age has repeatedly been identified as an independent correlate of adverse outcome and a predictor of mortality in cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-associated mortality may exceed 50% for persons aged 60 years or older. Heightened susceptibility of the elderly to severe SARS and the ability of SARS coronavirus to replicate in mice led us to examine whether aged mice might be susceptible to disease. We report here that viral replication in aged mice was associated with clinical illness and pneumonia, demonstrating an age-related susceptibility to SARS disease in animals that parallels the human experience.

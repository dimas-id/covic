The pandemic of the new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has urged the nations to an unprecedented world-wide reaction, including an accelerated exploration of therapeutic options. In the absence of a vaccine and specifically designed antivirals, the medical community has proposed the use of various previously available medications in order to reduce the number of patients requiring prolonged hospitalizations, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation and to decrease mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are among the proposed drugs and are the most widely used so far, despite the lack of robust evidence on their usefulness. The objective of this article is to review and discuss the possible role of these drugs in the therapy of COVID-19.

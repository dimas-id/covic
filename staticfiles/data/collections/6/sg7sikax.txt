Hydrocolpos presenting at birth in a neonate with a cloacal malformation may lead to massive distension, with compression of adjacent structures. At times, the hydrocolpos requires urgent drainage. Additionally, these neonates need a divided colostomy to divert their fecal stream and prevent genitourinary contamination. We present a novel approach by which these two procedures can be performed as a single operation guided by a combination of cystoscopy, colposcopy, and laparoscopy. This provides a minimally invasive technique with excellent outcome and potentially superior visualization of the necessary intra-abdominal structures.

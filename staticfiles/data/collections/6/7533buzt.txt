Studying the structure of RNA sequences is an important problem that helps in understanding the functional properties of RNA. Pseudoknot is one type of RNA structures that cannot be modeled with Context Free Grammars (CFG) because it exhibits crossing dependencies. Pseudoknot structures have functional importance since they appear, for example, in viral genome RNAs and ribozyme active sites. Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) is one example of a grammatical model that is more expressive than CFG and has the capability of dealing with crossing dependencies. In this paper, we describe a new inference algorithm for TAG(RNA,) a sub-model of TAG. We also introduce an RNA structure identification framework, TAG(RNA)Inf, within which the TAG(RNA) inference algorithm constitutes the core of the training phase. We present the results of using the proposed framework for identifying RNA sequences with pseudoknot structures. Our results outperform those reported in [14] for the same problem that employs a different grammatical formalism.

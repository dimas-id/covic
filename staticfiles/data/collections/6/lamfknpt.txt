Physical activity in children and adolescents should be strongly encouraged. While there is a very low risk of death associated with participation in athletics within this age group, the epidemic of childhood obesity and sedentary lifestyle must be combated to ensure the long-term health and quality of life of todayâ€™s youth. Sports-related deaths due to trauma are usually readily identified; others require careful examination, adjunctive testing, and/or the expertise of consultants. A thorough investigation of circumstances surrounding the death, review of the medical records, and autopsy is mandated in these cases.

An enhanced real-time polymerase chain reaction (ERT-PCR) assay to detect the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-Cov) has been designed for detection of SARS-Cov with high sensitivity and easy-to-interpret results, in which a target gene pre-amplification step preceded TaqMan real-time fluorescent PCR. The limit of detection of the ERT-PCR method was 10(-2) higher than the standard real-time PCR assay and 10(-7) higher than conventional PCR methods. The increased sensitivity of the assay would have major benefits in screening suspected SARS patients rapidly and efficiently and may help control the spread of SARS and other infectious diseases during future outbreak.

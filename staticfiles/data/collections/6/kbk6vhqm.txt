The COVID-19 pandemic seriously threatens the lives of the general public and poses momentous challenges to all medical workers, including those engaged in interventional radiology, who play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. To further standardize the prevention and control of nosocomial infections and ensure the safety of doctors and patients, the Chinese Society of Interventional Radiology (CSIR) organized multidisciplinary experts in the field of interventional radiology in China to prepare an "Expert Consensus" elaborating and summarizing the protective strategies and suggestions for medical workers in the field of interventional radiology when they engage in interventional diagnosis and treatment activities against the background of novel coronavirus infection control. The aim is to provide a reference for interventional procedures in hospitals and other medical institutions at all levels in China and worldwide. The key points include the following: (I) non-emergency interventional diagnosis and treatment should be suspended while work is ongoing to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19; (II) protective measures should be taken according to the appropriate level designated for COVID-19 infection prevention and control; (III) patients should take measures to protect themselves when they want to see a doctor, including accessing outpatient services online and other relevant channels of consultation.

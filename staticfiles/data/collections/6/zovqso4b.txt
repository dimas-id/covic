The COVID‐19 pandemic has produced unique challenges for society in general and healthcare workers in particular. For intensivists and anaesthetists the clinical workload has been incomparable, with multiple challenges for those providing frontline care. This has included staffing dramatically expanded intensive care units, redeployment, cross‐skilling and embracing new ways of working. It has also included involvement in many less high profile roles, such as hospital logistics planning, risk management and supply chain management to ensure critical care and emergency anaesthesia and surgery had space, staff, systems and equipment.

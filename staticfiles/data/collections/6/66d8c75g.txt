Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most critical pathogens in the poultry industry, causing serious economic losses in all countries including Iraq. IBV has many genotypes that do not confer any cross-protection. This virus has been genotyped by sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene. A total of 100 tracheal and kidney tissue specimens from different commercial broiler flocks in the middle and south of Iraq were collected from September 2013 to September 2014. Thirty-two IBV-positive samples were selected from among the total and were further characterized by nested PCR. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belong to four groups (group I, variant 2 [IS/1494-like]; group II, 793/B-like; group III, QX-like; group IV, DY12-2-like). Sequence analysis revealed nucleotide sequence identities within groups I, II, and III of 99.68 %-100 %, 99.36 %-100 %, and 96.42 %-100 %, respectively. Group I (variant 2) was the dominant IBV genotype. One Chinese-like recombinant virus (DY12-2-like) that had not been reported in the Middle East was detected. In addition, the presence of QX on broiler chicken farms in the area studied was confirmed. This is the first comprehensive study on the genotyping of IBV in Iraq with useful information regarding the molecular epidemiology of IBV. The phylogenetic relationship of the strains with respect to different time sequences and geographical regions displayed complexity and diversity. Further studies are needed and should include the isolation and full-length molecular characterization of IBV in this region.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged towards the end of 2019. World Health Organization (WHO) was identified it as a global epidemic. Consensus occurred in the opinion that using Computerized Tomography (CT) techniques for early diagnosis of pandemic disease gives both fast and accurate results. It was stated by expert radiologists that COVID-19 displays different behaviours in CT images. In this study, a novel method was proposed as fusing and ranking deep features to detect COVID-19 in early phase. 16x16 (Subset-1) and 32x32 (Subset-2) patches were obtained from 150 CT images to generate sub-datasets. Within the scope of the proposed method, 3000 patch images have been labelled as CoVID-19 and No finding for using in training and testing phase. Feature fusion and ranking method have been applied in order to increase the performance of the proposed method. Then, the processed data was classified with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). According to other pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models used in transfer learning, the proposed method shows high performance on Subset-2 with 98.27% accuracy, 98.93% sensitivity, 97.60% specificity, 97.63% precision, 98.28% F1-score and 96.54% Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metrics.

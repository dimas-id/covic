The inflammatory response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 infection has a direct impact on the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Of the many innate immune pathways that are engaged by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2, we highlight the importance of the inflammasome pathway. We discuss available pharmaceutical agents that target a critical component of inflammasome activation, signaling leading to cellular pyroptosis, and the downstream cytokines as a promising target for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019-associated diseases.

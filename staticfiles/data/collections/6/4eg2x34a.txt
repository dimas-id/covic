The COVID-19 global pandemic presents a challenge to orthopaedic education. Around the world, including in the United States, elective surgeries are being deferred and orthopaedic residents and fellows are being asked to make drastic changes to their daily routines. In the midst of these changes are unique opportunities for resident/fellow growth and development. Educational tools in the form of web-based learning, surgical simulators, and basic competency tests may serve an important role. Challenges are inevitable, but appropriate preparation may help programs ensure continued resident growth, development, and well-being while maintaining high-quality patient care.

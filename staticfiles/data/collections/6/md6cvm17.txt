BACKGROUND The study aimed at estimating the effect of body mass index (BMI), used to classify non-obese, obese, and morbidly obese patients, on clinical outcomes in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) cases. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 153 patients who underwent TLH for benign, premalignant, or malignant conditions between August 2010 and June 2013. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to BMI, and the following variables were analyzed: operation time, conversion rate, blood loss, total complications, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS The mean BMI was 33.5 kg/m(2) (range, 22-61). Forty-four patients were non-obese (BMI <30), 73 were obese (30≤ BMI <40), and 36 were morbidly obese (BMI ≥40). In 138 patients (90.2%), hysterectomy was performed using an endoscopic technique. The rate of conversion to laparotomy (9.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.1-14.5), blood loss (70.5 ml; range, 10-700), total complications (5.9%), and length of hospital stay (2.9 d; range, 1-8) did not vary according to BMI. Operation time was longer in obese (p = 0.003) and morbidly obese (0.002) patients than in non-obese patients. CONCLUSION TLH could be considered a safe and feasible alternative to abdominal hysterectomy in obese and morbidly obese patients.

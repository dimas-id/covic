Abstract Tropical settings present unique challenges to the practice of infection prevention and control. These are multi-faceted due to differences in the climate, culture, social, and political milieu of low- and middle-income countries situated in the tropics, as well as the lack of resources. The emergence of communicable diseases and low vaccination coverage also lead to nosocomial augmentation of community outbreaks, further increasing the economic burden of hospital management. Addressing these challenges requires innovative, low-cost, and tailored solutions suited to the tropical environment.

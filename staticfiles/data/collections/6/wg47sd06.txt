Ghanaian children (2176) aged <5 years who presented with undifferentiated acute respiratory distress were tested for respiratory pathogens using a BioFire FilmArray polymerase chain reaction assay. Rhinovirus and/or enterovirus was detected in 36% of the assays, respiratory syncytial virus in 11%, and parainfluenza in 7%. Respiratory syncytial virus and metapneumovirus were detected more frequently in the rainy season than in the dry season.

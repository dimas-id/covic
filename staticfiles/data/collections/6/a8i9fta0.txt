The article presents a new operation in the genetic algorithm. This operation mimics the epigenetic process of cytosine methylation. The Epigenetic processes have a huge impact on the functioning of living organisms, but have not yet been reflected in the operations of genetic algorithms. In a study on the evaluation of the operation mimics epigenetics process were used genetic algorithm for Knapsack issue.

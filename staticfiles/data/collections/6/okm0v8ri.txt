Oligodendroglial cell changes in human traumatic brain injuries and hydrocephalus have been reviewed and compared with experimental brain edema. Resting unreactive oligodendrocytes, reactive oligodendrocytes, anoxic-ischemic oligodendrocytes, hyperthrophic phagocytic oligodendrocytes, and apoptotic oligodendrocytes are found. Anoxic-ischemic oligodendrocytes exhibit enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and enlargement and disassembly of nuclear envelope. They appear in contact with degenerated myelinated axons. Hypertrophic phagocytic oligodendrocytes engulf degenerated myelinated axons exerting myelinolytic effects. A continuum oncotic and apoptotic cell death type leading to necrosis is observed. The vasogenic and cytotoxic components of brain edema are discussed in relation to oligodendroglial cell changes and reactivity.

Summary Background Current diagnostic tests are inadequate to detect typhoid cases, as well as the chronic carrier state, the sole reservoir of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The current study was conducted to find new molecular signatures of pathogen/disease to understand the mechanism behind the hostâ€“pathogen interaction in enteric fever. Methods Proteomics-based studies were done to determine the expression of differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of controls, acute typhoid cases, and chronic typhoid carriers. Further, transcriptome-based analysis using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was done in controls, acute typhoid cases, and chronic typhoid carriers. Results Results showed the upregulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin, furin, haptoglobin, and albumin in the plasma of chronic typhoid carriers. The elevation in mRNA expression of four differentially expressed proteins confirms the changes at the transcriptional level. Further, the increase in albumin and haptoglobin in chronic typhoid carriers shows their role in free radical generation, inflammation, and monocyte cell signaling. Conclusion Through proteomics techniques, this study identified four proteins in the chronic typhoid carrier host that may have a role in the disease pathogenesis of enteric fever.

The purpose of this study was to describe population knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19 and current social media coverage to address a gap in what is known about risk communication during health crises. A survey with 27 questions was developed. Twenty-three percent (N = 1,136) of respondents started the survey. Less than half of the students reported a high health literacy level (43%, n = 365/855). When asked where students have heard about COVID-19, the majority reported the Internet and social media. Students reported a basic level of COVID-19 knowledge, but few students (18%, n = 173/966) correctly identified all three signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19. Results highlight the need for an increased public health presence on social media and the urgent need to remain diligent in educating community members about COVID-19 myths.

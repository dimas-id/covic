Exposure of laboratory workers to infectious agents in the clinical microbiology laboratory continues to be an occupational risk. This risk is mitigated by the application of safety guidelines issued by regulatory agencies and professional organizations. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (fomerly NCCLS) published a guidance document (M29-A3) in 2005 on the risk of transmission of infectious agents in the laboratory, preventative measures to reduce risk, and management of exposure to infectious agents. The key to a safe workplace is employees who are knowledgeable of the routes of transmission of infectious agents in the laboratory setting and apply safety principles and work practices to reduce the risk.

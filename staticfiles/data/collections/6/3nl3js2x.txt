The utility of wearing simple cloth face masks is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics simulations. We simulate the aerodynamic flow through the mask and the spatial spread of droplet ejecta resulting from respiratory events such as coughing or sneezing. Without a mask, a turbulent jet forms, and droplets with a broad size distribution are ejected. Large droplets (greater than about 125 {\mu}m in diameter) fall to the ground within about 2 m, while turbulent clouds transport a mist of small aerosolized droplets over significant distances (~ 5 m), consistent with reported experimental findings. A loosely fitted simple cotton cloth mask (with a pore size ~ 4 microns) qualitatively changes the propagation of the high velocity jet, and largely eliminates the turbulent cloud downstream of the mask. About 12\% of the airflow leaks around the sides of a mask, considering a uniform gap of only 1 mm all around, between the face and the mask. The spread of ejecta is also changed, with most large droplets trapped at the mask surface. We present the viral load in the air and deposited around the person, and show that wearing even a simple cloth mask substantially decreases the extent of spatial spread of virus particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

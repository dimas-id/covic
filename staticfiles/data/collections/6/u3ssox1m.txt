Over the past decade, advances in endoscopic microsurgical techniques have resulted in an increasingly aggressive endonasal approach to tumors of the midline skull base. Meningiomas of the tuberculum sellae are often closely associated with cerebrovascular structures, and their removal has traditionally required a transcranial approach. An endonasal approach offers many advantages, including early tumor devascularization and tumor debulking (without manipulation of the optic apparatus), direct access to the medial optic canal, and a minimal-access corridor. Although recent articles have focused on techniques for reaching and approaching the area of the pathology (how to get there), the authors of this report discuss the technical nuances of endoscopic microsurgery when the operator is already "there." They describe their 6-step technique for endoscopic skull base bone removal, tumor dissection/resection, and closure. They also augment their description with elaborate illustrations.

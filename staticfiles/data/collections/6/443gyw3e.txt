Abstract Aims To assess the benefit of telemedicine consultation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Material and Methods A prospective study of patient satisfaction with telemedicine consultation was carried out in the ENT department of a university hospital center where telemedicine consultations were set up to replace scheduled out-patient consultations. Patients were divided into two groups according to overall satisfaction, in order to identify predictive factors. The significance threshold was set at p<0.005. The main endpoint was patient satisfaction after an ENT telemedicine consultation during global lockdown. The secondary endpoint comprised predictive factors for overall satisfaction. Results One hundred of the 125 patients with telemedicine consultation over a 7-day inclusion period completed the questionnaire. Overall satisfaction was 87%. There were no clinically relevant predictive factors significantly associated with satisfaction. Sound and video quality was satisfactory for 76% and 61% of patients respectively, without significant impact on overall satisfaction (respectively: OR = 3.40, p-value = 0.049; and OR = 3.79, p-value = 0.049). Lack of physical examination did not significantly correlate with reduced overall satisfaction (OR = 0.30, p-value = 0.027). Conclusion Telemedicine consultation did not allow complete medical care but, in a difficult time like the global pandemic, was well accepted by patients. It is a simple way to maintain continuity of care while reducing contamination risk by avoiding direct contact between patients and healthcare professionals.

In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised method for the parcellation of the Corpus Callosum (CC) from MRI images. Since there are no visible landmarks within the structure that explicit its parcels, non-geometric CC parcellation is a challenging task especially that almost of proposed methods are geometric or data-based. In fact, in order to subdivide the CC from brain sagittal MRI scans, we adopt the probabilistic neural network as a clustering technique. Then, we use a cluster validity measure based on the maximum entropy (Vmep) to obtain the optimal number of classes. After that, we obtain the isolated CC that we parcel automatically using SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) as superpixel segmentation technique. The obtained results on two challenging public datasets prove the performance of the proposed method against geometric methods from the state of the art. Indeed, as best as we know, it is the first work that investigates the validation of a CC parcellation method on ground-truth datasets using many objective metrics.

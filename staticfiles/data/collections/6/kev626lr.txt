We present a case in which video-assisted thoracic resection for intralobar pulmonary sequestration (ILPS) was successfully performed. A 36-year-old woman had repeated pneumonia. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a round mass in the right lower lobe of the lung. Subsequent three-dimensional CT revealed that a large anomalous artery arising from the descending thoracic aorta was distributing to the posterior basal segment containing the lesion and was draining into the inferior pulmonary vein. The patient was diagnosed with ILPS and underwent surgery. The anomalous artery was divided, and the sequestered segment was completely resected by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). We think that VATS resection for ILPS is feasible and is a major therapeutic option as noninvasive surgery.

This chapter discusses the current and future applications of monoclonal antibodies against bacteria in veterinary medicine. It discusses the existing applications of monoclonal antibodies, including the use of pilus-specific monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization of calves and piglets against enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infections as well as the development of rapid diagnostic test kits for field diagnosis of EPEC infections. The potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization against a variety of veterinary pathogens are passive immunization against Moraxella bovis (pinkeye), Bacteroides nodosus (foot rot), EPEC enterotoxin (enteric colibacillosis), Pasteurella haemolytica (pneumonic pasteurellosis), and Streptococcus equi (strangles). Three main areas of application for monoclonal antibodies against bacterial antigens in veterinary medicine are passive immunization, improved immunodiagnostics, and immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, because of their specificity, unlimited availability, and high titer, represent excellent passive immunizing agents. However, their potential usefulness in preventing infection must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery outcomes have been examined in Germany since January 1, 2005. All data were registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS The data were collected from an online data bank. Data collection began in 2005 for gastric banding (GB) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results. In addition to primary bariatric operations, data regarding the complications of revision procedures and redo operations were analyzed. Participation in the quality assurance study was required for all certified centers in Germany. RESULTS RYGBs are a popular redo operation after failed gastric banding. In the German Bariatric Surgery Registry (GBSR), we analyzed data from 263 RYGB operations that used a one-step approach after GB and 116 operations that used a two-step approach. The leakage rates for primary RYGB decreased to 1.8%. The incidence of leakage after a one-step RYGB after GB was lower (1.9%) than after the two-step procedure (2.6%). CONCLUSION RYGBs are popular procedures after failed GB in Germany. The multivariable analysis for overall intraoperative complications revealed a significant difference between the two-step and the one-step procedure. In an unadjusted and multivariate assessment, the one-step procedure had statistically lower general postoperative complications than the two-step approach. Therefore, we suggest performing band removal and RYGB as a one-step procedure. Further analysis is necessary to evaluate the risk factors for the one-step procedure. Follow-up investigations must be performed to determine whether RYGB is an effective and safe option after GB.

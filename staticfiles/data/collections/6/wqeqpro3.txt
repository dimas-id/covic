Often we think of collecting, storing, and using health data without patient consent as unethical and illegal. However, there are situations where the collection of health information without consent is not only ethical and legal, it is essential for community and public health. Public health surveillance – the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data with the a priori purpose of preventing or controlling disease or injury, or identifying unusual events of public health importance, followed by the dissemination and use of information for public health action – allows the government to meet its ethical obligation to protect the health of the population. By adhering to public health ethics principles, public health surveillance systems, including pervasive information and computing technology (PICT), can be designed and implemented in ways that both honor individuals and protect communities.

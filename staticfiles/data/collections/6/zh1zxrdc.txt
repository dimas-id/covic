PURPOSE The majority of studies on quality of life (QoL) of women with menstrual disturbances have not taken menstrual cycle phase into account. We aimed to determine the size of changes in QoL score during perimenstrual week compared to those during late follicular phase in women suffering from dysmenorrhea with or without premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and also to compare the two groups. METHODS In this observational analytical study, participants were selected purposively from among single students aged 18-30 years, who were residing at university dormitories in Tabriz, Iran, and had moderate or severe dysmenorrhea. They reported quality of their life during the past week using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) at two time points, days 3-4 and 11-12, of their menstrual cycle. RESULTS Among 52 participants with PMS and 64 without PMS, about half reported severe dysmenorrhea. The mean total quality score was significantly lower during perimenstrual week than during late follicular phase in both group with PMS [48 vs 79, mean difference - 31 (95% confidence interval - 37 to - 26)] and group without PMS [56 vs 78, - 1 (- 27 to - 18)]. The score was significantly lower in the group with PMS than in those without PMS during perimenstrual week [- 8 (- 13 to - 2)] but not during late follicular phase [2.1 (- 2.9 to 7.0)]. CONCLUSIONS Dysmenorrhea with or without PMS significantly reduces QoL of women during perimenstrual week. The QoL is slightly lower in group with PMS during perimenstrual week but not during late follicular phase.

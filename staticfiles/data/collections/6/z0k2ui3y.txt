Abstract Avian flu, influenza A subtype H5N1, is an emergent and virulent disease that poses a threat to the health and safety of the world community. Avian flu is 1 of more than 25 influenza A viruses that reside primarily in birds but also infect humans and other mammals. Avian flu is responsible for the current outbreak in Asia; H5N1 has now displayed probable human-to-human transmission; it could be a harbinger of a global epidemic. Anesthesiologists are exposed to a risk for infection when they are involved in airway instrumentation of infected patients. Given the evidence of emerging resistance to common antiviral agents used to treat H5N1 influenza virus and limited supply of H5N1 vaccine, prevention is our best protection. The following article will detail the virology and preventive public health practices for H5N1. This knowledge can also be used to define and prevent other yet unidentified infectious threats.

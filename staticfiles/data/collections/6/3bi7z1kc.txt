Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), extolled as the founder of modern nursing, contributed greatly to the advancement of modern public health. Written 150 years ago, Nightingale's advice on infection control, addressing the importance of hand washing, environmental sanitation, ventilation, sunshine, statistical data, and health literacy, remains highly relevant in today's global fight against the coronavirus. In honor of Florence Nightingale's 200th birthday, World Health Organization declared 2020 the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife. The era of "Nurses: A Voice to Lead - Nursing the World to Health" is drawing near. This article addresses the profound impact of Nightingale's infection control and public health perspectives on measures currently being taken to contain coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, we call on governments throughout the world to invest proactively in nursing to assure the safety of patients and promote public health in order to achieve the pledge of the United Nations' sustainable development goals to leave no one behind.

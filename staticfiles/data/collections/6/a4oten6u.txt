A mathematical or computational model in evolutionary biology should necessary combine several comparatively fast processes, which actually drive natural selection and evolution, with a very slow process of evolution. As a result, several very different time scales are simultaneously present in the model; this makes its analytical study an extremely difficult task. However, the significant difference of the time scales implies the existence of a possibility of the model order reduction through a process of time separation. In this paper we conduct the procedure of model order reduction for a reasonably simple model of RNA virus evolution reducing the original system of three integro-partial derivative equations to a single equation. Computations confirm that there is a good fit between the results for the original and reduced models.

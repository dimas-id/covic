Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes an economically important enteric disease of swine. Differences in the pathogenicity, antigenicity and tissue tropism have been observed among porcine coronaviruses. Although porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is antigenically similar but not identical to TGEV isolates, these respiratory coronaviruses differ markedly in pathogenicity and tissue tropism compared to TGEV isolates. Using a reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RT/PCR-RFLP) assay, TGEV and PRCV isolates were assigned to several distinct groups. By RFLP analysis of the 5' region of the S gene, TGEV strains were differentiated into 4 groups using the restriction enzyme Sau3AI. A fifth Sau3AI group contained the PRCV isolates. These 5 groups correlated with antigenic groups previously defined using monoclonal antibodies in our laboratory. Several restriction enzymes could be used to differentiate the TGEV strains into Miller and Purdue types. Analysis of a PCR amplified product in the 3 and 3-1 genes indicated the RT/PCR-RFLP assay results for TGEV Miller strains could be correlated with lower virulence created by passage in cell culture.

We report our initial experience with minimally-invasive esophagectomy in 32 patients at Carolinas Medical Center, a community academic medical center. Indications for surgery were adenocarcinoma in 27, squamous cell carcinoma in 3, and benign stricture in 2. Transthoracic Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy with laparoscopy and thoracoscopy was performed in 28, a 3-stage esophagectomy in 3, and transhaital esophagectomy in 1. There was no operative mortality and median hospital stay was 10.5 days for patients treated with minimally invasive esophagectomy. This compares with an operative mortality of 8.9% and median hospital stay of 17 days for open esophagectomy in our institution.

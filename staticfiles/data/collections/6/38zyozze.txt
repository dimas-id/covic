Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that has received increasing attention since the emergence of a PEDV variant worldwide. Previous studies have shown that PEDV ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein. However, its influence on cell cycle and subcellular structure still require more research. In this study, we developed a Vero cell line that stably expresses PEDV ORF3 gene. Subcellular localization and influences of PEDV ORF3 on host cells were investigated. We further verified whether or not this gene enhances virus production. The results showed that PEDV ORF3 protein localizes in the cytoplasm and affects cell cycle progression by prolonging the S phase. In addition, the ORF3-expressing Vero cells had more vesicles than the host Vero cells. Furthermore, the attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV could grow better in ORF3-expressing Vero cells. The expression level of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein also increased. These results provided information on the function of PEDV ORF3 and were helpful in understanding the mechanisms of PEDV replication.

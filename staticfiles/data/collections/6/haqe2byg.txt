It is suggested that the central strand which traverses plasmodesmata is in open continuity with the endoplasmic reticulum of adjacent cells, and that this strand (desmotubule) represents a modulation of a normal ER membrane so that it comprises solely spherical protein subunits. This concept is used to illustrate how plasmodesmata could form a median nodule or anastomosing central strands. The implications of this model in relation to current theories of symplasmic transport are discussed, and the possibility for further experimental work is outlined.

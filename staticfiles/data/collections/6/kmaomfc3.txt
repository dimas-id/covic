Success in providing respiratory support to the neonate requires a clear understanding of the context in which it is being applied. Perhaps more than for any other age group, the array of different situations in which ventilation is applied to the newborn infant is extremely broad, with in each case different pathophysiological disturbances and often the need to use a specific approach to apply ventilation optimally. Table 42.1 provides a list of the more common situations in which conventional ventilation is used in the neonate and includes some considerations regarding ventilator settings for each situation. For each situation, a suggested mode of ventilation is indicated, along with target ranges for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V (T)). Further discussion of the physiological rationale and available evidence for ventilator settings is set out below.

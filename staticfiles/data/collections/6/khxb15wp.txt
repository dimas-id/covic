Virus‐like particles, grouped in clusters not bound by a membrane, were seen in electron micrographs of fresh leucoblasts of an acute leukemic patient. They consisted of large (100‐nm diameter), round particles apparently composed of subunits. Tubular structures (30–50‐nm diameter) were also seen in leucoblasts of the same patient. The two types of structures were never seen simultaneously in the same cell. The authors review the literature pertaining to the morphology of virus‐like particles associated with malignant hematologic disease.

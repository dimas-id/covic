Abstract Background Total joint replacement (TJR) accounts for a substantial proportion of the total expenditures for health care. Efficient utilization of health resources requires information regarding the trends of TJR. This study investigated the association of TJR with the demographic characteristics in Taiwan from 1998 to 2009. It also estimated the demand for total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) in the next two decades. Methods International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) procedure codes were used to identify the data for primary and revision TKRs and THRs between the years 1998 and 2009 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Age- and sex-specific rates of such procedures were calculated. The trend in TJR rate and its future estimation were studied with regression analyses. Results From 1998 to 2009, the number of primary TKRs increased by 99.1% and that of primary THRs increased by 11.3%. The number of revision TKRs increased by 3.1% and that of revision THRs decreased by 13.2%. Compared with their respective rates in 2005, the rates of primary TKR and primary THR were projected to increase by 508.2% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2030. The rate of revision TKR was predicted to increase by 75.3% and that of revision THR to decrease by 36.1%. Conclusion This study gives an insight into the current status burden of TJR in Taiwan. TJR rate projection would be useful for future planning of budget and resources for TJR in Taiwan.

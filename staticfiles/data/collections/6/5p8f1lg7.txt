Deletion mutagenesis has been used to identify essential regions for rescue of coronavirus defective RNAs (D-RNAs). Using this technique on a cloned IBV D-RNA CD-91, we have identified a region potentially important in its rescue. Comparing the sequence of D-RNAs rescued with those not rescued we have deduced that a 72 base region corresponding to base number 13,824 to 13,896 in the viral genome is required for rescue. This may be an IBV D-RNA packaging signal or a cis-acting element involved in replication. Further experiments and modification of our techniques will be required to differentiate between the two processes.

Influenza is a source of mortality and morbidity, and vigilance of health authorities for flu viruses is high. The World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted that the first lines of defense against infectious diseases are behavioral, and risk perception affects behavioral measures. This study investigated risk perception of influenza and the role of sociodemographic and psychological variables on perceived risk. Participants were 442 adults. The research was conducted using three measures: an adjustment of the “Risk Perception of Infectious Disease Questionnaire,” the “General Self-Efficacy Scale,” and the short form of the “Italian Personality Inventory.” The results showed that age, education, self-efficacy, and personality influenced risk perception. The evidence that sociodemographic and psychological factors contribute to risk perception of a disease shows the need to take into account these variables in the planning of informative campaigns, with the aim to achieve favorable changes in public behavior. These issues might have implications for the ameliorating health communication efforts and successful response to new influenza outbreaks.

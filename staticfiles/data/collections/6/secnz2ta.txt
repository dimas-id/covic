Abstract Due to presence of secondary bioactive metabolites, natural compounds are considered a major source of new active molecules that can be developed as new drugs. Infectious diseases, and mainly the common respiratory infections, are major challenges to the current chemotherapy systems and, therefore, there is a requirement to find new compounds with therapeutic potential. The volatile natural compounds and essential oils are the main treasure agents in the natural compounds with antibiotic potential. The present chapter reviews natural traditional remedies used in the treatment of respiratory infections with the emphasis on antibacterial, antiviral, and antiinflammation activities of the volatile natural compounds (essential oils, etc.), and provides a brief view in some of structural activity relationships between antibacterial potencies and chemical structures of the essential oilâ€™s constituents.

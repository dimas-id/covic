BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting lives worldwide. The influence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medication and IBD itself on COVID-19 is controversial. Additionally, IBD focused guidance is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine COVID-19 prevalence/exposure, perception and information sources, medication compliance, patient behaviour and physician contact among patients with IBD compared with non-IBD controls. METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous survey of patients with IBD (N=415) at one university IBD clinic and one gastroenterology practice, matched 4:1 with control participants (N=116), was performed. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had high fear of infection. The fear was more pronounced in patients taking immunosuppressants and it extended to hospitals, private practices and public places, such as supermarkets. IBD patients reported leaving their homes less frequently than their peers without IBD. A total of 90% of patients with IBD reported washing their hands more frequently. Patients taking immunosuppressants were concerned about interactions between medication and COVID-19, whereas patients taking 5-aminosalicylates were not. Nonetheless, 96.4% of patients adhered to continuing their medication. Patients sought guidance primarily from television and internet news sites. Video consultations were found to be a suitable solution for a subset of patients who are young, have a high level of fear and leave their home less frequently than their peers, whereas overall acceptance of video consultations was limited. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD are significantly more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than their non-IBD peers, but they continue to adhere to their medication regimens. IBD focused COVID-19 information should be actively conveyed.

COVID-19 is a new viral emergent human disease caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus. This virus has caused a huge problem in the world as millions of the people are affected with this disease in the entire world. We aimed to design a peptide vaccine for COVID-19 particularly for the envelope protein using computational methods to predict epitopes inducing the immune system and can be used later to create a new peptide vaccine that could replace conventional vaccines. A total of available 370 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI for bioinformatics analysis using Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) to predict B and T cells epitopes. Then we docked the best predicted CTL epitopes with HLA alleles. CTL cell epitopes namely interacted with MHC class I alleles and we suggested them to become universal peptides based vaccine against COVID-19. Potentially continuous B cell epitopes were predicted using tools from IEDB. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed by AllerTOP tool and the coverage was determined throughout the worlds. We found these CTL epitopes to be T helper epitopes also. The B cell epitope, SRVKNL and T cell epitope, FLAFVVFLL were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19. We hope to confirm our findings by adding complementary steps of both in vitro and in vivo studies to support this new universal predicted candidate.

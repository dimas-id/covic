PURPOSE This umbrella review aims to evaluate the quality, summarize and compare the conclusions of systematic reviews investigating the impact of curative treatment options on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched independently by two authors from inception until 06 January 2020. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the impact of any curative treatment option on HRQol in MIBC patients were eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. RESULTS Thirty-two reviews were included. Robot-assisted RC with extracorporeal urinary diversion and open RC have similar HRQoL (n = 10). Evidence for pelvic organ-sparing RC was too limited (n = 2). Patients with a neobladder showed better overall and physical HRQoL outcomes, but worse urinary function in comparison with ileal conduit (n = 17). Bladder-preserving radiochemotherapy showed slightly better urinary and sexual but worse gastro-intestinal HRQoL outcomes in comparison with RC patients (n = 6). Quality of the reviews was low in more than 50% of the available reviews and most of the studies included in the reviews were nonrandomized studies. CONCLUSION This umbrella review gives a comprehensive overview of the available evidence to date.

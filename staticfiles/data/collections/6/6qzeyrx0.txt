A 53 year-old woman, who previously had a Burch colposuspension, developed osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis about 1 month after undergoing a laparoscopic 2-team sling with anterior and posterior colporrhaphy. The diagnosis was made on the basis of computed tomography-guided aspiration of the pubic symphysis, which was positive for group B Streptococcus sp. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of osteomyelitis after a laparoscopic retropubic sling procedure. Osteomyelitis is a rare postoperative complication in female pelvic reconstructive surgery but has been reported in cases where the pubic bone is used for anchoring. It is especially unusual in this case because the pubic symphysis was not used for securing the sling.

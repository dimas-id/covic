OBJECTIVE To present two cases of interstitial pregnancy treated successfully by use of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). DESIGN Case series. SETTING Department of obstetrics and gynecology at a tertiary health care facility. PATIENT(S) Two women with interstitial pregnancy requiring surgical treatment. INTERVENTION(S) Laparoscopy by use of LESS with the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Feasibility of LESS with the SILS system. RESULT(S) Two patients were treated successfully by use of LESS with the SILS system. After laparoscopic confirmation of the interstitial pregnancy, a cornual resection was performed with bipolar forceps and scissors for the first patient and with an automatic stapler for the second. CONCLUSION(S) Laparoscopic treatment of interstitial pregnancy by use of LESS seems feasible. Larger series are necessary to confirm these findings.

BACKGROUND Although natural orifice extraction is now widely performed, there have been no reports of this procedure following subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. This report describes trans-vaginal specimen extraction in four patients with early gastric cancer. METHODS The clinical data of four patients with early gastric cancer were reviewed. Totally laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy and D1 + Î² lymph node dissection was performed using five trocars and a conventional procedure. Posterior colpotomy was performed by an experienced gynecologist, who retrieved the specimens in a retrieval bag via the trans-vaginal route. The colpotomy site was repaired immediately following specimen removal. Reconstruction was performed using the intracorporeal Billroth II method and an endo-GIA 60. RESULTS Totally laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy and trans-vaginal specimen extraction was successfully accomplished in all patients without intraoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS The present technique may be a safe and feasible operative procedure for some limited groups of elderly female patients with early gastric cancer.

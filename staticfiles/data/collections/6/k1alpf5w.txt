Messenger RNA (mRNA)-transfected dendritic cell (DC) vaccines have been shown to be a powerful modality for eliciting antitumor immune responses in mice and humans; however, their application has not been fully optimized since many of the factors that contribute to their efficacy remain poorly understood. Work stemming from our laboratory has recently demonstrated that preconditioning the vaccine site with a recall antigen prior to the administration of a dendritic cell vaccine creates systemic recall responses and resultantly enhances dendritic cell migration to the lymph nodes with improved antitumor efficacy. This chapter describes the generation of murine mRNA-transfected DC vaccines, as well as a method for vaccine site preconditioning with protein antigen formulations that create potent recall responses.

Factors affecting immunogenicity of the first 2 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) among unimmunized Mayan infants were prospectively evaluated. The relative impact of multiple variables, including mass or routine vaccination, concurrent enteric bacterial (salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter) and viral (adenovirus 40/41, astrovirus, nonpolio enteroviruses, and rotavirus) infections, interference among Sabin vaccine viruses, and preexisting poliovirus antibodies were studied. Sera were available from 181 infants after 2 OPV doses. Seroresponses were 86% to Sabin type 1, 97% to Sabin type 2, and 61% to Sabin type 3 vaccines. Mass versus routine vaccination and preexisting poliovirus antibodies did not affect immunogenicity. By multiple logistic regression analysis, fecal shedding of homologous Sabin strains was associated with increased seroresponses to all Sabin types, especially to Sabin type 3. Decreased OPV immunogenicity was primarily attributable to interference of Sabin type 3 by Sabin type 2. OPV formulations with higher doses of Sabin type 3 could improve immunogenicity among infants in developing countries.

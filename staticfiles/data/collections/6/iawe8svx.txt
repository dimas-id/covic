BACKGROUND/AIMS Insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) during endoscopic sedation is only recommended in the event of respiratory problems. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of routine insertion of an NPA during sedation in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. METHODS Between July 2009 and April 2012, patients with colonoscopy or expected longer-lasting or therapeutic upper GI endoscopy were pseudo-randomized in a weekly alternating fashion to perform sedation (midazolam in combination with propofol) with or without NPA insertion. The primary outcome measure was respiratory depression (oxygen saturation <90%). Secondary measures included hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), bradycardia (heart rate <40 beats/min) or nasopharyngeal damage after NPA insertion. RESULTS 216 (106 females, mean age 60.7 Â± 9.65 years) were enrolled. Colonoscopy was performed in 131 patients and upper endoscopy in 85 patients. In 105 patients an NPA was used (intervention group). Five (4.7%) of those patients showed minor nasopharyngeal injury. Respiratory depression (13.5 vs. 1.9%, p = 0.002) and hypotension (11 vs. 5%, p = 0.09) occurred more frequently in the control than in the intervention group. CONCLUSION The routine placement of an NPA can reduce the frequency of hypoxemic events during endoscopic sedation with minor risks for nasopharyngeal injury.

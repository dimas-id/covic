PURPOSE The purpose of this work was to describe the results of a technique of simultaneous antegrade and retrograde vascular access ("criss-cross") to the popliteal vein to achieve venous recanalization in patients with acute, extensive, iliofemoral DVT with concomitant popliteal and calf vein thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven patients were treated using this technique, in three patients as a bailout option after failed posterior tibial vein puncture and in four as a first option. Antegrade popliteal venous access was performed according to the usual technique using duplex ultrasound (DUS) guidance and thrombolysis (CDT), or thrombectomy (PMT) was performed. Following this, the retrograde sheath was placed under DUS guidance, a tibial vein was selectively catheterized and CDT, and/or a PMT was performed. RESULTS Three patients underwent isolated CDT, another three had associated PMT, and one patient underwent iliofemoral PMT and catheter thromboaspiration of the popliteal and calf veins. Median thrombolysis duration was 72 h (24-72 h). SIR grade III thrombolysis was achieved in six patients and grade II in one patient. All patients underwent subsequent stenting of their iliac vein lesions. Minor complications were observed in two patients (ecchymosis), while one patient developed a hematoma on the popliteal fossa. CONCLUSION This "criss-cross" technique represents a safe alternative to the distal (anterior or posterior tibial) vein access both as a bailout option after failed distal venous access as well as a primary approach due to its potential advantage of clearing larger thrombus volume. Experience in ultrasound-guided popliteal vein puncture is crucial to avoid complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Case series, Level IV.

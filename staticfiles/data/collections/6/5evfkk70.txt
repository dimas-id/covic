I read with interest the recent article by Li et al (1) detailing the risk for COVID‐19 pneumonia and ABO blood group. After demonstration that group O healthcare workers were less likely to become infected with SARS‐CoV (2), a research group proved that anti‐A blood group natural isoagglutinins inhibit SARS‐CoV entry into competent cells (3) and could opsonize viral particles leading to complement‐mediated neutralization (4). Since SARS‐CoV2 uses the same receptor as SARS‐CoV, anti‐A isoagglutinins are expected to have similar effects against SARS‐CoV2: accordingly, clusters of glycosylation sites exist proximal to the receptor‐binding motif of the SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV2 S protein (5).

The aim of this study is to construct a SARS-CoV S protein-specific phage displayed antigen library for the epitope characterization of anti-S monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). First, the full-length gene of SARS-S protein was PCR amplified, purified and then digested with DNase I to obtain DNA fragments in the size range of 50-500 bp. The resulting fragments were blunt-end ligated to the modified phage display vector pComb3XSS. The reactions were electrotransformed into XL1-Blue and infected with VCSM13 helper phage. The SARS-CoV S protein-specific phage displayed antigen library was biopanned and screened against two anti-S mAbs, S-M1 and S-M2. The results showed that we successfully constructed the phage displayed antigen library with a size of 5.7 x 10(6). After three-rounds of biopanning, 14 positive phage clones for S-M1 and 15 for S-M2 were respectively identified. Sequence analyses revealed the possible epitopes of two mAbs. Therefore, the S protein-specific phage displayed antigen library provides a crucial platform for the epitope characterization of anti-S antibodies and it is highly valuable for development of SARS vaccines and diagnostics.

The idea that human bocavirus (hBoV) infection possibly plays a role in gastroenteritis has been suggested because of the frequent manifestation of gastrointestinal symptoms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hBoV in children with gastroenteritis. We studied the etiologic agents in 962 children hospitalized with gastroenteritis. Viral etiologic agents were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A viral agent was found in 44.4% of the study population: rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus were detected in 25.7%, 13.7%, 3.0%, and 1.1% of the study population, respectively; hBoV was detected in 0.8%, which suggests that it might play a minor role in gastroenteritis.

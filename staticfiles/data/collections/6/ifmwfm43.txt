Diabetes mellitus is a complex, multifactorial, chronic disease characterized by impaired metabolism of glucose, fats and proteins. Patients who suffer from it frequently have hyperglycemia and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The comorbidities associated with diabetes are overweight and obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and in some patients peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage, neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic lack of control of the disease is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which generally have few symptoms, but hyperglycemia is generally magnified, which worsens the course of infections. Since December 2019, when the disease caused by one of the coronaviruses (coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2) was identified and has been called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been some reports that associate the presence of diabetes with an increased risk of mortality. In this review article we have focused on four specific points: 1) epidemiology of the prevalence and mortality of COVID 19 in the general population and in the population with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2) pathophysiology related to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to receptors in subjects with diabetes; 3) the immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, and 4) the outpatient and hospital treatment recommended in patients with diabetes who become infected with SARS-CoV-2.

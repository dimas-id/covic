This chapter discusses the virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) and DNA vaccines. Mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as headache and drowsiness, can result from systemically elevated cytokine levels and therefore are common in many virus infections, even in the absence of the infection of the CNS. CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread. The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named. DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons. DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge. In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge. Several virus-induced CNS diseases may be explained by their triggering of autoimmunity. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a well-characterized CNS disease induced by the administration of certain CNS proteins.

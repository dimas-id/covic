We describe the natural history, viral dynamics, and immunobiology of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly lethal coronavirus infection. A severe recurrent infection developed, typified by viral persistence and acute lymphopenia, with waves of enhanced viral replication coinciding with fever, weight loss, and depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our combined observations suggest a model for FIP pathogenesis in which virus-induced T-cell depletion and the antiviral T-cell response are opposing forces and in which the efficacy of early T-cell responses critically determines the outcome of the infection. Rising amounts of viral RNA in the blood, consistently seen in animals with end-stage FIP, indicate that progression to fatal disease is the direct consequence of a loss of immune control, resulting in unchecked viral replication. The pathogenic phenomena described here likely bear relevance to other severe coronavirus infections, in particular severe acute respiratory syndrome, for which multiphasic disease progression and acute T-cell lymphopenia have also been reported. Experimental FIP presents a relevant, safe, and well-defined model to study coronavirus-mediated immunosuppression and should provide an attractive and convenient system for in vivo testing of anticoronaviral drugs.

Movement and haemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli during general anaesthesia are regarded as signs of nociception. We compared the Nociceptive Flexion Reflex Threshold (NFRT), Bispectral Index (BIS), Composite Variability Index (CVI), Noxious Stimulation Response Index (NSRI) and the calculated propofol/remifentanil effect-compartment concentrations (Ce) as predictors for such responses in 50 female subjects at laryngeal mask airway insertion and skin incision. The following prediction probabilities (PK-values) were obtained at laryngeal mask airway insertion and skin incision, respectively. For movement responses: NFRT = 0.77 and 0.72; p = 0.0001 and 0.004, respectively; BIS = 0.41 and 0.56, p = 0.29 and 0.5, respectively; CVI = 0.48 and 0.57, p = 0.76 and 0.88, respectively; NSRI = 0.49 and 0.76, p = 0.92 and 0.0001, respectively; propofol-Ce = 0.35 and 0.66, p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively; remifentanil-Ce = 0.68 and 0.72, p = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively. For heart rate responses: NFRT = 0.68 and 0.75, p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively; BIS = 0.37 and 0.59, p = 0.15 and 0.41, respectively; CVI = 0.41 and 0.44, p = 0.39 and 0.37, respectively; NSRI = 0.48 and 0.53, p = 0.84 and 0.78, respectively; propofol-Ce = 0.42 and 0.56, p = 0.39 and 0.53, respectively; remifentanil-Ce = 0.58 and 0.54, p = 0.35 and 0.73, respectively. We conclude that the NFRT best predicts movement and heart rate responses to noxious stimuli. Effect-compartment concentrations and NSRI also predict movement (but not heart rate) responses satisfactorily.

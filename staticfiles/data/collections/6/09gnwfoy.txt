Treatable diseases continue to exact a heavy burden worldwide despite powerful advances in treatment. Diagnostics play crucial roles in the detection, management, and ultimate prevention of these diseases by guiding the allocation of precious medical resources. Motivated by globalization and evolving disease, and enabled by advances in molecular pathology, the scientific community has produced an explosion of research on miniaturized integrated biosensor platforms for disease detection. Low-cost, automated tests promise accessibility in low-resource settings by loosening constraints around infrastructure and usability. To address the challenges raised by invasive and intrusive sample collection, researchers are exploring alternative biomarkers in various specimens. Specifically, patient-generated airborne biomarkers suit minimally invasive collection and automated analysis. Disease biomarkers are known to exist in aerosols and volatile compounds in breath, odor, and headspace, media that can be exploited for field-ready diagnostics. This article reviews global disease priorities and the characteristics of low-resource settings. It surveys existing technologies for the analysis of bioaerosols and volatile organic compounds, and emerging technologies that could enable their translation to the point of care. Engineering advances promise to enable appropriate diagnostics by detecting chemical and microbial markers. Nonetheless, further innovation and cost reduction are needed for these technologies to broadly affect global health.

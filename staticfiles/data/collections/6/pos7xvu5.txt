Abstract The spike (S) glycoprotein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the predominant inducer of neutralizing antibodies and has been implicated in virulence and host cell tropism. In this study, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene of one Korean field TGEV strain (133) isolated in 1997 and three Korean field TGEV strains (KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in 2000 and HKT2 strain, KT2 passaged 104 times in ST cells, were determined. The amino terminal half of the S glycoprotein gene including antigenic sites A, B, C and D, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Amplified PCR products were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published sequences for non-Korean TGEV strains. Korea TGEV field strains had 98.5–99.5% nucleotide sequence and 97.2–99.0% amino acid sequence similarity with each other. They had 96.5–99.0% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.9–97.6% amino acid sequence similarity compared to non-Korean TGEV strains. Korean TGEV strains had several specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences which were not found in foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. HKT2 strain differed by 0.89% in nucleotide and 2.03% amino acid sequences compared to original KT2 strain although the regions forming four antigenic sites were not changed. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean field TGEV strains were branched into different groups from non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains. Korean TGEV field strains KT2 and 133 were branched in separate groups that were differentiated from the other Korean TGEV strains. The Korean TGEV strains seemed to be evolved from a separate lineage of TGEV strain.

Abstract The present study aims atidentifying main barriers faced by people living with diabetes in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In a convenience sampling study, data were collected from 1701 individuals, aged 18 or above; 75.54% female participants; 60.73% T1D and 30.75% T2D, between April 22nd and May 4th, using an anonymous and untraceable survey containing 20 multiple choice questions (socio-demographic; health status and habits of life during COVID-19 pandemic). Relationship between variables was established using the multiple correspondence analysis technique. Results 95.1% of respondents reduced their frequency of going outside of their homes; among those who monitored blood glucose at home during the pandemic (91.5%), the majority (59.4%) experienced an increase, a decrease or a higher variability in glucose levels; 38.4% postponed their medical appointments and/or routine examinations; and 59.5% reduced their physical activity. T1D, the youngest group, was more susceptible to presenting COVID-19 symptoms despite not being testing; whilst the TD2 group had higher frequency of comorbidities that are additional risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Conclusions This study provides a firsthand revelation of the severity of COVID-19 on individuals with diabetes in Brazil, altering their habits, which impacted their glycemia, potentially increasing their risk of poor outcomes if infected by SARS-CoV-2.

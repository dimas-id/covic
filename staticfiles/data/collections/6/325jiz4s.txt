OBJECTIVE The overarching goal of this article is to provide radiologists with the most up-to-date information regarding the underlying epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and imaging findings related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a potentially deadly new infection. CONCLUSION An increased awareness of MERS-CoV and an understanding of the radiologic features of MERS-CoV can improve the early assessment and monitoring of this new infection. Radiologists can provide information based on chest radiographic and CT scores that can be helpful for patient management and predicting prognosis.

BACKGROUND There is a wide range of surgical procedures available to treat rectal prolapse that differ in approach as well as in principle. The current perineal approaches available involve mucosal or full thickness resection. There are currently no accepted procedures combining rectal fixation without resection using the perineal approach. We present our initial report of transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy for the treatment of rectal prolapse. METHODS A longitudinal incision was made in the posterior wall of the vagina. The rectum and sacrospinous ligament were identified. Two sutures were placed in the sacrospinous ligament and brought through a piece of Surgisis mesh previously anchored to the anterior surface of the rectum. This was performed bilaterally. These sutures were tied to complete the rectal suspension, and the posterior wall of the vagina was closed. RESULTS Transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy was performed in all seven cases. In the first two cases, a Delorme procedure was performed concurrently. Two patients had rubber band ligation for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids, one patient had a sphincter plication, and one patient had an anal encirclement procedure with Surgisis. Six of the seven patients had concomitant urologic procedures. The average operative time was 163 min, and the average blood loss was 107 mL. None of the cases required conversion to an open procedure. There was one full thickness recurrence at 18 weeks. CONCLUSION Transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy is a safe, minimally invasive, technically feasible technique for the treatment of rectal prolapse.

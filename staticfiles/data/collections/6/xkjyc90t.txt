Rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2 is fundamental to assess viral spread and limit the pandemic we are facing. In this study we evaluated the reliability and the efficiency of a direct RT-QPCR method (without RNA extraction) using SeeGene Allplex™ 2019-nCoV RT-QPCR and the influence of swab storage media composition on further viral detection. We show that SeeGene’s assay provides similar efficiency as the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit (Altona Diagnostics), and that RNA extraction is not necessary nor advantageous if samples are stored in UTM or molecular water but is recommended if samples are stored in saline solution and in Hanks medium.

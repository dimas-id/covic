BACKGROUND Laparoscopic extraperitoneal adenomectomy is occasionally performed for symptomatic large-volume benign prostatic hyperplasia. Two different multichannel ports were used during operations. We describe the technique of single-port extraperitoneal transvesical adenomectomy and present the initial operative experience. METHODS Three patients in whom an open adenomectomy was indicated underwent single-port extraperitoneal transvesical adenomectomy. Following preparation of the extraperitoneal space via an umbilical incision, a multichannel port was inserted. A transverse cystotomy adjacent to the prostatovesical junction, incision of mucosa overlying the adenoma, subcapsular plane development, prostatic adenomectomy and cystotomy repair were performed as the standard steps of the laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS All cases were completed without conversion to standard laparoscopy. Mean operative time was 105 min. Mean blood loss was 190 ml. Hospital stay was 4 days and catheter duration was 6 days for all patients. No intraoperative or postoperative complication occurred. CONCLUSIONS Single-port extraperitoneal transvesical adenomectomy for large benign prostate hyperplasia is feasible with excellent cosmetic results and minimal morbidity.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had a rapid and significant impact on mobility. One of the most important responses of countries worldwide to slow the spread of the pandemic has been to restrict the movement of people, which has had a considerable effect on transport systems. However, the reduction of transport is not identical for all modes of transport: public transport has seen the greatest decline by far. Understanding urban modal share developments during a pandemic situation can help cities better prepare for transport management in the future.

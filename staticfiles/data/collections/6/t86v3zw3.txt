Globally, there are over 33 million persons living with HIV/AIDS resulting in 1.8 million deaths annually. While the rate of HIV transmission is slowing, it is estimated that 2.6 million new infections occur yearly [1]. In the United States, there are approximately 1.2 million living with HIV/AIDS, with 50,000 new HIV infections and 17,000 deaths from the disease annually [2]. For those who can obtain effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV/AIDS has become a chronic disease with life expectancies over 30 years [3]. Research in the last 10 years has revealed the importance of alcohol in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Alcohol use, in moderate or hazardous amounts, has been associated with increased acquisition of HIV infection, progression of HIV infection, deleterious effects on HIV treatment, and acceleration in the comorbidities of HIV infection [4–9]. Yet alcohol remains the “forgotten drug” of the HIV/AIDS epidemic [10].

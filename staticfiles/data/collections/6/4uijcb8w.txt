AIM The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the Glidescope(®) in a manikin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) scenario. METHODS Following a brief didactic session, 45 volunteer doctors inexperienced with airway management, attempted to intubate a manikin using a Macintosh laryngoscope and Glidescope(®) with uninterrupted and without chest compressions. Primary endpoints were intubation times and success rate with each device. Dental compression and level of self-confidence in using each device were also assessed. RESULTS In the scenario without chest compressions the cumulative success rate related to time to intubation was significantly higher with the Macintosh blade than with the Glidescope(®) (p<0.001). On the contrary, in the scenario with continuous chest compressions, the cumulative rate related to time to intubation was significantly higher with the Glidescope(®) (p=0.035). Significantly fewer attempts were required for the first successful intubation with the Macintosh blade in the non-CPR scenario versus the CPR scenario (p=0.007). Moreover, the number of attempts for the first successful intubation was significantly lower for the Glidescope(®) in the non-CPR (p=0.001) and the CPR scenario (p<0.001). Dental compression was significantly lower with the Glidescope(®) in both scenarios (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Using the GlideScope(®) in a manikin CPR scenario provides extremely high intubation success rates in short times with the first attempt, in medical practitioners inexperienced in intubation.

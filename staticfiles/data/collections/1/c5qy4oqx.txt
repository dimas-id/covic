The trend toward single-family room (SFR) design in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has been driven by a growing understanding of the developmental needs of preterm infants, a desire to provide environments that support and encourage family participation, and infection control considerations. SFR design offers many potential benefits, but also requires substantial change in the NICU culture, as well as additional space and technology when compared to an open ward. The advantages and drawbacks of the SFR design are reviewed, and strategies are offered to assist those who are considering construction or renovation of an NICU.

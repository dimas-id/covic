INTRODUCTION: We report a case of an adult patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria that was successfully managed with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). CASE REPORT: A 25 year old male with no significant past medical history had been admitted to a local hospital due to dyspnea and fever. His pulmonary function subsequently failed necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) and introduction of ECMO support. The patient was transported for 300 km by road on ECMO to a tertiary medical center. The diagnosis of ARDS, HIV infection and MDR bacterial and fungal VAP was made. Patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), anti-infective agents and 58 days of veno-venous ECMO support, with complete resolution of the respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: HIV infected patients with ARDS and MDR bacterial VAP whose HIV replication is controlled by ART could be successfully managed with ECMO.

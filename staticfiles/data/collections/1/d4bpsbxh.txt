As the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection spreads globally, physicians and physician-scientists are confronted with an enlarging body of literature about the nature of this pandemic. Understanding the current epidemiological models for disease spread, mortality, and recovery is more important than ever before. One of the most relevant mathematical models relating to the spread of a pandemic is the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model. Other models worth exploring are the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) and the susceptible-unquarantined-quarantined-confirmed (SUQC) model.

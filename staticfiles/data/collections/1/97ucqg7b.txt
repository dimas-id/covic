Abstract Background Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the management and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empiric therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients. Research Question There is no concensus regarding the initial management of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP. Study Design and Methods This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the management of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus. Results The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiological work-up, general principles of empiric therapy, and empiric therapy for specific pathogens. Interpretation This document offer general suggestions for the initial management of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

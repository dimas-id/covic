Abstract Angiogenesis is a multi-step process regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Inhibition of angiogenesis is a potential anti cancer treatment strategy that is now investigated clinically. In addition, advances in the understanding of the angiogenic process have led to the development of new angiogenesis therapies for ischemic heart disease. Currently, researchers search for objective measures that indicate pharmacological responses to pro- and anti-angiogenic drugs and therefore, there is a great interest in techniques to visualize angiogenesis noninvasively. As CD13 is selectively expressed in angiogenic blood vessels, it can serve as a target for molecular imaging tracers to noninvasively visualize angiogenic processes in animal models and patients. Here, an overview on the currently used CD13 targeted molecular imaging probes for noninvasive visualization of angiogenesis is given.

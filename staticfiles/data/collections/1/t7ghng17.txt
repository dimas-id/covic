Neonatal infections continue to cause morbidity and mortality in infants. Among approximately 400,000 infants followed nationally, the incidence rates of early-onset sepsis infection within 3 days of life are 0.98 cases per 1000 live births. Newborn infants are at increased risk for infections because they have relative immunodeficiency. This article provides evidence-based practical approaches to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of neonatal infections.

PURPOSE Understanding the quality of evidence of delirium education studies will assist in designing future education interventions that seek to improve the well-known deficits in delirium prevention, detection and care. The aim of this study is to systematically review the methodological strengths and limitations, as well as the impact of delirium educational interventions for healthcare professionals working in inpatient settings. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL databases were searched according to PRISMA guidelines for delirium educational interventions in hospital inpatient settings from 2007 to 2017. Identified studies were rated using a standardised quality assessment criteria checklist (Kmet). Reported outcomes were organised by level on the Kirkpatrick model for educational outcomes. The search was repeated in March 2018. RESULTS 1354 papers were screened, of which 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions delivered included face-to-face education (n = 34), e-learning (n = 8) and interprofessional education (n = 8). Quality of studies varied in Kmet score (14-96%). There were 17 high-quality studies (Kmet > 80%) and 4 very high-quality studies (Kmet over > 90%). Thirty-eight studies (90%) reported improved outcomes post-intervention. In terms of Kirkpatrick level of educational outcomes, 6 studies were rated at level 1; 13 studies at level 2; 15 studies at level 3; and 8 studies at level 4. Thirteen studies measured intervention sustainability with variable impacts. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professional education has benefits for inpatient delirium care, as shown by the high number of good-quality studies and the majority demonstrating improved outcomes post-intervention. The sustainability of educational interventions warrants further exploration.

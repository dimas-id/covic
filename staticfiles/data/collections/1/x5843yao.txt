BACKGROUND: Identification of risk factors of severe Covid-19 is critical for improving therapies and understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. METHODS: We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. RESULTS: The majority of Covid-19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non-diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, PreDM and obesity. Covid-19 is asociated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies. This article is protected by copyright.

In the last ten years the mutant athymic nude mouse has been used by many researchers as a model for studying pathological conditions in an immunodeficient host. A major problem with such mice is their susceptibility to viral infections indigenous to murine stocks, such as the hepatotropic mouse coronaviruses. In an effort to define the hepatotropic virus diseases indigenous to nude mice this paper details the pathogenesis and associated comparative histopathology of three common strains of mouse hepatitis virus, reovirus 3 and murine cytomegalovirus in the nude mouse.

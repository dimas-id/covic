ACE2 is not only an enzyme that counters the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) but is also the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some experimental data suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs increase ACE2 levels, thus raising concerns on their security in Covid-19 positive patients. However, some studies have shown protection by these drugs in lower tract respiratory infections and ARDS. The actual consensus is to continue the treatment with RAAS inhibitors, abrupt withdrawal, especially in patients with cardiac or renal conditions, being hazardous in terms of cardiovascular outcomes, except in patients hospitalized in intensive care with hemodynamic instability. This position statement is actually unanimous among all international learned societies.

AIM Stapled haemorrhoidopexy has gained wide acceptance due to less postoperative pain although postoperative bleeding and prolapse recurrence are among the major drawbacks of this technique compared with the standard Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy. The aim was to investigate a new stapler device designed to overcome these side effects. METHOD In all, 135 patients (71 men, mean age 42 years) with degree III haemorrhoids were randomly allotted to stapled haemorrhoidopexy with PPH® staplers (Ethicon EndoSurgery) (63 patients) or with an EEA® stapler (Covidien) (72 patients) in four referral colorectal centres. The number of haemostatic overstitches apposed on the stapled suture, the area of the resected mucosa (in square centimetres) and any postoperative bleeding within 30 days were recorded. RESULTS The mean area of the resected mucosa was significantly wider in EEA than PPH patients (35.75 ± 17.51 vs 28.05 ± 10.23 cm(2), P = 0.002). The median number of haemostatic stitches apposed in the EEA group was significantly lower than in the PPH groups (median value 1, vs 3, interquartile range 0-2, vs 2-5, P < 0.0001). Intraoperative haemostasis was better in the EEA group compared with the PPH01 and PPH03 groups. Postoperative bleeding occurred only in two PPH patients. CONCLUSION Data suggest that the EEA stapler has better haemostatic properties than the PPH stapler and allows resection of a larger area of mucosal prolapse with potential benefits over the recurrence rate of haemorrhoid prolapse.

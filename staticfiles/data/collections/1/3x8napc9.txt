Abstract Deletions were made in an infectious cDNA clone of alfalfa mosaic virus (AIMV) RNA3 and the replication of RNA transcripts of these cDNAs was studied in tobacco plants transformed with AIMV replicase genes (P12 plants). Previously, we found that deletions in the P3 gene did not affect accumulation of RNA3 in P12 protoplasts whereas deletions in the coat protein (CP) gene reduced accumulation 100-fold (A. C. van der Kuyl, L. Neeleman, and J. F. Bol, 1991, Virology 183, 687â€“694). In P12 plants deletions in the P3 gene reduced accumulation by about 200-fold and accumulation of CP deletion mutants was not detectable. When P12 plants were inoculated with a mixture of P3- and CP-deletion mutants, both mutants replicated efficiently and various amounts of full-length RNA3 molecules were formed by recombination. The observation that some P3 and CP mutants did not recombine at a detectable level after several passages in P12 plants demonstrated that mutations in the AIMV P3 and CP genes can be complemented in trans.

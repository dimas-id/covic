Background: There are limited reports describing critically ill COVID-19 patients in New York. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 32 adult critically ill patients admitted to a tertiary community hospital in upstate NY, between March 14th and April 12th, 2020. We collected demographic, laboratory, ventilator, and treatment data, which were analyzed and clinical outcomes tabulated. Results: 32 patients admitted to the ICU were included, with mean ({+/-}SD) follow-up duration 21 {+/-} 7 days. Mean ({+/-}SD) age was 62.2 {+/-} 11.2 years, and 62.5% were men. 27 (84.4%) of patients had one or more medical co-morbidities and 50% of the patients were current or former smokers. The mean ({+/-}SD) duration of symptoms was 6.6 ({+/-}4.4) days before presentation, with cough (81.3%), dyspnea (68.7%), and fever (65.6%) being most common. 23 (71.9%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. 5 (15.6%) had died, 11 (34.4%) had been discharged home, and 16 (50%) remained hospitalized, 8 (25%) of which were still in ICU. Mean ({+/-}SD) length of ICU stay was 10.2 ({+/-}7.7) days, and mean ({+/-}SD) length of hospital stay was 14.8 ({+/-}7.7) days. Conclusion: Majority of patients were of older age and with medical co-morbidities. With adequate resource utilization, mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients may not be as high as previously suggested.

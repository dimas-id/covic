STUDY DESIGN This is a technique article discussing 3 alternative frames for casting children with infantile scoliosis. OBJECTIVE To provide surgeons with alternatives to expensive specialized casting tables to allow local treatment of these children utilizing readily available materials present at most institutions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND Casting for infantile scoliosis has become more popular as reports have shown promising results with this technique without the morbidity and complications associated with more invasive procedures. However, without a specialized casting table, treating these patients has been limited to a few centers throughout the country often causing patients to travel large distances to receive care. METHODS Three different alternatives to commercially available casting frames are presented. Requirements, setup, and techniques are discussed. RESULTS Each surgeon has had success with each of these frames. These provide adequate support and traction while allowing enough access to the trunk to apply a well-molded cast. CONCLUSIONS Cotrel/Metha casting for infantile scoliosis can be accomplished without a specialized table using commonly available equipment.

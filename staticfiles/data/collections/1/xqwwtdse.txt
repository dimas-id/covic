This chapter provides a perspective on the evolution of the field of plant-based vaccine from the limitations identified in initial developments as to how this biotechnological approach has become sophisticated via the development of new technologies and has gained industry interest. Perspectives for the field at both the basic research and the industrial level are emphasized. Perspectives considered of relevance in terms of basic research include (1) advancing the development of oral formulations, (2) expanding the modalities of expression of immunogens, (3) diversifying production platforms, particularly those performed under full containment, and (4) targeting a broader number of diseases. These goals are expected to multiply the expectations for benefits derived from plant-based vaccine-production technology. On the other hand, technology transfer and regulatory issues represent a critical hurdle to this technology becoming a reality. It is also critical to achieve social acceptance as well as implement initiatives for the exploitation of the technology for humanitarian purposes and for the benefit of poor countries. This overview predicts considerable potential for plant-based vaccines to positively impact the field of vaccinology in the near future.

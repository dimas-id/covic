Introduction: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are segments of nucleic acid that play a role in prokaryotic defense and form the basis of a genome editing technology that allows permanent alteration of genetic material. This methodology, known as CRISPR-Cas9, is poised to revolutionize molecular biology, but no literature yet exists on how these advances will affect hospitalists. Areas covered: These specialists in inpatient medicine care for a wide variety of hospitalized patients, including those with infectious disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, hematologic disease, and a variety of other conditions that may soon be impacted by advances in gene-modifying technology provided by CRISPR-Cas9. A Literature search was performed using PubMed [1 December 2019â€“17 April 2020]. Expert opinion: This paper reviews the remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the CRISPR-Cas9 platform and concludes with a look at ethical issues and technical hurdles pertaining to the implementation of permanent gene modification in the practice of Hospital Medicine.

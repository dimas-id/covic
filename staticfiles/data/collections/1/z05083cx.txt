Phospholipase A2 enzymes have long been implicated in the promotion of inflammation by mobilizing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, yet recent evidence suggests that they also contribute to anti-inflammatory or pro-resolving programs. Group IID-secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IID) is abundantly expressed in dendritic cells in lymphoid tissues and resolves the Th1 immune response by controlling the steady-state levels of anti-inflammatory lipids such as docosahexaenoic acid and its metabolites. Here, we show that psoriasis and contact dermatitis were exacerbated in Pla2g2d-null mice, whereas they were ameliorated in Pla2g2d-overexpressing transgenic mice, relative to littermate wild-type mice. These phenotypes were associated with concomitant alterations in the tissue levels of Ï‰3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites, which had the capacity to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory and Th1/Th17-type cytokines in dendritic cells or lymph node cells. In the context of cancer, however, Pla2g2d deficiency resulted in marked attenuation of skin carcinogenesis, likely because of the augmented anti-tumor immunity. Altogether, these results underscore a general role of sPLA2-IID as an immunosuppressive sPLA2 that allows the microenvironmental lipid balance toward an anti-inflammatory state, exerting beneficial or detrimental impact depending upon distinct pathophysiological contexts in inflammation and cancer.

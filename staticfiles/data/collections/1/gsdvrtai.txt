With change in global concern toward food quality over food quantity, consumer concern and choice of healthy food has become a matter of prime importance. It gave rise to concept of “personalized or precision nutrition”. The theory behind personalization of nutrition is supported by multiple factors including advances in food analytics, nutrition based diseases and public health programs, increasing use of information technology in nutrition science, concept of gene-diet interaction and growing consumer capacity or concern by better and healthy foods. The advances in “omics” tools and related analytical techniques have resulted into tremendous scope of their application in nutrition science. As a consequence, a better understanding of underlying interaction between diet and individual is expected with addressing of key challenges for successful implementation of this science. In this chapter, the above aspects are discussed to get an insight into driving factors for increasing concern in personalized nutrition.

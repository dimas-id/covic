Background: During public health emergencies, the Military Health System experiences challenges similar to those across the U.S. public and private health systems. This study explored how 1 such event, the 2009/2010 influenza (H1N1) pandemic, impacted health care utilization and associated costs in the Military Health System. Methods: Data from the Military Data Repository were used to examine diagnoses, claims data, and dates of services with respect to military or civilian care during 2004â€“2009/2010 influenza seasons. Comparison analysis was conducted through two-tailed t-tests and regression models. Results: There was a significant increase in inpatient and outpatient health care utilization during the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic year, most markedly for emergency department visits. The 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic cost the Department of Defense $100 million compared to influenza-related health care costs incurred in previous influenza seasons. Highest health care utilization costs were found in children less than age 5. The greatest cost burden was attributed to immunizations for active duty personnel delivered at military facilities. Conclusion: Annual trend analysis of costs and health care utilization would be helpful to plan and resource emerging influenza pandemics and to identify subgroups at greatest risk for contracting influenza.

Portal vein (PV) thrombosis (PVT) in the absence of liver disease or thrombophilia is rare. We report a 57-year-old male with a history of stage 3 chronic kidney disease who presented at the emergency department 18 months after abdominal surgery with progressive abdominal pain and distention. Computed tomography revealed PVT with multiple collaterals and moderate ascites. He had undergone partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunal anastomosis at an outside facility for gastrointestinal stromal tumors that caused an iatrogenic stenotic lesion in the PV. The patient underwent balloon angioplasty and endovascular deployment of an 8 mm Ã— 100 mm Viabahn covered stent (W. L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona) in the extrahepatic PV via a transhepatic approach; the device allowed complete restoration of prograde portal flow with clinical improvement. At 6 months from the intervention, he remains symptom-free with normal liver function tests and patent endoprosthesis on antiplatelet therapy.

Diagnostic tools are essential for the physician to reach a correct diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, to determine the pathogen, and to estimate the prognosis of individual patients. X-ray of the chest remains the “gold standard” for identification of pneumonia. Modern inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and in the future procalcitonin are essential for the differential diagnosis and follow-up. The microbiology tests include, besides classic bacterial cultures, urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. A simple prognostic score has been developed to help the physician to decide if the patient needs hospitalization.

As the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as "global pandemic," it is important for everyone, including nuclear medicine personnel, to know how to stop transmission, contain, and prevent the spread of COVID-19. We reach out to our ACNM (American College of Nuclear Medicine) international members from Wuhan, China and Singapore, who have participated in dealing with COVID-19 for the last 2 months, to learn from their lessons and experiences, so to provide advice to all ACNM members for their clinical practice and management strategies in responding to COVID-19.

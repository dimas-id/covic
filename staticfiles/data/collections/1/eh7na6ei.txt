BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Tandem steno-occlusive lesions were poorly represented in randomized trials and represent a major challenge for endovascular thrombectomy in acute anterior circulation strokes. The impact of the cervical carotid lesion cause (ie, atherosclerotic versus dissection) on outcome of tandem patients endovascularly treated remains to be assessed. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed individual data of prospectively collected consecutive tandem patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy. The primary outcome was favorable outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2). Secondary efficacy outcomes included successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction scores of 2b-3), time to reperfusion, and safety outcomes encompassed procedural complications, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality. RESULTS Among the 295 included patients, 65 had cervical carotid dissection and 230 had cervical carotid atherosclerotic cause. The rate of favorable outcome was 56.3% in the dissection group versus 47.6% in the atherosclerotic arm (center-, age-, and admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale-adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-2.30; P=0.85). No significant differences were observed in secondary outcomes. The rates of successful reperfusion, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 90-day mortality were 78.5% versus 74.5% (P=0.13), 4.6% versus 5.2% (P=1.0), and 7.8% versus 15.3% (P=0.94) in the dissection versus atherosclerotic groups, respectively. The median procedural time was 76 minutes (interquartile range, 52-95 minutes) in the dissection group and 67 minutes (interquartile range, 45-98 minutes) in the atherosclerotic group (P=0.24). CONCLUSIONS We found no differences in the outcomes of patients with anterior circulation tandem atherosclerotic and dissection lesions treated with endovascular thrombectomy. Further studies are warranted.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Intraprocedural thrombosis poses a formidable challenge during neuroendovascular procedures because the risks of aggressive thromboembolic treatment must be balanced against the risk of postprocedural hemorrhage. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of ischemic stroke after intraprocedural thrombosis after stent-assisted coiling and pipeline embolization device placement. METHODS A retrospective analysis of intracranial aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling or pipeline embolization device placement between 2007 and 2016 at 4 major academic institutions was performed to identify procedures that were complicated by intraprocedural thrombosis. RESULTS Intraprocedural thrombosis occurred in 34 (4.6%) procedures. Postprocedural ischemic stroke and hemorrhage occurred in 20.6% (7/34) and 11.8% (4/34) of procedures complicated by intraprocedural thrombosis, respectively. Current smoking was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of ischemic stroke or postprocedural hemorrhage with the use of abciximab compared with the use of eptifibatide in treatment of intraprocedural thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Current protocols for treatment of intraprocedural thrombosis associated with placement of intra-arterial devices were effective in preventing ischemic stroke in â‰ˆ80% of cases. Current smoking was the only independent predictor of ischemic stroke.

Abstract Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract disease and bronchiolitis in children, as well as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly and immunocompromised individuals. However, there is no safe and efficacious RSV vaccine or antiviral treatment. Toll Like Receptors (TLR) are important molecular mediators linking innate and adaptive immunity, and their stimulation by cognate agonists has been explored as antiviral agents. Imiquimod is known as a TLR7 agonist, but additionally acts as an antagonist for adenosine receptors. In this study, we demonstrate that imiquimod, but not resiquimod, has direct anti-RSV activity via PKA pathway in HEp-2 and A549 cells, independently of an innate response. Imiquimod restricts RSV infection after viral entry into the host cell, interfering with viral RNA and protein synthesis. Probably as a consequence of these anti-RSV properties, imiquimod displays cytokine modulating activity in RSV infected epithelial cells. Moreover, in a murine model of RSV infection, imiquimod treatment improves the course of acute disease, evidenced by decreased weight loss, reduced RSV lung titers, and attenuated airway inflammation. Consequently, imiquimod represents a promising therapeutic alternative against RSV infection and may inform the development of novel therapeutic targets to control RSV pathogenesis.

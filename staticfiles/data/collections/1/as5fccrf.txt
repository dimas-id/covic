BACKGROUND To assess the impact of volumetry of perinephric fat (PNF) on the perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). METHODS Between 2016 and 2019, a single surgeon performed RAPN for 128 patients with clinical T1a-b renal tumors at our institution, and the 70 most recent patients were included in this study to minimize the effects of surgical experience. PNF was defined as a fatty area around the kidney within the anatomical structures, including the lateroconal fascia, fusion fascia, psoas muscle, lumbar quadrate muscle and diaphragm, and its volume was calculated based on reconstructed three-dimensional computed tomography images using the SYNAPSE VINCENT system. RESULTS In this series, the trifecta and MIC (margin, ischemia and complications) score system outcomes were achieved in 69 (98.6%) and 64 patients (91.4%), respectively. The median PNF volume in the 70 patients was 166.05 cm3, which was significantly correlated with both the body mass index (BMI) and Mayo adhesive probability (MAP) score (correlation coefficient = 0.68 and 0.74, respectively). There was no significant difference in the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, PNF volume or console time during RAPN among 5 groups consisting of 14 consecutive patients. Of several factors examined, the console time was significantly affected by the sex, MAP score and PNF volume, and only the PNF volume was independently associated with the console time. CONCLUSION Even if performed by an experienced robotic surgeon beyond the initial learning curve, the PNF volume may influence the console time during RAPN.

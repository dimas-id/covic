We introduce a weighted propositional configuration logic over a product valuation monoid. Our logic is intended to serve as a specification language for software architectures with quantitative features such as the average of all interactionsâ€™ costs of the architecture and the maximum cost among all costs occurring most frequently within a specific number of components in an architecture. We provide formulas of our logic which describe well-known architectures equipped with quantitative characteristics. Moreover, we prove an efficient construction of a full normal form which leads to decidability of equivalence of formulas in this logic.

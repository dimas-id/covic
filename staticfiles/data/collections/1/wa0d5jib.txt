KEY MESSAGE: Transcriptomic analysis of the relationship between gene expression patterns and flavonoid contents in the flower buds of Lonicera japonica under light-induced conditions, especially the flavonoid pathway genes and transcription factors. ABSTRACT: Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (FLJ), the flower buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb., has been used to treat some human diseases including severe respiratory syndromes and hand-foot-and-mouth diseases owing to its putative antibacterial, and antiviral effects. Luteoloside is a flavonoid that is used by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia to evaluate the quality of FLJ. Light is an important environmental factor that affects flavonoid biosynthesis in the flower buds of L. japonica. However, how light triggers increases in flavonoid production remains unclear. To enhance our understanding of the mechanism involved in light-regulated flavonoid biosynthesis, we sequenced the transcriptomes of L. japonica exposed to three different light conditions: 100% light intensity (CK), 50% light intensity (LI50), and 25% light intensity (LI25) using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 System. A total of 77,297 unigenes with an average length of 809 bp were obtained. Among them, 43,334 unigenes (56.06%) could be matched to at least one biomolecular database. Additionally, 4188, 1545 and 1023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparative transcriptomics LI25-vs-CK, LI50-vs-CK, and LI25-vs-LI50, respectively. Of note, genes known to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, such as 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4CL), and chalcone synthase (CHS) were up-regulated. In addition, a total of 1649 transcription factors (TFs) were identified and divided into 58 TF families; 98 TFs exhibited highly dynamic changes in response to light intensity. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression profiles of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. This study offers insight into how transcriptional expression pattern is influenced by light in the flower buds of L. japonica, and will enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis in response to light in L. japonica.

Disease is still regarded as a major constraint to aquaculture production globally. Rapid disease diagnosis and vaccination play a huge part in the control of bacterial diseases, and there has been significant progress in both of these areas. This chapter considers the limitations of existing methods and reviews recent advances made in pathogen detection technologies and vaccine development methodologies. Future directions are discussed, including nanotechnology and reversed vaccinology.

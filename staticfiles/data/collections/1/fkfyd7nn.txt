AIM Analysis of the nature and time course of early complications after laparoscopic colonic surgery is required to allow rational strategies for their prevention and management. METHOD One hundred and four consecutive patients who underwent elective fast-track laparoscopic colonic cancer surgery were analysed prospectively from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Database, supplemented by data from the medical records. We studied in detail the time course of morbidity and reasons for prolonged stay (> 3 days). RESULTS Seventeen (16.3%) patients had one or more complications. Surgical complications occurred in 14 patients, of which four were preceded by medical complications. Three patients had only medical complications. Median length of stay was 3 days (range 1-44). CONCLUSION Further improvement of outcomes after fast-track laparoscopic colonic surgery might be obtained by improved surgical performance.

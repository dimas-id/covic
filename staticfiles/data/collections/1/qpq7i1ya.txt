The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, which started in the year 2015, is considered the fastest and most widely spread outbreak reported for this flavivirus. The polymerase domain of the NS5 protein has been targeted in other viral infections and is recognized as a suitable target in ZIKV infection. Different novel modified compounds against ZIKV NS5 have been tested in silico. A few structures have been solved for ZIKV polymerase and deposited in the protein data bank website. Two of these solved structures (with a resolution of less than 1.9 A) are used in this study to test the binding of 74 novel compounds in silico. Molecular docking is used to quantify the binding affinities of ZIKV polymerase and compare it to the hepatitis C virus NS5B. A total of 19 novel compounds revealed results that are either similar to or better than the physiological molecule, guanosine triphosphate. Water molecules are found to facilitate the binding of the compounds to ZIKV RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) structures. The presented 19 novel compounds represent good binders to ZIKV RdRp and could be suitable candidates for developing a new and effective anti‐ZIKV polymerase nucleotide inhibitor.

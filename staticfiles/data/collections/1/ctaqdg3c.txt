Intravenous (IV) drug administration, especially with 'smart pumps', is complex and susceptible to errors. Although errors can occur at any stage of the IV medication process, most errors occur during reconstitution and administration. Dose-error reduction software (DERS) loaded on to infusion pumps incorporates a drug library with predefined upper and lower drug dose limits and infusion rates, which can reduce IV infusion errors. Although this is an important advance for patient safety at the point of care, uptake is still relatively low. This article discuses the challenges and benefits of implementing DERS in clinical practice as experienced by three UK trusts.

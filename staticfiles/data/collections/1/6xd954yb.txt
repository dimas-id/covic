Molecular analysis of the N genes of feline coronaviruses (FCoV) strains detected in naturally infected cats were carried out to investigate the genetic diversity among these viruses. Phylogeny showed a general clustering trend on the basis of geographic origin rather than on virulence characteristics. The analysis of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions disclosed "hot spots" sites which may represent immunological domains. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the N gene does not carry mutations associated with the pathotypical switch FECV --> FIPV. During persistent infection, the individual qualitative immune response might address the accumulations of mutations in the N gene and the development of FIP.

BACKGROUND Dietary supplement is an attempt to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in high-risk population. A new mixed vitamin E-Tocovid that mainly contains tocotrienols other than tocopherol, attenuated the progression of white matter lesions by oral in humans. However, the effect of Tocovid on ischemic stroke has not been examined. In the present study, we assessed the therapeutic effects of Tocovid pretreatment on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS After pretreatment with Tocovid (200 mg/kg/d) or vehicle for 1 month, 60-minute tMCAO was performed, and these mice were examined at 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after reperfusion. We histologically assessed the effects of Tocovid pretreatment on the expressive changes of oxidative stress markers, cleaved caspase-3, and LC3-II after tMCAO in mice. RESULTS We observed that Tocovid pretreatment significantly improved the rotarod time, reduced infarct volume, decreased the number of 4-HNE, nitrotyrosine, and 8-OhdG positive cells, inhibited advanced glycation end products biomarkers RAGE, CMA, and CML expressions, and increased Nrf2 and MRP1 levels with GSSG/GSH ratio decrease. Furthermore, Tocovid pretreatment greatly decreased cleaved caspase-3 and LC3-II expressions after tMCAO. CONCLUSIONS The present study obviously demonstrated that Tocovid pretreatment showed neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress and at least in part by antiapoptotic/autophagic cell death in ischemic mice brain.

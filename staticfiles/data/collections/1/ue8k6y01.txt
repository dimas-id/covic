Background and Objectives An aberrant left hepatic artery (ALHA) limits the already confined operative field of laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) and laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair (LHHR). The aim of this study is to provide a safe laparoendoscopic technique for hiatal hernia repair in the presence of an ALHA. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent LARS or LHHR between March 2016 and March 2018. We reviewed clinical and laboratory data and operative reports and images. Follow-up data included gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) questionnaire results and the results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and upper gastrointestinal studies. Results One hundred thirty-one LARS and LHHR procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Eight (6.1%) patients had an ALHA. There were 6 female and 2 male patients. The average age was 54.5 (±10.4) years, and the average body mass index was 28.1 (±5.5) kg/m2. The duration of their GERD symptoms was 16.6 (±6.9) years. Patients underwent LHHR followed by transoral incisionless fundoplication. Hiatoplasty was performed with extracorporeal sliding arthroscopic knots. The ALHA was preserved in all cases. There was no intraoperative bleeding, mortality or postoperative complications. All antireflux medications were discontinued with significant improvement of GERD questionnaires. All patients had EGD at 3 months postoperatively with no recurrence of hiatal hernia. Five patients who had the surgery longer than 1 year ago had an upper gastrointestinal study without evidence of hiatal hernia recurrence. Conclusion The laparoendoscopic technique of hiatal hernia repair, using extracorporeal arthroscopic sliding knots and concomitant transoral incisionless fundoplication, is safe, preserves an ALHA, and allows proper surgical techniques in a confined operative field.

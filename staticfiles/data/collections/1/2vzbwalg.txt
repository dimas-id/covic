Continuous cell lines have become indispensable tools that have enabled investigations into cellular mechanisms by increasing experimental reproducibility and sample availability, and decreasing the use of experimental animals. To facilitate studies of epithelial barrier function of the porcine colon, we aimed to establish an epithelial cell line with an extended replicative capacity. Cells were isolated from the proximal colon of a 3-week-old piglet and transduced using a recombinant retroviral vector construct containing the simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 TAg). We established a clonal epithelial cell line, referred to as PoCo83-3, that stably expressed the SV40 TAg, verified at mRNA and protein levels. PoCo83-3 showed epithelial cell-specific features, such as cobblestone-like morphology, dome structure formation, the presence of apical microvilli, and the expression of keratin 18, E-cadherin and the tight junction-associated proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1. To validate PoCo83-3 as an in vitro model in epithelial barrier research, proinflammatory cytokine-inducible alterations in barrier integrity were demonstrated by incubating the cells with TNF-α and IFN-γ for 48 h. These cytokine treatments promoted a decreased transepithelial electrical resistance. In summary, PoCo83-3 exhibited an extended life span and a differentiated phenotype while maintaining epithelial characteristics. Based on these results, we present this cell line as a valuable in vitro model for investigations of epithelial barrier function in the porcine colon.

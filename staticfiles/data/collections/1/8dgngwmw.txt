SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a world public health threat. Herein, we report that the clinical approved auranofin could perfectly inhibit the activity of 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Gold cluster could significantly inhibit 3CLpro of SARS-COV-2. Phenyl isothiocyanate and Vitamin K3 could well suppress the activity of 3CLpro. For Mpro inhibition, IC50 of auranofin, Vitamin K3, phenyl isothiocyanate, gold cluster are about 0.51μM, 7.96μM, 10.13μM, 1.61μM, respectively. These compounds may be with potentials for treatment SARS-CoV-2 virus replication. Especially for FDA approved auranofin, it is an anti-inflammation drug in clinic, thus it may with strong potential to inhibit virus replication and suppress the inflammation damage in COVID-19 patients. Gold cluster is with better safety index and well anti-inflammation in vitro/vivo, therefore it is with potential to inhibit virus replication and suppress the inflammation damage caused by COVID-19 virus. As Au(I) ion is active metabolism specie derived from gold compounds or gold clusters in vivo, further computational studies revealed Au ion could tightly bind thiol group of Cys145 residue of 3CLpro thus inhibit enzyme activity. Also, phenyl isothiocyanate and Vitamin K3 may interact with thiol group of Cys145 via Michael addition reaction, molecular dynamic (MD) theory studied are applied to confirmed these small molecules are stable in the pocket and inhibit Mpro activity.

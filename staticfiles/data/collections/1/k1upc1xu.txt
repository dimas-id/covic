Contact recommendation is an important functionality in many social network scenarios including Twitter and Facebook, since they can help grow the social networks of users by suggesting, to a given user, people they might wish to follow. Recently, it has been shown that classical information retrieval (IR) weighting models – such as BM25 – can be adapted to effectively recommend new social contacts to a given user. However, the exact properties that make such adapted contact recommendation models effective at the task are as yet unknown. In this paper, inspired by new advances in the axiomatic theory of IR, we study the existing IR axioms for the contact recommendation task. Our theoretical analysis and empirical findings show that while the classical axioms related to term frequencies and term discrimination seem to have a positive impact on the recommendation effectiveness, those related to length normalization tend to be not desirable for the task.

The diagnosis of intracranial arterial dissection (IAD) may be challenging and multimodal imaging techniques are often needed to confirm the diagnosis. Previous studies have based their criteria for diagnosis of IAD on conventional angiography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. We report a case with acute ischemic stroke due to spontaneous basilar artery dissection in which intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to show features of IAD. A 59-years-old woman presented with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. Thrombosis related to basilar artery (BA) stenosis was assumed on conventional angiography; however, no clot was retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and a restored BA caliber was observed after a rescue recanalization with the detachment of a self-expanding stent was performed. Spontaneous IAD was suspected; however, angiographic findings were ambiguous for confirming IAD. The patient remained symptom-free until 18-months follow-up. At this point, angiography showed restenosis at the proximal tapered length of the stent. In vivo OCT was performed to assess the pathological changes of the restenosis and confirm the diagnosis of IAD.OCT revealed BA dissection with the presence of remnant transverse flap, double lumen and mural hematoma. Imaging at multiple levels identified intimal disruption that originated in the right vertebral artery and extended distally to the BA. The use of intravascular imaging with OCT enabled the accurate diagnosis of IAD. Care should be taken as the procedure may add additional risks to the patient. Future studies are needed to validate the safety of OCT in IAD.

Obesity can be considered to be one of the most important chronic diseases facing Canadians of all ages. Whereas patients with a very high body mass index may have the most to gain from procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch, the increased risk of postoperative complications often makes them poor surgical candidates. As a result, several "bridging" procedures have been proposed to impart clinically effective weight loss and reduce the risk of complications and improve outcomes in the definitive weight-loss procedure. In this article, we provide a review of the evidence in support of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy as an innovative new surgical procedure used as a bridging procedure in patients with severe obesity and discuss new findings for its possible role as a definitive procedure for some individuals with less severe obesity. Finally, we comment on a possible approach to introduce this innovative new procedure to Canadian bariatric centres.

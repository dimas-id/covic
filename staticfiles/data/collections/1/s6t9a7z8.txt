Smart cities emerge as highly sophisticated bionetworks, providing smart services and ground-breaking solutions. This paper relates classification with Smart City projects, particularly focusing on traffic prediction. A systematic literature review identifies the main topics and methods used, emphasizing on various Smart Cities components, such as data harvesting and data mining. It addresses the research question whether we can forecast traffic load based on past data, as well as meteorological conditions. Results have shown that various models can be developed based on weather data with varying level of success.

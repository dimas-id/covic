Here we present results from a survey on anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthy blood donors from a low incidence COVID-19 area (Apulia region, South Eastern Italy). Among 904 subjects tested, only in 9 cases (0.99%) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were demonstrated. All the 9 seropositive patients were negative for the research of viral RNA by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swab. These data, along with those recently reported from other countries, clearly show that we are very far from herd immunity and that the containment measures are at the moment the only realistic instrument we have to slow the spread of the pandemic.

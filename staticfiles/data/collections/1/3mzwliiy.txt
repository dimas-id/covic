Surfactant replacement therapy is a major breakthrough in neonatal medicine. Prophylaxis or treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with various surfactant preparations is now a clinical reality. With either strategy the incidence of air leaks and mortality is reduced; more babies with RDS survive without signs of chronic lung disease. The earlier the treatment, the better the outcome. An initial dose of 100 mg/kg can be recommended for all natural preparations, and some babies may benefit from multiple dose treatment. Meta-analyses show a consistent advantage of natural surfactant preparations over the currently available synthetic ones. There is growing evidence that surfactant may also be beneficial in pulmonary diseases of the newborn which are characterized by inactivation of the surfactant system such as meconium aspiration syndrome or neonatal pneumonia.

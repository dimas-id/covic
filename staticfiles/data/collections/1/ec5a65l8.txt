The article provides a review of foreign literature for 2020 on existing methods of drug treatment of coronavirus disease COVID-19. To date, in the treatment of COVID-19 in different countries, a little more than 10 drugs are used. The largest number of studies on the testing of these drugs is carried out by scientists from China, the USA, and European countries. It should be noted that among these drugs there is not a single new drug developed specifically for the treatment of COVID-19, the recommended and used drugs have previously been used to treat, as a rule, diseases of the viral etiology, less often another pathology. These suggestions are often based on analogy, the hypothesis of their supposed effectiveness for COVID-19. It can be assumed that a brake on the development of a drug specific for coronavirus disease is a poor knowledge of the pathogenesis of virus invasion in the body's adhesives and the development of complications. The review provides detailed literature data on drugs such as hydroxychloroquine / chloroquine, lopinavir/natinavir, remdesivir, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin converting enzyme receptor blockers, tissue plasminogen activator, as well as plasma transfusion transfusions.

A new viral disease named COVID-19 has recently turned into a pandemic. Compared to a common viral pneumonia it may evolve in an atypical way, causing the rapid death of the patient. For over two centuries, autopsy has been recognized as a fundamental diagnostic technique, particularly for new or little-known diseases. To date, it is often considered obsolete giving the inadequacy to provide samples of a quality appropriate to the sophisticated diagnostic techniques available today. This is probably one of the reasons why during this pandemic autopsies were often requested only in few cases, late and discouraged, if not prohibited, by more than one nation. This is in contrast with our firm conviction: to understand the unknown we must look at it directly and with our own eyes. This has led us to implement an autopsy procedure that allows the beginning of the autopsy shortly after death (within 1-2 h) and its rapid execution, also including sampling for ultrastructural and molecular investigations. In our experience, the tissue sample collected for diagnosis and research were of quality similar to biopsy or surgical resections. This procedure was performed ensuring staff and environmental safety. We want to propose our experience, our main qualitative results and a few general considerations, hoping that they can be an incentive to use autopsy with a new procedure adjusted to match the diagnostic challenges of the third millennium.

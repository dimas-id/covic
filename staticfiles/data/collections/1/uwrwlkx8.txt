Abstract In captivity, gastrointestinal diseases are the most common clinical finding in common marmosets. Clinical signs may be due to a host of etiologies and typically manifest as weight loss, diarrhea, changes in eating habits, and/or abdominal distension. Proper recognition of clinical signs and identification of the underlying cause(s) is important to maintain the health of the individual animal and colony as a whole.

PURPOSE Laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anastomosis with double stapling technique is difficult because of unsuitable cutting angle in narrow pelvic cavity. For reasons of tilted and long linear staple line of rectal stump, circular anastomotic plane can make multiple intersections. The present study was designed to assess whether multiple intersections after double stapling technique is the risk factor of anastomotic complication in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 128 consecutive left colon and rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic rectal resection with double stapling technique were enrolled in this study. In all cases, operator tried to reduce intersections by inversion and invagination techniques. They were subdivided into 3 groups: 58 patients with no intersection of staple lines (group A), 62 patients with 1 point of intersection (group B) and 8 patients with 2 points of intersection (group C). Intraoperative air leakage, incomplete cut ring, postoperative bleeding, anastomotic stenosis, and leakage were compared between the 3 groups. RESULTS Clinical anastomotic leakage was identified in 1 (group C) of 128 patients (0.7%). Overall anastomotic leakage rate was 0% (0/58) in group A, 0% (0/62) in group B, and 12.5% (1/8) in group C (P=0.001). In univariate analysis, intersections of staple lines were associated with anastomotic complications. There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The number of intersections of staple lines is associated with anastomotic leakage, and the inversion technique is a useful method for avoiding anastomotic leakage. Using an appropriate technique by skilled operator, double stapling technique for laparoscopic anterior resection is safe and feasible.

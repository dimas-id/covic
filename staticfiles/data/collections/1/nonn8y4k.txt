OBJECTIVE To assess factors associated with changes in blood pressure during early mobilization protocol for patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. METHOD We analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT group, n=60) and patients who received conservative medical management (control group, n=60) matched by age and National Institute Health of Stroke Score at admission from April 2009 to July 2014. The proportion of patients with prominent blood pressure change during an early mobilization protocol was compared between the MT group and control group. Factors associated with prominent blood pressure change were also analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULT The deviation in blood pressure response was much more significant in the MT than control group (13.3 vs. 1.7%, p<0.016). Logistic regression analysis showed the interval from admission to being able to sit in a wheelchair associated with prominent changes in blood pressure (odds ratio, 1.604; 95% confidence interval, 1.196-2.150; p<0.002). CONCLUSION Our results showed that prominent changes in blood pressure during an early mobilization protocol can occur easily in patients with acute ischemic stroke after mechanical thrombectomy.

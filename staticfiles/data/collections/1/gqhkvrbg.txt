Background: Urachal cysts (UCs) are secondary to incomplete obliteration of the embryonic urachal duct and may become symptomatic when infected. Treatment is primarily surgical to excise the infected cyst. Surgical approaches include a lower midline laparotomy or minimally invasive (MI) techniques. Case: We present a case of a young male with an infected UC that was treated with a single-incision laparoscopy surgery. The operative technique is described. Conclusion: This approach is a safe and feasible option for the MI management of UCs.

Cytofluorometric analysis was performed to characterize the immunophenotype of lymphocytes of the synovial fluid (SF) and the peripheral blood (PB) from patients suffering from juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The most obvious difference could be found in expression of the surface protease aminopeptidase N (AP N/CD13). Whereas monoclonal antibodies specific to CD13 failed to reveal surface expression on lymphocytes of the PB; 63 Â± 15% of SF T cells gave positive staining for CD 13 using Leu-M7. No correlation between CD13 expression and joint disease could be found in patients who had different types of inflammatory joint effusions. CD13 expression of T cells was also found in synovial tissue and inflammatory serous cavity effusions. Fixation of T cells revealed the presence of intracellular CD13 antigen already located in the PB T cells of healthy individuals. Induction of CD13 expression on PB T cells could be demonstrated after incubation with Con A/IL-2 or SF from patients with RA. Our findings suggest a role for AP N as a new activation-associated molecule of T lymphocytes.

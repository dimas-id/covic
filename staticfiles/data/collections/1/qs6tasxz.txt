Upper respiratory viruses cause self-limited illness characterized by acute rhinitis. In rhinovirus colds the symptoms are thought to be caused by the host response rather than viral damage of the nasal epithelium. Rhinovirus triggers an inflammatory cascade, evidenced by the presence of inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-8) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., kinins) in nasal secretions, which results in symptomatic illness. In contrast to rhinovirus and coronavirus, which do not cause discernible epithelial damage, influenza virus and adenovirus do damage the nasal epithelium. Appropriate antiviral therapy will depend on the causative virus. Treatment of rhinovirus colds may require an antiviral agent (e.g., interferon alpha) in combination with antiinflammatory medication.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression differences in maturation and cytokine production of dendritic cells (DCs) from sepsis patients and the effect of oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OXPAPC) on DCs phenotypes. METHODS Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 50 sepsis patients and 50 controls were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNF-α to induce DCs maturation. DCs from sepsis patients were also treated with three different concentrations of OXPAPC. Cells were characterized with optical and electron microscopy, FACS analysis for CD1α, HLA-DR and CD86 on cell surface and ELISA analysis of IL-12p70 in the supernatant. RESULTS DCs from sepsis patients had smaller cell bodies and nucleus and had almost no surface projection. DCs had similar CD1α expression in sepsis patients (86.37 ± 17.24) and controls (88.58 ± 10.05). HLA-DR expression was dramatically reduced in sepsis patients (2.74 ± 5.15) compared to controls (198.35 ± 12.04). Similarly, CD86 expression was also drastically lower in sepsis patients (14.72 ± 4.83) than controls (154.56 ± 11.56). Furthermore, OXPAPC treatment of DCs from sepsis patients increased cell surface projection, HLA-DR and CD86 surface expression and IL-12p70 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. With 40 μg/ml of OXPAPC, DCs of sepsis patients have similar phenotypes observed in healthy controls. CONCLUSION DCs from sepsis patients are defective in maturation and cytokine secretion and these defects can be corrected by OXPAPC treatment.

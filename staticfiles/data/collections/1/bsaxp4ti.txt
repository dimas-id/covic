Recently, an epidemic disease outbreak caused by a novel human coronavirus has surged worldwide. Our aim is to briefly describe the potential help of phytotherapy research in finding new integrative therapeutic options against human coronaviruses, and to provide researchers with some essential hints to be used for planning future studies. Existing evidence mostly derives from laboratory studies, whereas clinical data have been only collected for multi-component formulations used in Traditional Chinese Medicine in addition to standard care. Herbs with anti-viral properties like Glycyrrhiza glabra, Scutellaria baicalensis, Sambucus nigra, Pelargonium sidoides, or Cistus incanus, as well as herbal remedies with immune boosting effects like Astragalus membranaceus or Echinacea purpurea may all appear interesting options to study.

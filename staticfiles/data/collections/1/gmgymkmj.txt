BACKGROUND Unidirectional, barbed suture allows knotless wound closure with potential value for the progression of advanced suturing techniques. This study compared an absorbable barbed suture device to a monofilament suture in a single-layer enterotomy closure model. METHODS A series of 10 enterotomies were created in the stomach, jejunum, and colon through midline laparotomy in 13 mongrels. The enterotomies were closed in a simple continuous pattern and randomized to either conventional suture secured with three square knots or a barbed suture device without knots. Closure time was recorded for each sample. Adhesion scores and biomechanical wound strengths were assessed at postoperative days 3, 10, and 21 by burst pressure testing. RESULTS Barbed suture provided a faster closure compared to conventional suture (p â‰¤ .02). There was no significant difference in burst pressures or adhesion scores between barbed suture and monofilament suture enterotomy closures at day 3, 10, or 21. CONCLUSION Enterotomy closure was faster using the barbed device as compared to conventional suture, with no significant difference in burst strength or adhesion scores at any time point.

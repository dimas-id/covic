AIM Asphyxiated neonates should be resuscitated with air, but it remains unclear if oxygen supplementation is needed in ineffectively ventilated newborn infants. We studied the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with oxygen or air in an experimental model of inadequate ventilation. METHODS Asphyxia was induced in 16 newborn piglets until their heart rate was <60 bpm or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <30 mmHg. During the first 10 minutes of resuscitation, they received one breath per minute of oxygen (n = 8) or air (n = 8). Tidal volume was 7.5 mL/kg. If MAP was <30 mmHg for 15 seconds, closed-chest cardiac massage (CCCM) was performed for 45 seconds. From 10 minutes onward, all piglets received normal ventilation with air. ROSC was defined as a heart rate >150 bpm, MAP >40 mmHg and no subsequent CCCM. RESULTS Before resuscitation, the median arterial pH was 6.73. At 10 minutes, no piglets in the oxygen group needed CCCM, while all did in the air group (p < 0.001). The median time to ROSC was 60 seconds with oxygen and 845 seconds with air (p < 0.001). No brain tissue hyperoxia occurred. CONCLUSION When ventilation was inadequate, one oxygen breath reduced time to ROSC in piglets with severe metabolic and respiratory acidosis.

Blood loss has always been a sensitive issue in surgery. Traditional techniques, such as suturing and electrocautery, have drastically reduced operatory bleeding. Unfortunately, wound edges and point application devices are frequently characterized by bleeding and infections. Over the past 20 years, haemostatic agents and tissue sealants have been developed and now are currently used, along with classic suture in various surgical specialties. Their fluid nature allows management of blood loss along any point of the wound and tissue repair. This review presents an overview of the most diffused haemostatic sealants, focusing on their main use in surgery and their adverse effects.

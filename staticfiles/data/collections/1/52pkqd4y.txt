Summary An outbreak of a coronavirus infection in a litter of 10-week-old poodle pups from a commercial kennel is described. Coronavirus-like particles were demonstrated by electron microscopy in the intestinal contents and in the colonic mucosa. Treponemas and campylobacters were excreted in great numbers in the faeces. The gastrointestinal disturbances were complicated by hepatic and renal degeneration and severe bronchopneumonia.

BACKGROUND An estimated 4-5 million individuals gather each year in the holy city of Touba, Senegal during the Grand Magal religious pilgrimage. Pilgrims come from across Senegal and the surrounding countries, as well as from countries outside Africa. It is the largest mass gathering (MG) of the Mouride community and the largest Muslim religious MG in West Africa. METHOD A cross-sectional study was conducted on all patients who attended a public healthcare structure during the November 2015 Grand Magal. RESULT Data were collected on a total of 32,229 healthcare contacts. The most frequent reasons for consultation were trauma, followed by fatigue and heatstroke. Infectious diseases were also prevalent with, notably, a high rate of febrile systemic illnesses and malaria, diarrheal diseases, and respiratory tract infections. Such results are likely to be linked to overcrowding and climatic conditions, the relative lack of sanitary facilities, and limited medical resources available during the event. CONCLUSION The context of the Grand Magal MG is unique, given its location in a tropical developing country and its international component which may favor the globalization of locally endemic diseases. As such, it warrants investment in modern methods for public health surveillance and planning of the event.

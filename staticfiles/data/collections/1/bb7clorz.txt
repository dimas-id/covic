The relationship between infection and Kawasaki disease (KD) remains unclear. Infection has long been considered a key predisposing factor for KD. Bacterial and viral agents may be related to the onset of KD because of superantigen and cytokine production. Various bacterial and viral infections have been reported to be associated with KD, but the actual mechanism remains unknown. The higher association between KD and enterovirus has been well documented by using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. However, no evidence has been obtained that various bacterial and viral infections induce KD. Comprehensive research, including infectious agents, should be conducted to elucidate the pathogenesis of KD.

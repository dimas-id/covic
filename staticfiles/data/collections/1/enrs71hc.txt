Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of human skin cancer, which is driven by the aberrant activation of Hedgehog signaling. Previous evidence indicated that sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is associated with the tumor metastasis. However, the expression and role of SOX2 in BCC remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

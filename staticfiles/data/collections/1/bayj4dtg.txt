The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV2), inducing the current pandemic disease (COVID-19) and causing pneumoniae in humans, is dramatically increasing in epidemic scale since its first appearance in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The first infection from epidemic coronaviruses in 2003 fostered the spread of an overwhelming amount of related scientific efforts. The manifold aspects that have been raised, as well as their redundancy offer precious information that has been underexploited and needs to be critically re-evaluated, appropriately used and offered to the whole community, from scientists, to medical doctors, stakeholders and common people. These efforts will favour a holistic view on the comprehension, prevention and development of strategies (pharmacological, clinical etc) as well as common intervention against the new coronavirus spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or to the sex related biases in the affected population. The model highlights novel opportunities for further investigations, diagnosis and appropriate intervention to understand and fight COVID19.

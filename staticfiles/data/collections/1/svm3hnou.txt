Objective To compare outcomes between laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LSPDP) and open spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (OSPDP) for treatment of benign and low-grade malignant tumors of the pancreas and evaluate feasibility and safety of LSPDP. Methods The clinical data of 53 cases of LSPDP and 44 cases of OSPDP performed between January 2008 and August 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical outcomes between the two groups were compared. Results There was no significant difference in preoperative data between the two groups. However, the LSPDP group had statistically significant shorter operative time (145.3±55.9 versus 184.7±33.5, P=0.03) and lesser intraoperative blood loss (150.6±180.8 versus 253.5±76.2, P=0.03) than that of the OSPDP group. Moreover, the LSPDP group also had statistically significant earlier passing of first flatus (2.2±1.4 versus 3.1±1.9, P=0.01), earlier diet intake (2.3±1.8 versus 3.4±2.0, P=0.01), and shorter hospital stay (6.2±7.2 versus 8.8±9.3, 0.04) than that of the OSPDP group. However, postoperative pancreatic fistula (P=0.64) and total postoperative complications (P=0.59) were not significantly different between the groups. The rate of pancreatic fistula and total postoperative complications occurred in 62.5% and 64.5%, respectively, in LSPDP group and, similarly, 70% and 70.0%, respectively, in OSPDP group. Conclusion This study confirms that LSPDP is safe, feasible, and superior to OSPDP in terms of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, and postoperative recovery. Hence, it is worth popularizing LSPDP for benign and low-grade malignant tumors of the pancreas.

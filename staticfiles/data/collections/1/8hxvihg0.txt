Enterprise designers need to continuously re-design their enterprise, re-evaluating the technologies that are available to digitize their operations. Although light-weight agile software development approaches are favored by software development service providers, additional requirements elicitation practices should be incorporated when scaling factors apply, since design team members need to have a shared understanding of the operating context and high-level requirements. Research indicated that the organization construction diagram (OCD) could be useful to create a shared context for enterprise operation, linking detailed functional requirements to this shared context during software development. Although the OCD is concise, its associated concepts are abstract and an additional story-card method (SCM) is needed to transform existing enterprise implementations into an OCD. Since additional evaluation of the SCM was required, this study focused on a real-world demonstration of the SCM at a Fintech company where an agile software development approach is applied. The results indicate that the SCM is useful when incorporated within an agile software development approach.

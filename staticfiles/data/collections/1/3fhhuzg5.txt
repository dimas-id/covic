It has been nearly 50 years since the golden age of antibiotic discovery (1945â€“1975) ended; yet, we still struggle to identify novel drug targets and to deliver new chemical classes of antibiotics to replace those rendered obsolete by drug resistance. Despite herculean efforts utilizing a wide range of antibiotic discovery platform strategies, including genomics, bioinformatics, systems biology and postgenomic approaches, success has been at best incremental. Obviously, finding new classes of antibiotics is really hard, so repeating the old strategies, while expecting different outcomes, seems to boarder on insanity. The key questions dealt with in this review include: (1) If mutation based drug resistance is the major challenge to any new antibiotic, is it possible to find drug targets and new chemical entities that can escape this outcome; (2) Is the number of novel chemical classes of antibacterials limited by the number of broad spectrum drug targets; and (3) If true, then should we focus efforts on subgroups of pathogens like Gram negative or positive bacteria only, anaerobic bacteria or other group where the range of common essential genes is likely greater?. This review also provides some examples of existing drug targets that appear to escape the specter of mutation based drug resistance, and provides examples of some intermediate spectrum strategies as well as modern molecular and genomic approaches likely to improve the odds of delivering 21st century medicines to combat multidrug resistant pathogens.

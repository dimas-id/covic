Background The COVID-19 pandemic is creating significant challenges for healthcare infrastructure for countries of all development and resource levels. Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. Methodology/Principal Findings This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far. Conclusions/Significance This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.

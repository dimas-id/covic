The ongoing global crisis due to Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an enormous socioeconomic burden. A novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) that evolved from a virus infecting bats is responsible for COVID-19, first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In the absence of any specific scientifically proven and clinically tested drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus is wreaking havoc across the world, claiming more than 2,50,000 lives in less than 5 months, and posed a global health emergency. The scientific community is relentlessly working on the design and testing of vaccines and antiviral drugs against the novel coronavirus, several of which have reached advanced stages of testing and are undergoing clinical trials. Here we discuss the recent advances and developments in understanding the etiology and epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic, the factors influencing the disease transmission, and the countermeasures adopted to combat and stop further spread of the disease.

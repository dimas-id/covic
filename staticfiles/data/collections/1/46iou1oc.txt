The annular pancreas in adults is a rare congenital anomaly that is detected after development of complications, such as gastric outlet obstruction, recurrent pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer. Duodenal bypass is the procedure of choice for treating duodenal obstruction caused by the annular pancreas in both children and adults. Duodenoduodenostomy is routinely performed in neonates and children. In adults, duodenojejunostomy or gastrojejunostomy are recommended, because the duodenum is less mobile. We report a case of annular pancreas in a 33-year-old male that was successfully treated with laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy.

Life on this planet is dependent on water but our health is greatly impacted by the quality of that water. The global water crisis is clear, one only needs to quote the statistics on the billions of people without access to safe water, sanitation and the global estimates of the burden of waterborne disease. The greatest sources of biological contaminants associated with this disease burden in water remains human and animal feces. There is a critical need to develop a science-based program to address both water quantity and quality of water, water uses and discharges. Recommendations to achieve better access to scientific information for decision making include: 1) develop watershed approaches for determining the source and the behaviour of water-borne biological contaminants which can be used within Water Safety Plans, 2) utilize new tools and technologies for measuring the hazards and the exposure within a risk assessment framework and 3) develop a global data base and goals for biological contaminant loading for achieving safe water.

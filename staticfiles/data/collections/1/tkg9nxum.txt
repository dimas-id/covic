The process of protein post-translational modifications (PTM) is one of the critical mechanisms of regulation of many cellular processes, which makes it an attractive target for various viruses. Since viruses cannot replicate on their own, they have developed unique abilities to alter metabolic and signaling cell pathways, including protein PTMs, to ensure faithful replication of their genomes. This review describes several ways of how lysine-specific PTMs are used by various viruses to ensure its successful invasion and replication. Covalent modifications like acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation form a complex system of reversible and often competing modifications, which adds an additional level of complexity to the system of regulation of the activity of host proteins involved in viral replication and propagation. In furthering these, we also describe the manner in which PTM pathways can also be accosted by various types of viruses to neutralize the host's cellular mechanisms for anti-viral protection and highlight key areas for future therapeutic targeting and design.

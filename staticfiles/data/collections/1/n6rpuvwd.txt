The lungs are the only transplanted organ in direct contact with the ‘outside world’. Infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplantation. Early accurate diagnosis and optimal management is essential to prevent short and long term complications. Bacteria, including Mycobacteria and Nocardia, viruses and fungi are common pathogens. Organisms may be present in the recipient prior to transplantation, transmitted with the donor lungs or acquired after transplantation. The degree of immunosuppression and the routine use of antimicrobial prophylaxis alters the pattern of post-transplant infections.

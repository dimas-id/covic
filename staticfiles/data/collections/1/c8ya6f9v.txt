There is debate about the extent to which COVID-19 affects ethnic groups differently. We explored if there was variation in hospital mortality in patients with COVID. Mortality rates in 1,276 inpatients in Bradford with test results for COVID-19 were analysed by ethnic group. The age-adjusted risk of dying from COVID-19 was slightly lower in South Asian compared to White British patients. (RR =0.87, 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.84).

We prospectively collected clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data regarding community-acquired human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection in consecutive adults hospitalized with pneumonia. hMPV infection was diagnosed using highly accurate reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal samples. Eight (4%) of 193 patients had hMPV RNA present, all detected during influenza season. hMPV is an important cause of pneumonia in adults.

We have analyzed the cell-type-specific expression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components across 141 cell types or subtypes as defined by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. ACE2, one of the components of RAS, also facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in cooperation with its associated protease TMPRSS2. Therefore, our analysis also contributes to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection, spreading of the virus throughout the body, and potential viral interference with RAS in COVID-19 patients.

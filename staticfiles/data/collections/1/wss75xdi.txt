Human parechoviruses (HPeV) are mainly isolated from upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis in children. HPeV has not been screened for in the past studies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults, and its association with CAP is unknown. We present two cases that HPeV was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and diagnosed as pneumonia caused by HPeV.

Using a novel recruitment method to reduce selection bias with paired molecular and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we determined point prevalence in a racially diverse municipality. Infections were highly variable by ZIP and differed by race. Overall census-weighted prevalence was 7.8% and the calculated infection fatality rate was 1.63%.

OBJECTIVE Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-(MERS-CoV) infection is an evolving worldwide health crisis. The early diagnosis and management of the disease remains a major challenge. This study designed to discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical appearances of MERS-CoV infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a broad search of the English-language literature in "PubMed" "Medline" "Web of knowledge", "EMBASE" and "Google Scholar" World Health Organization-WHO" using the key words "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome", "MERS", "MERS-CoV" "Epidemiology" "Transmission" "Pathogenesis" "Clinical Characteristics". We reviewed the literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical appearances of MERS-CoV infection and the required information was documented. RESULTS The global prevalence of MERS-CoV infection from June 2012 to April 2018 is 2206 people. The number of cases reported from Saudi Arabia is 1831 (83%) with mortality rate of 787 (35.67%). The main clinical manifestations are fever, chills, generalized myalgia, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The age-allied prevalence of MERS-CoV was highest amongst elderly people with chronic debilitating diseases such as pulmonary diseases, end-stage renal illness, diabetes mellitus and malignancy. CONCLUSIONS MERS-CoV infection is an emerging global health concern, affected people in 27 countries in the various continents. MERS-CoV infection has been identified mainly in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and North America. Early detection and management of MERS-CoV infection is of critical importance to minimize the burden of the disease.

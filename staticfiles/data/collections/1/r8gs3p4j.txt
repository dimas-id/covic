Retroviral vectors utilize the biochemical processes unique to retroviruses, to transfer genes with high efficiency into a wide variety of cell types in tissue culture and in living animals. With such vectors, the effect of newly introduced genes and the mechanism of gene expression can be studied in cell types so far refractory to other methods of transfer.

We report three cases of severe thrombocytopenia during COVID-19 infection associated with either cutaneous purpura or mucosal bleeding. The initial investigations ruled out other causes of thrombocytopenia. Two of the patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and eltrombopag, while the third recovered spontaneously. A good clinical and biological response was achieved in all patients leading to hospital discharge. LEARNING POINTS: Immune thrombocytopenia should be considered in COVID-19-infected patients presenting with thrombocytopenia. Coronavirus-related thrombocytopenia can be severe and life-threatening. Despite the severity of coronavirus-related immune thrombocytopenia, recovery may be spontaneous or achieved following immunoglobulin or platelet growth factor administration.

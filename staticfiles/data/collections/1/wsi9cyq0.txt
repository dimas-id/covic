Abstract Background The 2019 Coronavirus pandemic has drastically disrupted the delivery of Neurosurgical care, especially for the already at-risk neuro-oncology population. The sudden change to clinic visits has rapidly spurned the implementation of telemedicine. A recommendation care paradigm of neuro-oncologic patients limited by telemedicine has not been reported. Methods A summary of a multi-institution experience detailing the potential benefits, pitfalls and the necessary considerations to outpatient care of neurosurgical oncology patients. Results There are limitations and advantages to incorporating telemedicine into the outpatient care of neuro-oncology patients. Telemedicine-specific considerations for each step and stakeholder of the appointment (physician, patient, scheduling, pre-visit, imaging, and physical examination) are examined. Conclusions Telemedicine, pushed to prominence during this COVID-19 pandemic, is a powerful and possibly preferential tool for the future of outpatient neuro-oncologic care.

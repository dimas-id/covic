BACKGROUND Aneurysms involving the lenticulostriate artery (LSA) are rare. The majority of LSA aneurysms reported are idiopathic. We present 2 paediatric cases of dissecting distal LSA aneurysm. An 8-year-old girl and 9-year-old boy presented with basal ganglia infarction. History and imaging identified dissection as the most likely aetiology. The clinico-radiological features, aetiology and management involving are discussed. Conservative treatment with careful clinico-radiological monitoring may be a feasible therapeutic strategy.

Abstract Murine-adapted porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), MK-p10, shows high neurovirulence and increased fusion activity compared with a non-adapted MK strain. MK-p10 S protein had four mutations relative to the original virus S, and one of these (H→R at position 1381, H1381R) in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) was suggested to be responsible for the increased fusion activity. To explore this, we examined fusion activity using recombinant S proteins. We expressed and compared the fusion activity of MK-p10 S, S with the H1381R mutation, S with the three other mutations that were not thought to be involved in high fusion activity, and the original S protein. The MK-p10 and MK-H1381R S proteins induced larger cell fusions than others. We also examined the distribution of these S proteins; the MK-p10 and MK-H1381R S proteins were transported onto the cell surface more efficiently than others. These findings suggest that the H1381R mutation is responsible for enhanced fusion activity, which may be attributed to the efficient transfer of S onto the cell surface. H1381 is a component of the KxHxx motif in the CT region, which is a retrieval signal of the S protein for the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Loss of this motif could allow for the efficient transfer of S proteins from ERGIC onto the cell surface and subsequent increased fusion activity.

Pulmonary sequestration is a rare developmental abnormality where pulmonary tissue lacks normal connections to the tracheobronchial tree, in addition to its having an anomalous systemic blood supply. Lobectomy via open thoracotomy has long been the procedure of choice for the resection of pulmonary sequestration. We present three cases of thoracoscopic lobectomies performed using video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Transection of the associated aberrant artery was performed using only a single staple.

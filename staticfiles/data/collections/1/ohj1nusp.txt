Abstract Viral encephalitis is a global health concern. The ability of a virus to modulate the immune response can have a pivotal effect on the course of disease and the fate of the infected host. In this study, we sought to understand the immunological basis for the fatal encephalitis following infection with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM, in contrast with the more attenuated MHV-A59. Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes. In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFNβ mRNA relative to IFNγ mRNA. This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection. Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFNγ production and antiviral activity. MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of macrophages in the brain on day 7 compared to MHV-A59 infection. These observations indicate that differences in the severity of viral encephalitis may reflect the differential ability of viruses to stimulate innate immune responses within the CNS and subsequently the character of infiltrating leukocyte populations.

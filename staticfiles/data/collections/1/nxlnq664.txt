The purpose of this study was to describe Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection of three cats in Poland showing signs of fever, swollen and painful joints, pale mucous membranes and epistaxis. Morulae consistent with A phagocytophilum were present within the neutrophils of two of the cats. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was found targeting the 16S rRNA gene amplified DNA consistent with A phagocytophilum in the blood of all three cats. The sequence of the PCR product obtained showed 99.6-100% homology with the sequence of A phagocytophilum, gene number EU 090186 from Genbank. Applied therapy (including administration of tetracyclines for 3 weeks) resulted in a gradual clinical recovery.

Systematic review is a type of literature review designed to synthesize all available evidence on a given question. Systematic reviews require significant time and effort, which has led to the continuing development of computer support. This paper seeks to identify the gaps and opportunities for computer support. By interviewing experienced systematic reviewers from diverse fields, we identify the technical problems and challenges reviewers face in conducting a systematic review and their current uses of computer support. We propose potential research directions for how computer support could help to speed the systematic review process while retaining or improving review quality.

INTRODUCTION: Management of acute abdomen during COVID-19 pandemic may be challenging. Presentation of case. A 42-year old man was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. Fever, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia significantly improved over the next 2 weeks, but the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. Computed tomography scan revealed absence of contrast enhancement of gallbladder wall and a micro-perforation of the fundus. At laparoscopy, gallbladder gangrene was confirmed and a subtotal cholecystectomy performed. Special precautions were adopted for patient transportation from the ward to a dedicated operating room, and two teams with adequate personal protective equipment took charge of the procedure. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 under protective lockdown measures for 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of acute acalcolous gangrenous cholecystitis is multifactorial. It is unknown whether a prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 contributes to wall ischemia and perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be avoided in patients with gallbladder gangrene. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. However, personal protective equipment is key for prevention CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and surgical therapy are critical in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis. Subtotal laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gangrenous gallbladder is safe and effective.

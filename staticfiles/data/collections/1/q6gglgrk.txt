OBJECTIVE To discuss the learning curve of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with lymph node dissection and the oncological results and long-term outcomes of different periods in the learning stage. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-four patients with gastric cancer who received LADG with lymph node dissection from January 2004 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. They were divided into three groups (A-C) according to different operative date: 41 were in Group A (early), 41 in Group B (middle), and 42 in Group C (laer). There were no significant statistical differences among the three groups with respect to age, gender, early/advanced gastric cancer, Union for International Cancer Control stage, and lymph node dissection. Then the following items were compared in these groups: operative time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and long-term survival. RESULTS The operative time in Group A (235.0±50.3 minutes) was significantly longer than in Groups B (201.7±39.6 minutes) and C (199.0±44.7 minutes), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. The harvest of lymph nodes from Group A (11.0±5.5) was significantly less than from Groups B (16.3±9.2) and C (17.2±8.7), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C. The postoperative hospital stay and complications, overall survival, and disease-free survival showed no difference among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS The learning curve of gastrointestinal surgeons with experience of laparoscopic operation is about 40 cases. The oncological principles and long-term outcomes were not sacrificed during the learning stage.

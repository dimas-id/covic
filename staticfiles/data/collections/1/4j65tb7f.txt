To investigate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair in patients with inguinal hernia accompanied by liver cirrhosis.Between October 2015 and May 2018, 17 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent TEP repair were included in this study. The baseline characteristics, perioperative data, and recurrence were retrospectively reviewed.Seventeen patients with a mean duration of 18.23 ± 16.80 months were enrolled. All TEP repairs were successful without conversion to trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) surgery or open repair, but 4 patients had peritoneum rupture during dissection. The mean operation time was 54.23 ± 10.51 minutes for unilateral hernia and 101.25 ± 13.77 minutes for bilateral hernias. We found 2 cases with contralateral inguinal hernia and 2 cases with obturator hernia during surgery. The rate of complication was 17.65% (3/17), 2 of 3 cases were Child-Turcotte-Pugh C with large ascites. During a follow-up of 19.29 ± 9.01 months, no patients had recurrence and chronic pain, but 2 patients died because of the progression of underlying liver disease.Early and elective inguinal hernia repair is feasible and effective for patients with liver cirrhosis. TEP is a feasible and safe repair option for cirrhotic patients in experienced hands.

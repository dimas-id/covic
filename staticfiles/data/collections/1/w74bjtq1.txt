The average life span reported in laboratory and lay literature for the domestic rabbit is 5 to 10 years. The author and other veterinarians are now regularly seeing rabbits living to 9 or 10 years, the oldest reported in the author's practice being 14 years. Rabbits are herbivorous prey species with continually growing (elodont) teeth. This feature allows the geriatric rabbit to possess teeth that are essentially “new”, a distinct advantage over geriatric carnivores. Expanded longevity, while generally desirable, necessarily accompanies an increase in geriatric disorders. This article examines the spectrum of disease that can affect the geriatric rabbit as well as crucial factors concerning the clinical management of the animal up to the end of its life. An improved understanding of geriatric disorders in pet rabbits allows early recognition and the opportunity to improve quality of life.

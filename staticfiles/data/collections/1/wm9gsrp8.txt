OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic surgery for patients with ectopic pregnancies in unusual locations. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective case series of 31 patients from 6 weeks to 10 weeks postmenstrual who were referred for diagnosis and treatment and suspected of having an unruptured cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) or cornual pregnancy (CP). The diagnosis was confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound, and all of the patients underwent laparoscopic management. RESULTS A diagnosis of CSP or CP was confirmed in all of the patients during the laparoscopic procedure. None of the patients required conversion to laparotomy. The total operative time ranged from 40 minutes to 120 minutes. The total blood loss was limited, ranging from 30 mL to 200 mL. All of the women tolerated the operation well and had uneventful recoveries. CONCLUSION When performed by a well-trained gynecologist, laparoscopy appears to be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of unruptured CSP or CP.

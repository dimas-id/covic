BACKGROUND Does the type of dialysis treatment make a difference to the quality of life (QoL) and mental health of renal patients in Athens? The study investigated the differences in 84 in-center hemodialysis (HD) and 60 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD/PD) patients. METHODS Patient-reported assessments included: WHOQOL-BREF inventory of World Health Organization, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) of Goldberg, State-Trait Anxiety InÎ½entory, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC). RESULTS Results indicated that HD patients reported lower QoL in the environment and social relationships domains. More symptoms were also reported in the GHQ-28 subscales of anxiety/insomnia and severe depression. This measurement includes sleep problems and suicidal thoughts. CONCLUSIONS The findings confirm the differences between the two treatment modalities, indicating that HD patients have poorer QoL in several aspects of their environment and their social relationships. Both groups reported elevated depression. However, HD patients reported more suicidal thoughts and sleep problems compared to PD patients.

This case series examines cardiac MRI findings in four children and adolescents admitted to intensive care in April 2020 for multisystem inflammatory syndrome and Kawasaki disease-like features related to COVID-19. Acute myocarditis occurred less than 1 week after onset of fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical examination showed rash and cheilitis/conjunctivitis. All patients recovered after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative on nasopharyngeal, stool, and respiratory samples and was positive on serology. Cardiac MRI showed diffuse myocardial edema on T2-STIR sequences and native-T1 mapping, with no evidence of late gadolinium enhancement suggestive of replacement fibrosis or focal necrosis. These findings favor post-infectious myocarditis in children and adolescents with COVID-19.

Single-nanoparticle detection and sizing is demonstrated using a nanofiber pair in an aqueous environment. The sizing of nanoparticles with a single radius (100 nm) and of mixed nanoparticles with different radii (100 nm and 170 nm) are both realized, and the experimental results agree well with predictions of Rayleigh-Gans scattering, by taking the inhomogeneous field distribution of the nanofibers into account.

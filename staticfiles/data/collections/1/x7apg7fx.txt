Tylophora indica, a medicinal climber, belongs to the family, Asclepiadaceae. Roots and leaves of the plant contain several alkaloids including tylophorine, tylophorinine and tylophrinidine. The major alkaloid, tylophorine found in T. indica possesses several properties, such as immunosuppressive, antitumour, antifeedant, antibacterial, antifungal, antiamoebic, diuretic and hepatoprotective activities. In addition to this, tylophorine provides positive stimulation to adrenal cortex. Biotechnological production of tylophorine was fulfilled by inducing hairy roots mediated by Agrobacterium rhizogenes (A4 strain). It was followed by its growth in liquid suspension culture that could yield maximum biomass and tylophorine production. This type of liquid suspension culture yielded 9.8 ± 0.21 mgL(−1) tylophorine within 4–6 weeks of incubation. Maceration technique employed for the extraction of tylophorine was the most viable and efficient protocol. Although many reports are available regarding the biotechnological production of tylophorine, its competent and economic production still continues as a problematic issue.

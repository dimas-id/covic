Situs inversus (SI) is a rare condition involving transposition of internal organs. In performing minimally invasive surgeries for these patients, exact mirror image of the usual technique may not be easily achieved, especially for right-handed surgeons. We describe a case of robotic anterior resection in a patient with rectal cancer and SI, illustrating the technique and how robotic system facilitates the procedure. A 59-year-old gentleman presented with altered bowel habit. Colonoscopy showed an obstructing tumour at 10 cm from the anal verge. Computed tomography did not show distant metastasis, but revealed the diagnosis of SI. Intraoperative laparoscopy revealed peritoneal metastasis. Total robotic, single docking, anterior resection was performed to palliate his obstructive symptoms. The operation lasted for 3 h and 24 min. Blood loss was 100 ml. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on day four. The final pathology was T3N2M1.

Abstract A simple protocol for generating a highly stable and active surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface of recombinant human hexahistidine cyclophilin A (His-CypA) is described. The sensor surface was sensitive and stable enough to allow, for the first time, the screening and ranking of several novel small-molecule (M r ∼250–500Da) ligands in a competition binding assay with cyclosporin A (CsA). It also allowed us to accurately determine the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. His-CypA was first captured on a Ni2+–nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip and was then briefly covalently stabilized, coupling via primary amines. The significant baseline drift observed due to dissociation of weakly bound His-CypA from the Ni2+–NTA moiety was eliminated, resulting in a surface that was stable for at least 36h. In addition, immobilized protein activity levels were high, typically between 85 and 95%, assayed by the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA (K dCsA) binding to the immobilized His-CypA was 23±6nM, with on and off rates of 0.53±0.1μM−1 s−1 and 1.2±0.1 (×10−2) s−1, respectively. These values agree well with the values for the corresponding binding constants determined from steady-state and kinetic fluorescence titrations in solution.

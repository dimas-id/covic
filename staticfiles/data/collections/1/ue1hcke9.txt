Reverse genetics allows for the generation of recombinant viruses or vectors used in functional studies, vaccine development, and gene therapy. This technique enables genetic manipulation and cloning of viral genomes, gene mutation through site-directed mutagenesis, along with gene insertion or deletion, among other studies. An in vitro infection-based system including the highly attenuated vaccinia virus Ankara strain expressing the T7 RNA polymerase from bacteriophage T7, with co-transfection of three helper plasmids and a full-length cDNA plasmid, was successfully developed to rescue genetically modified Newcastle disease viruses in 1999. In this chapter, the materials and the methods involved in rescuing Newcastle disease virus (NDV) from cDNA, utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and gene replacement techniques, are described in detail.

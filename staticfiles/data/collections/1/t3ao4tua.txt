Abstract The recent identification of an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment has added to the complexity of the structural and functional organization of the early secretory pathway. Protein sorting along the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway depends on different signals and mechanisms, some of which guarantee recycling from various levels of the Golgi apparatus to biosynthetically earlier compartments.

COVID protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) has been checked to be blocked by inhibitors, and with particular successful performance by Î±-ketoamide derivative substrates like 13b of Hilgenfeld and coworkers. After the biological characterization, here DFT calculations do not only explain how the inhibitor 13b produces a thermodynamically favorable interaction, but how to reach it kinetically. The controversial and unprovable concept of aromaticity here enjoys being the agent that rationalizes the seemingly innocent role of histidine (His41 of Mpro). Not only does it have a H-bond with the hydroxyl group, but it is the proton carrier of the thiol of Cys145 at almost zero energy cost that favours the interaction with the inhibitor that acts as a Michael acceptor.

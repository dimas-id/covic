We have previously demonstrated the expression of aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) on synovial T cells from patients with different forms of arthritis. T cells of peripheral blood and serous body fluids are CD13-negative but can be stimulated to express CD13 after activation, e.g., with Con A. In the present report, double-labelling and flow cytometry analyses were performed to characterize the phenotype of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). A large panel of antibodies specific for different activation-associated molecules on T cells was used. In contrast to TIL of lung cancer, TIL of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) consisted of significantly higher percentages of T cells expressing CD13, dipeptidylpeptidase N (DPIV, CD26) and HLA-DR, whereas T cells of lung cancer expressed more CD25, CD69 and CD54/ICAM1. No differences could be found in the expression of CD45RO, CD49a/VLA-1 and CD62L/L-selectin. Our results demonstrate that T cells in RCC and lung cancer differ in their phenotype, especially with respect to surface aminopeptidases. Investigations into the function of APN on T cells could be of help in gaining deeper insight into tumour defence as well as into general mechanisms of T cell functions.

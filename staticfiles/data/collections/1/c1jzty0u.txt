BACKGROUND COVID-19 infection varies in severity from minimal symptoms to critical illness associated with a hyperinflammatory response. Data on disease progression in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are limited. METHODS We examined the electronic medical records of all SOT recipients with COVID-19 from 12 Massachusetts hospitals between February 1st and May 6th, 2020. We analysed the demographics, clinical parameters, course and outcomes of illness in these patients. RESULTS Of 52 COVID-19 positive SOT patients, 77% were hospitalized and 35% required ICU admission. Sixty nine percent of hospitalized patients had immunosuppression reduced, 6% developed suspected rejection. Co-infections occurred in 45% in ICU vs 5% in non-ICU patients (p=0.037). A biphasic pattern of evolution of laboratory tests was observed. In the first 5 days of illness, inflammatory markers were moderately increased. Subsequently, WBC, CRP, ferritin and D-dimer increased with increasing stay in the ICU, lymphocyte counts were similar. Five patients (16%) died. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that SOT is associated with high rate of hospitalization, ICU admission and death from COVID-19 compared to data in the general population of patients with COVID-19. Despite reduction in immunosuppression, suspected rejection was rare. The clinical course and trend of laboratory biomarkers is biphasic with a later, pronounced peak in inflammatory markers seen in those admitted to an ICU. CRP is a useful marker to monitor disease progression in SOT.

In transfusion medicine, several blood products can be prepared and used as replacement therapy; however, four of these products are more commonly used in general practice: RBCs, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets and cryoprecipitate. RBC transfusions are mainly administered to improve tissue oxygenation in cases of anaemia or acute blood loss due to trauma or surgery. FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate are used for the prevention and treatment of bleeding.

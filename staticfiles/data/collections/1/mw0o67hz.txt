What would it mean to explore such a title: ‘Art Education at the ‘End of the World’? And why at the ‘end’ of the world? It seems somewhat foreboding and disturbing. We live in a time of extraordinary complexity, made possible by the technological advances that have their nascent beginnings during the computer age in the 1950s just after World War II. The United States used 50% of the world’s resources at that time to industrialize its economy as Europe was devastated by the war. Many countries in Asia were also torn apart by various forms of military dictatorships, north-south rivalries, and communist revolutions. This has all changed now. Korea is a global economic force in its own right. The Samsung Empire rivals Apple’s Empire with their electronic products, while Kia Motors is equally worldwide, competing against giant corporations like Ford. Korea now belongs to the G-20 major economies of the world. This chapter addresses the changed reality.

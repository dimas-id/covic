[Image: see text] Worldwide outbreaks of infectious diseases necessitate the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. Colorimetric assays are a representative tool to simply identify the target molecules in specimens through color changes of an indicator (e.g., nanosized metallic particle, and dye molecules). The detection method is used to confirm the presence of biomarkers visually and measure absorbance of the colored compounds at a specific wavelength. In this study, we propose a colorimetric assay based on an extended form of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) self-assembly shielded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) under positive electrolyte (e.g., 0.1 M MgCl(2)) for detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This platform is able to verify the existence of viral molecules through a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) shift and color changes of AuNPs in the UV–vis wavelength range. We designed a pair of thiol-modified probes at either the 5′ end or 3′ end to organize complementary base pairs with upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frames (ORF) 1a on MERS-CoV. The dsDNA of the target and probes forms a disulfide-induced long self-assembled complex, which protects AuNPs from salt-induced aggregation and transition of optical properties. This colorimetric assay could discriminate down to 1 pmol/μL of 30 bp MERS-CoV and further be adapted for convenient on-site detection of other infectious diseases, especially in resource-limited settings.

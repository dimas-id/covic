Background: Brazil has the second largest COVID-19 number of cases, worldly. Even so, underdiagnosis in the country is massive. Nowcasting techniques have helped to overcome the underdiagnosis. Recent advances in machine learning techniques offer opportunities to refine the nowcasting. This study aimed to analyze the underdiagnosis of COVID-19, through nowcasting with machine learning, in a South of Brazil capital. Methods: The study has an observational ecological design. It used data from 3916 notified cases of COVID-19, from April 14th to June 02nd, 2020, in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. We used machine-learning algorithm to classify cases which had no diagnosis yet, producing the nowcast. To analyze the underdiagnosis, we compared the difference between the data without nowcasting and the median of the nowcasted projections for the entire period and for the six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis at the moment of data extraction. Results: The number of new cases throughout the entire period, without nowcasting, was 389. With nowcasting, it was 694 (UI95 496-897,025). At the six days period, the number without nowcasting was 19 and 104 (95% UI 60-142) with. The underdiagnosis was 37.29% in the entire period and 81.73% at the six days period. Conclusions: The underdiagnosis was more critical in six days from the date of onset of symptoms to diagnosis before the data collection than in the entire period. The use of nowcasting with machine learning techniques can help to estimate the number of new cases of the disease.

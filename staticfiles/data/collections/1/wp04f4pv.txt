BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The use of stents in the setting of SAH is controversial because of concerns about the efficacy and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy. We compare complications of stent-assisted coil embolization in patients with acutely ruptured aneurysms with complications in patients with unruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2007 and March 2015, 45 acutely ruptured aneurysms and 47 unruptured aneurysms were treated with stent-assisted coiling. Patients with ruptured aneurysms were not pretreated with antiplatelet medication but received intravenous aspirin during the procedure. Thromboembolic events and early rebleeds were recorded. RESULTS In ruptured aneurysms, 9 of 45 patients had thromboembolic complications. Four patients remained asymptomatic, 4 developed infarctions, and 1 patient died. The permanent complication rate in ruptured aneurysms was 11% (95% CI, 4%-24%). Five of 45 patients (11%; 95% CI, 4%-24%) had an early rebleed from the treated aneurysm after 3-45 days, and in 4, this rebleed was fatal. In 46 patients with 47 unruptured aneurysms, thromboembolic complications occurred in 2. One patient remained asymptomatic; the other had a thalamus infarction. The complication rate in unruptured aneurysms was 2.2% (1 of 46; 95% CI, 0.01%-12%). No first-time hemorrhages occurred in 46 patients with 47 aneurysms during 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The complication rate of stent-assisted coiling with early adverse events in ruptured aneurysms was 10 times higher than that in unruptured aneurysms. Early rebleed accounted for most mortality. In ruptured aneurysms, stent-assisted coil embolization is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and should only be considered when less risky options have been excluded.

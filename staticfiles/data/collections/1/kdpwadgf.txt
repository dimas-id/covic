Houttuynia cordata is one of the most potential medicinal and edible wild herb whose resources have decreased sharply due to excessive exploitation. Besides its slow agamic propagation, problems of browning and non-dedifferentiation have prevented the application of micropropagation in H. cordata. Through 4 week pre-culture in darkness and wounding after 1 week pre-culture, the browning rate of leaf explants decreased significantly and resulted in efficient regeneration (20.64 +/- 5.94 adventitious buds per explant) on the induction medium. The protocol shall facilitate conservation and commercial cultivation of the endangered species.

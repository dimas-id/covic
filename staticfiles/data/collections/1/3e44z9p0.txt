Abstract By using a growth accounting framework for the period 1980â€“2000, this paper estimates Hong Kong's total factor productivity and unit labor cost of twenty industries classified into three economic sectors of tradable goods, tradable services and non-tradable services. The results show that Hong Kong's total factor productivity has fallen in the 1990s. The competitiveness of the three sectors of tradable goods, tradable services and non-tradable services has increased, remained unchanged and declined, respectively in the last two decades. Policy recommendation for Hong Kong will be to aim for a supply-drive strategy so as to broaden the economic base.

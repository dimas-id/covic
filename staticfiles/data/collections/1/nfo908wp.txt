In this paper, a delayed SIQR epidemic model with vaccination and elimination hybrid strategies is analysed under a white noise perturbation. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of a positive solution. Afterwards, we establish a stochastic threshold [Formula: see text] in order to study the extinction and persistence in mean of the stochastic epidemic system. Then we investigate the existence of a stationary distribution for the delayed stochastic model. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to support our theoretical results.

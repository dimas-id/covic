Abstract S1D (residues 636–789) is a neutralizing epitope region on the spike protein (S) of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). To accurately identify epitopes on S1D, the S1-phage library containing the gene encoding the S1D region of PEDV S protein was micropanned by six specific monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the S1D region. These micropanned epitope regions (MER) were focused on 696–779 amino acids of the S protein. To further map epitopes of the MER, seven overlapping mini-fragments covering MER nucleotides were separately synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 with a GST tag. These mini-GST fusion proteins were scanned by ELISA and Western blotting with the six McAbs, and the result showed that S1D5 (residues 744–759) and S1D6 (residues 756–771) are two linear epitopes of the PEDV S protein. The antisera of the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 could react with the native S protein of PEDV. Furthermore, Pepscan of the two linear epitopes demonstrated that SS2 (748YSNIGVCK755) and SS6 (764LQDGQVKI771) are two core epitopes on S1D5 and S1D6, respectively, located on the S protein of PEDV.

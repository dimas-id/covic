BACKGROUND Different methods have been described for the reconstruction of cranial defects and orbital defects. The complex contouring between the orbital roof and frontal bone creates significant design challenges for prefabricated cranio-orbital reconstructions. In describing the first reported patient of combined skull and orbital roof reconstruction with a single-piece titanium plate cranioplasty, the authors present a new method of combined complex cranio-orbital reconstruction. METHODS A 63-year-old lady presented with a large, right-sided frontal en-plaque meningioma involving the right orbit and sphenoid wing. Complete resection would require reconstruction of both the skull and the orbital roof. Surgical preplanning involved marking resection margins on a three-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene model. This margin was used to virtually resect the tumor and generate a repaired surface. A titanium plate was then fabricated using hydrostatic pressing into a 3D-printed mold and the orbital roof portion (a reentrant surface) was hand-finished. Lateral canthus and temporalis muscle suspension holes were prefabricated into the cranioplasty plate. RESULTS The patient underwent hemicraniectomy and tumor resection guided by a custom-made 3D-printed cutting guide. The surgical defect was reconstructed with the prefabricated titanium plate achieving a good functional and cosmetic result. CONCLUSION Single-piece titanium plate cranioplasty is an effective novel reconstruction method for complex cranio-orbital defects.

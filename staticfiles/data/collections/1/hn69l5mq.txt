Antibodies to coronavirus were detected by an indirect fluorescent antibody test in rabbit sera from six rabbitries. The prevalence ranged from 3 to 40% in different rabbitries and most seropositive rabbits were more than 4 months old. A rabbitry with high prevalence of antibodies and high incidence of diarrhea could serve as a source of virus and aid in studying the natural history of coronavirus infection in rabbits.

In this article, we analyzed the effects of an educational glass recycling program on primary schools and their students in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). A sample of 89 schools, with 20,710 elementary students, was selected by simple random sampling. For the statistical analysis, descriptive techniques (frequencies and statistics), parametric (One Way ANOVA test), and non-parametric (Chi-Square test) inferential techniques were used, with a 5% significance level (p < 0.05). The program's results showed that 153,576.3 kg of glass (with a value of 17,064.03 â‚¬) were recycled. Significant determinants of glass recycling were: School category (p = 0.043), previous environmental/recycling education (p = 0.046), geographic location of school (p = 0.030), gender (p = 0.007), and academic year (p < 0.05). With the program, students learned the importance of glass recycling, obtained a greater knowledge of and habits related to the same, acquired favorable attitudes towards the environment, and promoted glass recycling in their social circles. We conclude that environmental education about glass recycling has positive effects on glass recycling attitudes and behaviors in elementary school students and may be used as a measure to combat the problem of environmental pollution.

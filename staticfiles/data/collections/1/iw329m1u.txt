INTRODUCTION Mobility decline compromises functionality and quality of life in old age. Life-Space Assessment (LSA) evaluates mobility considering interaction between person and environment. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a reference to identify and categorise the personal and environmental contextual factors associated to the LSA. Our objective is identifying contextual factors that may influence life-space mobility of older community-dwelling adults based on ICF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of literature will be performed to identify studies published between 1 January 2001 and 10 May 2017 which investigates life-space mobility among older adults. Keywords will be entered into the electronic databases of MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE (OVID), CINHAL (EBSCO), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Cochrane Central (OVID), PsycINFO (EBSCO) and COCH (OVID). Five investigators will work on search databases and standardised screening of the articles. Mobility predictors will be separated into personal and environmental aspects, according to the ICF model. The results will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, and then a meta-analysis will be performed, if applicable. DISCUSSION Knowledge about life-space mobility in community-dwelling older adults by examining related risk and protective aspects may help practitioners better approach older adults' mobility and prevent their decline in old age. Furthermore, researchers will have more clues for investigations into factors related to life-space mobility. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42017064552.

Group A rotaviruses (GARs) are one of the most common causes of diarrhea in suckling pigs. Although a number of G and P genotypes have been identified in porcine GARs, few attempts have been made to study the molecular epidemiology of these viruses associated with diarrhea outbreaks within a farm over an extended period of time. Here, we investigated the molecular characteristics of GARs that caused four outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year. G and P genotyping of GARs detected at each outbreak demonstrated genetic diversity in this farm as follows: G9P[23] was detected at the first outbreak, G9P[13]/[22] and G9P[23] at the second, G3P[7] at the third, and G9P[23], G5P[13]/[22], and P[7] combined with an untypeable G genotype at the fourth. Sequence analysis of the detected GARs revealed that such genetic diversity could have resulted not only from the introduction of new GAR strains, but also from gene reassortment between GAR strains within the farm. Further, the GAR strain carrying the untypeable G genotype was shown to be a novel porcine GAR bearing a new G26 genotype, as confirmed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.

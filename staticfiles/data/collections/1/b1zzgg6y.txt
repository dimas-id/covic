PURPOSE To evaluate the technical and clinical results of endovascular recanalization of thrombosed native hemodialysis fistula and the factors influencing patency. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted with 73 patients who had thrombosed arteriovenous fistulas and were treated with endovascular methods. Patient characteristics, arteriovenous fistula-related characteristics, and endovascular procedures were analyzed. Technical and clinical results and patency rates were evaluated. The factors influencing patency were analyzed using a univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS Technical and clinical success rates were 93% (68/73) and 85% (62/73), respectively. At 3, 6, and 12 months, the primary patency rates were 87.9%, 73.3%, and 64.8%; assisted primary patency rates were 89.2%, 78.6%, and 70.7%; and secondary patency rates were 90.8%, 87.2%, and 83.1%, respectively. Previous intervention and cephalic arch stenosis were risk factors for lower primary and assisted primary patency ( p < 0.05 for all). Cephalic arch stenosis was the only risk factor for lower secondary patency ( p < 0.05). No major complications associated with the procedures were noticed. CONCLUSION Endovascular treatment was effective for the immediate recanalization of thrombosed arteriovenous fistula. In addition, previous intervention and cephalic arch stenosis were significantly related to lower arteriovenous fistula patency.

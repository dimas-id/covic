The outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection fundamentally affects the lung field, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This process is an inflammatory picture, involving an NLRP3 inflamosome-triggered cytokine storm, the main player in alveolar destruction. IL-1 beta stands out among the cytokines that are triggered in this picture. Anakinra is a potent biological drug, capable of blocking this IL-1ÃŸ. We propose its use in controlling ARDS secondary to COVID-19 infection.

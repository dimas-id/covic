Abstract We describe an outbreak of rabies in a pack of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Limpopo-Lipadi Private Game and Wilderness Reserve in the Tuli region of south-eastern Botswana. We define the packâ€™s behavioural response to the disease, clinical signs, and management interventions undertaken and make recommendations to mitigate against future disease outbreaks of this nature. The outbreak, which occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, resulted in the death or disappearance of 29 individuals out of a pack of 35 wild dogs. The disruption to the social structure within the pack, the behaviour of the animals and clinical signs were similar to that documented during previous rabies outbreaks amongst African wild dogs in Southern and East Africa in recent years. Management interventions taken during the outbreak were aimed at preventing extirpation of the pack and reducing the risk of further disease spread to other mammals in the reserve.

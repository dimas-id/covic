Numerous human infections with avian influenza viruses in Asia in recent years have raised the concern that the next influenza pandemic is imminent. The most effective way to combat influenza is through the vaccination of the public. However, a minimum of 3â€“6 months is needed to develop an influenza vaccine using the traditional egg-based vaccine approach. The influenza hemagglutinin protein (HA), the active ingredient in the current vaccine, can be expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression vector system and purified rapidly. An influenza vaccine based on such a recombinant antigen allows a more timely response to a potential influenza pandemic. Here, we report an innovative monitoring assay for recombinant HA (rHA) expression and a rapid purification process. Various biochemical analyses indicate that the purified rHA is properly folded and biologically active.

A heterohybridoma was produced by the fusion of sensitized peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with a previously derived heteromyeloma, generated by the fusion of bovine PBLs with murine myeloma cells. The sensitized bovine PBLs were collected from a steer immunized with an oestradiol-ovalbumin conjugate. The cell lines resulting from the fusion were screened for the production of bovine antibodies to oestradiol. A stable heterohybridoma was isolated which secreted a bovine IgG(1) to oestrone/oestradiol. The use of sensitized PBLs together with heteromyeloma fusion partners has proved to be a reliable and simple way of producing monoclonal antibodies against specific haptens.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate surgically related quality outcomes during the learning curve for board-certified or board-eligible gynecologic oncologists developing "new-to-them" surgical techniques. METHODS The study design was a retrospective review of patients with endometrial cancer clinically limited to the uterus and/or cervix undergoing TLH-BSO or TAH-BSO, aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy(APLNDx), peritoneal washings with/without omentectomy from May 1996 to April /2006. A "senior" surgeon taught three board-certified or board-eligible gynecologic oncologists a "new-to-them" technique to perform both TLH-BSO and TAH-BSO with APLNDx using argon beam coagulation and endoscopic staplers in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. The main outcome measures were: a) length of surgery; b) surgical measures, e.g. lymph node count; and c) peri-operative morbidity. A comparison of outcomes with the "senior" surgeon was undertaken. The learning curve characteristics were analyzed by ANOVA and curve estimate analysis. RESULTS The mean operative times associated with learning a new technique to perform TLH-BSO with APLNDx and TAH-BSO with APLNDx were 155.39+/-26.32 and 102.28+/-34.22 min, respectively, with significant improvement after 20 cases (150.27+/-26.68 vs. 172.30+/-22.28, p=0.030) and 30 cases (93.30+/-24.97 vs. 124.63+/-29.73, p=0.030), respectively. Intra- and peri-operative morbidity and lymph node count were unaffected by experience. CONCLUSION While mean operative times decreased, outcome measures of surgical quality were not adversely affected during the learning curve for post-fellowship training while acquiring "new-to-them" surgical techniques. This study emphasizes the need for "senior" surgical supervision during the initial training period. The results of this study are likely transferable to fellowship-trained gynecologic oncologists learning other "new-to-them" surgical techniques and procedures.

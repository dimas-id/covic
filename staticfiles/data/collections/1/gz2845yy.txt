• In support of the theory that coronaviral ADRP enzymes evolved to counteract the anti-viral immune signaling mediated by PARP14, we present sequence homology between the ADP-ribose-binding sites of the two proteins. • Interestingly this homology is even more pronounced in bat species. • We believe this model provides crucial information for the consideration of potential therapeutic interventions, based on the PARP axis in COVID-19.

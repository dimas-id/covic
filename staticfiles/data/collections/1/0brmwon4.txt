Acute abdomen, abdominal trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding and gastrointestinal tumors are the main conditions that are routinely treated in gastrointestinal surgery department with high incidence and critical condition. These conditions need emergency or selective operations. During the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it's a great challenge for us to meet the patients' requirement under the situation. As the COVID-19 was brought under control in China, the Department of General Surgery in Nanfang Hospital resumed regular medical services gradually. Based on our clinical practice, the four major measures of strengthening pre-hospital screening, perioperative prevention and control, medical staff protection, and ward management were adopted. These main measures include the strict implementation of the appointment system and triage system before admission; the conduction of epidemiological and preliminary screening of viral nucleic acids; the chest CT examination during the perioperative period to re-screen COVID-19; the reduction of the risk of droplets and aerosol transmission; the minimally invasive surgery combined with enhanced recovery program in order to reduce patient's susceptibility and shorten the length of postoperative hospital stay; the reinforcement of specific infection control training for medical staff; the strict implementation of hierarchical protection; the establishment of gastrointestinal surgery prevention and control system; the rehearsal of emergency exercise; the installation of quarantine wards; the screening and management of family care-givers; the strict disinfection of environment and materials. Our preliminary practice shows that following the work guidelines issued by the Guangdong Province COVID-19 Prevention and Control Office and adopting precise management strategies in combination with the specific clinical features of gastrointestinal surgery, it is possible to safely resume regular care for the patients and comply to epidemic control at the same time.

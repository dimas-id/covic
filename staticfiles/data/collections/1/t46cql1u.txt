As many countries plan to lift lockdown measures aimed at suppression of COVID-19, data from early regional epidemics in Italy were analysed to ascertain the effectiveness of the timing of preventative measures. The cumulative caseload data were extracted from regional epidemics in Italy. Epidemic features in regions where lockdown was applied early were compared to those where lockdown was applied later for statistical differences. There were statistically significant differences in the timing of the peak, the cumulative incidence at peak and the case/km2 at peak between regions where the lockdown had been applied early and those where it was applied late. The peak occurred 7 days earlier with four times less cases/km2 in regions where the lockdown was applied within 10 days of the start of the epidemic. Cumulative caseloads, cases/km2 and/or the number of days into an epidemic can be used to plan future localised suppression measures as part of a national postlockdown policy. There were 350 (95% confidence interval (CI) 203) cumulative cases and 2.4 (CI 1.1) cases/km2 on day 8 of the regional epidemics.

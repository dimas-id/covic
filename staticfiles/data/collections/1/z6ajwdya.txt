Abstract DEAD/DEAH-box helicases are enzymes that belong to the DEAD/H-box family of SF2 helicase superfamily. These enzymes are essential in RNA metabolism, where they are involved in a number of processes that require manipulation of RNA structure. Recent studies have found that some DEAD/DEAH-box helicases play important roles in innate immunity, where they act as sensors of cytosolic DNA/RNA, as adaptor proteins, or as regulators of signaling and gene expression. In spite of their function in immunity, DEAD/DEAH-box helicases can also be hijacked and exploited by viruses to circumvent detection and aid in viral replication. These findings not only imply that DEAD/DEAH-box helicases have a broader function than previously thought, but also give us a much better understanding of immune mechanisms and diseases that arise due to the dysregulation or evasion thereof. In this chapter, we demonstrate the known scope of activities of human DEAD/DEAH-box helicases in innate immunity and interaction with viruses or other pathogens. Additionally, we give an outline of diseases in which they are, or may be, involved in the context of immunity.

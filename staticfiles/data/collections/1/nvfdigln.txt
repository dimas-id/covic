The case history of a 56-year-old man is described who suffered from severe adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. The clinical course was complicated by simultaneous infections with Pneumocystis carinii, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Herpes simplex, which proved to be fatal. A study of the literature shows that opportunistic infections in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are associated with severe cortisol excess and carry a high mortality. Opportunistic infections are most prevalent in the ectopic ACTH syndrome, explained by the very high plasma cortisol concentrations in this condition. Infections with Aspergillus species, Cryptoccus neoformans, Pneumocystis carinii and Nocardia asteroides predominated. Cushing’s syndrome with a very high plasma cortisol concentration causes a severe immunocompromized state. Prompt evaluation of the cause of the hypercortisolism, initiation of cortisol lowering therapy, primary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii infection when plasma cortisol exceeds 2500 nmol L(−1) and a search for concomitant infectious disease is recommended.

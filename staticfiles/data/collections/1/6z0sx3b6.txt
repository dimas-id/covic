In newborn infants, pulmonary hemorrhage, often a manifestation of pulmonary edema can range in severity from bloodtinged secretions in the endotracheal tube to life threatening blood loss with hypovolemic shock. It usually presents in the second to fourth day of life and may be associated with lung tissue damage (RDS, infection, and mechanical ventilation with high-inspired oxygen), hypoxia, hypervolemia, hypoproteinemia, congestive heart failure, and coagulation abnormalities. Klukow confirmed an association between pulmonary hemorrhage and a large patent ductus arteriosus with high pulmonary blood flow [1].

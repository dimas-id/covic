Aim The aim of this study was to report the feasibility of robotic-assisted dual kidney transplantation (DKT) in a marginal donor. Materials and Methods The case was a 53-year-old male, who with IgA nephropathy underwent a robotic-assisted robotic DKT. Results The total operating time was 265 min, total console time was 215 min, and anastomotic time was 39 min for both the kidneys, and blood loss was 220 ml. The total drain output was 150 ml on the 1st day. The drain was removed after 48 h and Foley catheter was removed after 5 days. Nadir creatinine was 1.1 mg/dl and time to nadir creatinine was 7 days. The patient received one unit of blood transfusion. Total postoperative hospital stay was 7 days and bilateral ureteric stents were removed after 14 days. At the end of 3 months, creatinine was 1.0 mg% and epidermal growth factor receptor was 82 ml/min/1.73 m2. Conclusion Robotic DKT offers solutions to the challenges faced in open DKT.

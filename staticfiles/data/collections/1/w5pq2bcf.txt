Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread like wildfire and affected almost every stratum of society. It has brought humans together and taught us to have compassion and collaboration among individuals, governments and organisations. Adequate protection of healthcare workers who are at the frontline must be taken care of. Good hygiene and social distancing go a long way in controlling an epidemic. We must strive towards building more balanced and sustainable models and healthcare systems in the future as we try to successfully emerge from this outbreak.

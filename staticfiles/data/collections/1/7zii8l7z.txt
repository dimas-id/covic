Polynomials which arise via elimination can be difficult to compute explicitly. By using a pseudo-witness set, we develop an algorithm to explicitly compute the restriction of a polynomial to a given line. The resulting polynomial can then be used to evaluate the original polynomial and directional derivatives along the line at any point on the given line. Several examples are used to demonstrate this new algorithm including examples of computing the critical points of the discriminant locus for parameterized polynomial systems.

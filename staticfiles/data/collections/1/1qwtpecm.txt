Background: The COVID-19 New Mum Study is recording maternal experiences and infant feeding during the period of UK lockdown. This report from week 1 of the survey aims to (1) provide information relevant for those supporting this population; (2) identify groups currently under-represented in the survey. Methods: Women living in the UK aged [≥]18 years with an infant [≤]12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey (https://is.gd/covid19newmumstudy). Information/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. Results: Between May 27th and June 3rd 2020, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married/with partner, 66% degree/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered before lockdown (BL) and 316 (23%) during lockdown (DL). Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (p<0.001) and 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed or mixed fed versus 39% of BL (p<0.05). Thirteen % reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient support with feeding. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%/9% contacted a mental health professional and 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact and support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby. Conclusion: Lockdown has had an impact on maternal experiences, resulting in distress for many women. Survey participants are currently not representative of the population; notably, groups at greater risk are under-represented. Increasing the diversity of participants is a priority.

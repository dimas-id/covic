BACKGROUND The surgical management of celiac artery compression syndrome (CACS) is controversial. Controversies include the appropriate surgical technique, the surgical approach, and the utility of postoperative stents. The literature is reviewed, and a case of CACS is presented in which a robotic-assisted division of the median arcuate ligament (MAL) was performed. METHODS Robotic-assisted treatment of celiac artery syndrome was carried out using six (five 1 cm and one 2 cm) abdominal incisions. The robotic device was used to expose the aorta and celiac artery and divide the median arcuate ligament. RESULTS Postoperatively, the patient's postprandial abdominal pain subsided. On 16 month follow-up, the patient was doing well, tolerated an unrestricted diet without symptoms, and exhibited weight gain. CONCLUSION This case is the second reported in the literature and demonstrates that the robotic approach to division of the MAL is feasible, safe, and efficacious.

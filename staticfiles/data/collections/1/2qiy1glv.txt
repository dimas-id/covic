A decline in immune function is a hallmark of aging that leads to complicated illness from a variety of infectious diseases, cancer and other immune-mediated disorders, and may limit the ability to appropriately respond to vaccination. How vaccines might alter the senescent immune response and what are the immune correlates of protection will be addressed from the perspective of 1) stimulating a previously primed response as in the case of vaccines for seasonal influenza and herpes zoster, 2) priming the response to novel antigens such as pandemic influenza or other viruses, 3) vaccination against bacterial pathogens such as pneumococcus, and 4) altering the immune response to an endogenous protein as in the case of a vaccine against Alzheimerâ€™s disease. In spite of the often limited efficacy of vaccines for older adults, influenza vaccination remains the only cost-saving medical intervention in this population. Thus, considerable opportunity exists to improve current vaccines and develop new vaccines as a preventive approach to a variety of diseases in older adults. Strategies for selecting appropriate immunologic targets for new vaccine development and evaluating how vaccines may alter the senescent immune response in terms of potential benefits and risks in the preclinical and clinical trial phases of vaccine development will be discussed.

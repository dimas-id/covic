Eight young thoroughbred horses, taken 1858 km by road (travelling time, 41 h), were exmanined toassess the pathological nature of respiratory disease associated with transport. Three of the horses showed clinical abnormalities including pyrexia, coughing, leucocytosis and neutrophilia after the first 20 h of transportation. Endoscopical examination of the trachea revealed exacerbation of airway inflammation as a result of transport in two of the three affected horses. A consistent finding in the affected horses was focal serous neutrophilic pneumonia affecting the cranio-ventral portion of the caudal lung lobe with a propensity to affect the right lung. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus was isolated from the pneumonic areas, in which corresponding bacterial antigens were identified immunohistochemically. Viral cultures from the pneumonic lesions proved negative for respiratory viruses. It is suggested that transport predisposes the upper respiratory tract and the lower airways to invasion by the bacterium, with episodic pyrexia and acute pneumonia.

Chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons have been used since antiquity. Examples of their recent use include war fighting, ethnic conflict, terrorism and assassination. In addition, CBRN incidents have also included accidental releases during peace time operations, and many of the principles for CBRN incident response can be applied to other hazardous material (HAZMAT) incidents. The impact of such weapons may have a range of implications for medical personnel both military and civilian.

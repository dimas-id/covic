BACKGROUND Wide-necked anterior communicating artery aneurysms represent a subset of lesions with challenging endovascular treatment despite new endoluminal and intrasaccular devices. OBJECTIVE To assess the long-term clinical and angiographic outcomes of stent-assisted embolization for wide-necked anterior communicating artery aneurysms. METHODS Between March 2008 and March 2014, 32 patients with unruptured wide-necked AComm aneurysms were treated using stent-assisted embolization. The Glasgow Outcome Scale was reviewed at the time of discharge and at latest follow-up. Ischemic and hemorrhagic events were also recorded and analyzed. Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated post-intervention and on subsequent follow-up evaluations. RESULTS Successful stent deployment was achieved in all cases, but in 1 patient the coils could not be contained inside the aneurysm, and the procedure was aborted without complications. The distal segment of the stent was positioned in the ipsilateral A2 in 16 patients, in the contralateral A2 in 15 patients, and in the contralateral A1 in 1 patient. There were no periprocedural thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications. The rate of major complications was 6%. One patient developed intracranial hemorrhage related to antiplatelet therapy and another had ischemic events due to in-stent stenosis. Angiographic follow-up was available for 26 aneurysms and during a mean follow-up of 22 months, 81% of the lesions were completely occluded and 8% had a small residual neck. The retreatment rate for residual aneurysms was 3%. CONCLUSION Our long-term results suggest that stent-assisted embolization for anterior communicating artery aneurysms may be considered an excellent treatment option with an adequate combination of safety profile and effectiveness.

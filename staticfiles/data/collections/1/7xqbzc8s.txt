The Achilles tendon is the thickest and strongest tendon in the human body. In spite of this, it is also one of the most frequently ruptured tendons. This article reviews the history of and debate about the appropriate course of treatment. A case study of an Achilles repair illustrates that the use soft tissue matrices is a successful adjunct to both the primary repair and gastrocnemius recession, with full return to activity and no inflammatory response at long-term follow up. The authors anticipate that the use of soft tissue matrices for the repair of tendon and soft tissue defects will expand over time as this material has distinct advantages over synthetics and highly crosslinked biologic materials.

Purpose: To investigate the possibility of ocular involvement in the 2019-novel coronavirus infectious (2019-nCoV) and vital preventive measures in the field of ophthalmology.Methods: All the studies that were most relevant to the 2019-nCoV ocular involvement and routes of transmission, especially in the field of ophthalmology, thoroughly reviewed.Results: From the ocular perspective, conjunctivitis may be the first presenting symptom of 2019-nCoV, so, we as ophthalmologists are at the forefront of exposure with newly infected patients. Although transconjunctival aerosol is a suspected but, the main route of transmission is the known respiratory droplets which will be more significant due to close contact in the field of ophthalmology. This review advise a set of recommendation for preventive care to minimize cross-infection of 2019-nCoV.Conclusions: Ophthalmologists have an essential role in guiding cross-infection control measures between patients and staff. Until a vaccine is created, public health strategies are likely the best weapons against this invisible enemy.

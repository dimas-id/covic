Abstract An integrated reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) microdevice which consists of microbead-assisted RNA purification and RT-LAMP with real-time monitoring by a miniaturized optical detector was demonstrated. The integrated RT-LAMP microdevice includes four reservoirs for a viral RNA sample (purified influenza A viral RNA or lysates), a washing solution (70% ethanol), an elution solution (RNase-free water), and an RT-LAMP cocktail, and two chambers (a waste chamber and an RT-LAMP reaction chamber). The separate reservoirs for a washing solution, an elution solution, and an RT-LAMP cocktail were designed with capillary valves for stable storage. Three influenza A virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and A/H5N1) were used for RNA templates, and RT-LAMP primer sets were designed to detect hemagglutinin (HA) and conserved M gene. Sequential sample flow to the microbeads for RNA purification was achieved by centrifugal force with optimization of capillary valves and a siphon channel. Furthermore, the purified RNA solution was successfully isolated from the waste solution by changing the rotational direction, and combined with the RT-LAMP cocktail in the RT-LAMP reaction chamber for target gene amplification. Total process from the sample injection to the result was completed in 47min. Influenza A H1N1 virus was confirmed on the integrated RT-LAMP microdevice even with 10 copies of viral RNAs, which revealed 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of a conventional RT-PCR. Subtyping and specificity test of influenza A H1N1 viral lysates were also performed and clinical samples were successfully genotyped to confirm influenza A virus on our proposed integrated microdevice.

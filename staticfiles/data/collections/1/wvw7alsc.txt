Plants continue to be a major source for new chemical entities to develop novel therapeutic agents. Large number of plants has been shown to be active in vitro against a variety of human pathogenic viruses or their near congeners. In several cases the active compounds have been isolated and characterized. Very few of them, however, have been investigated in detail in vivo or taken to the clinic. Pure compounds like andrographolide, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid as well as extracts of Azadirachta indica have shown activity against several viruses and should be investigated further for their therapeutic potential. An analysis of available data from several hundred species indicates that antiviral activity is more likely to be found in plants belonging to certain families. It is necessary to screen more plants of these families which are available in India to obtain further leads.

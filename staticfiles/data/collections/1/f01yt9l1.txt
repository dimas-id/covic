In this paper, we present the results of a case study conducted to validate the effectiveness of our gamification analytics model for teachers proposed in [20]. To conduct this case study, we developed a tool to monitor and adapt gamification designs in gamified adaptive educational systems. Employing this tool, the case study was conducted in a real situation, and the findings suggest that the use of our model and tool improves studentsâ€™ engagement, learning outcomes, and motivation.

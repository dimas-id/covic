Less invasive endovenous techniques have been shown to be as effective as open surgery in the treatment of varicose veins. Furthermore, they cause less postoperative bruising and pain and enable early return to normal activities and work. Tumescent anaesthesia is safe and obviates complications of general or spinal anaesthesia. Drawbacks are a steep learning curve and painful administration during treatment. Tumescentless techniques like Clarivein™ or VenaSeal™ Sapheon Closure System are recently under investigation. Short-term results of VenaSeal™ are comparable with thermal ablation. The procedure is safe without serious adverse events. Perioperative pain and patient discomfort with this tumescentless approach is minimal but postoperative recovery is temporarily hindered by thrombophlebitis in 14-15 % of patients. One-year results in a small feasibility study has demonstrated durable closure at this endpoint. No longer-term results are available. A randomized control trial between VenaSeal™ and Covidien ClosureFast™ is in a preparatory phase.

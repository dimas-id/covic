BACKGROUND: Wheezing illnesses among young children are common, and are a risk factor for asthma. However, determinants of childhood bronchial reactivity, a key feature of asthma, are largely unknown. Aim of this study was to determine how patient characteristics during the first severe virus-induced wheezing episode are associated with pulmonary function at pre-school age. METHODS: Study consisted of 76 children presenting with their first wheezing episode at the ages of 3 to 23 months. At study entry, viral etiology, rhinovirus genome load, atopic and clinical characteristics, and standardized questionnaire were analyzed. At 4-year follow-up visit, impulse oscillometry with exercise challenge was performed. RESULTS: At study entry, the mean age of the children was 12 months (SD 6.0), 57 (75%) were rhinovirus positive and 22 (30%) were sensitized. At follow-up visit four years later, the mean age of the children was 60 months (SD 7.9) and 37 (49%) were using asthma medication regularly (discontinued before testing in 25 [68%] children). Bronchial reactivity (â‰¥35% change in mean crude values of resistance) after exercise challenge or bronchodilation was present in 9 (12%) children. Children with atopic sensitization at the time of the first wheezing episode were more often likely to develop bronchial reactivity (odds ratio 8.8, P = .03) than the children without sensitization. No other significant associations were found. CONCLUSIONS: Atopic sensitization at the time of the first severe wheezing episode is an important early risk factor for increased bronchial reactivity at pre-school age.

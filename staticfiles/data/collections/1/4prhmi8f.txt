The sudden and rapid advancement of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unanticipated and unprecedented global crisis. Since its emergence in the United States, there is increasing discussion surrounding the impact of the virus among vulnerable populations. Older adults, young children, and persons with chronic medical or mental health conditions, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, immunocompromised persons and those who are institutionalized or homeless are considered most vulnerable to death and lost quality of life (World Health Organization, 2020).

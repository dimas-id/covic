Currently, the pathogenic role of Ehrlichia canis in cats has been proposed predominantly on the basis of the serologic evidence of natural infection and the infrequent detection of morulae窶人ike structures within the cytoplasm of leukocytes in cats. The purpose of this report was to provide molecular evidence supporting E cams窶人ike infection in 3 cats that had clinical manifestations consistent with canine ehrlichiosis but lacked antibodies to E canis antigens. Serum from all 3 cats contained antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The predominant disease manifestation was polyarthritis in 1 cat and bone marrow hypoplasia or dysplasia, accompanied by pancytopenia or anemia and thrombocytopenia, in 1 cat each. The alignment of E canis partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA; 382 nucleotide positions), amplified from EDTA blood samples from each cat, was identical to each other and was identical to a canine isolate of E canis (GenBank accession number AF373613). In 1 cat, concurrent treatment with corticosteroids may have interfered with the therapeutic effectiveness of doxycycline for the elimination of E canis窶人ike infection. To further define the spectrum of ehrlichiosis in cats, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may be necessary until serologic testing is thoroughly validated in experimentally or naturally infected cats. In addition, until E canis has been isolated from cats and several tissue culture isolates are available from disparate geographic regions for detailed comparative genetic study, the molecular evidence presented in this study supporting E canis窶人ike infection in cats must be interpreted with caution.

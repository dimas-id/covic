Identification of specific epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies is essential to advance epitope-based vaccine design strategies. We report a methodology for rapid epitope mapping of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 Env at single residue resolution, using viral neutralization assays and deep sequencing. We extended our methodology to map multiple specificities of epitopes targeted in polyclonal sera, elicited in immunized animals as well as in HIV-1 infected patients.

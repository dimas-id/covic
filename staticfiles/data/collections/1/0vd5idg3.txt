The COVID-19 pandemic poses daily challenges to the entire oncology workforce. Staff members must absorb multiple executive briefings, adapt to escalating scenario modelling, and seamlessly execute ever-changing operational modes in real-time. The unique threat of looming re-deployment and rationing care add to the uncertainty. We highlight the need for qualitative research to understand the psychosocial impact of these challenges. We posit that the perspective of all team members should be explored: from doctors to ancillary staff.

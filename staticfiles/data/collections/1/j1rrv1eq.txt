Abstract General medical training programs are aimed at promoting competency in general practice skills with a holistic perspective of patient-centered medicine for the new generation of physicians. The faculty development program was implemented to promote learning and application of the six core competencies established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. This article describes the implementation and outcome of the current faculty development program. Additional assessment tools of the faculty development program are recommended to evaluate different perspectives of outcome. Our experience suggests that OSTEs are a realistic and well-received approach for faculty development that merits further investigation. According to the clinical instructors' response, our faculty development program effectively increased familiarity with various teaching and assessment skills needed to teach PGY 1 residents and ACGME competencies, and these clinical instructors also then subsequently applied these skills.

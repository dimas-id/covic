Abstract: In “An Essay on the Principle of Population” (1798), Thomas Malthus established one of the first scenarios that linked natural constraints (agricultural production) with demography and economic growth. This essay was an essential contribution not only to the development of economic theories but also to ecological and evolutionary theories with the concept of a limiting capacity within a given environment. The Malthusian view of human demography is at the core of the book by Ehrlich and Ehrlich “The Population Bomb”, which called for active control of births in order to avoid famine, resource depletion and corporate collapse.

Upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is a general term for a heterogeneous group of illnesses caused by numerous etiologic agents that affect the mucosal lining of the upper respiratory tract, including the middle-ear cavity and paranasal sinuses. URIs are primarily caused by viruses, rhinoviruses being the most common etiological agents. Respiratory viruses transmit easily via direct contact or aerosols. The incidence of URI is highest in children who suffer 6–8 infections per year. The main symptoms of URI are nasal blockage and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. Fever occurs variably, most commonly in children. Viral URIs often predispose to bacterial complications. Acute otitis media is the most common complication in children, whereas sinusitis and pneumonia are more frequent in adults and the elderly. The treatment of URI is mainly symptomatic because specific antivirals are available only for influenza viruses. Antibiotics have no efficacy for viral URI but are commonly used for treating acute otitis media and sinusitis. Most URIs are self-limited illnesses with an average duration of 7–10 days and an excellent prognosis.

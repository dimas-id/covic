A hand-reared raccoon (Procyon lotor) kit had severe diarrhea and died within 24 hr. Gross and histopathologic findings were compatible with a diagnosis of viral enteritis. The immunoperoxidase test revealed rotavirus group A antigen in the intestinal mucosa. This is the first record of rotaviral enteritis in a raccoon.

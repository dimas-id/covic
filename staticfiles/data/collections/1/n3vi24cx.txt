BACKGROUND Totally laparoscopic liver resection of lesions located in the posterosuperior segments is reported to be technically challenging. This study aimed to define whether these technical difficulties affect the surgical outcome. METHODS A total of 220 patients underwent laparoscopic liver resection during 244 procedures from August 1998 to December 2010. The patients who underwent primary minor single liver resection for malignant tumors affecting either posterosuperior segments 1, 7, 8, and, 4a (group 1) or anterolateral segments 2, 3, 5, 6, and 4b (group 2) were included in the study. Seventy-five procedures found to be eligible for the study, including 28 patients in group 1 and 47 patients in group 2. Intraoperative unfavorable incidents were graded on the basis of the Satava approach and postoperative complications were graded in agreement with the Accordion classification. RESULTS The operative time (median, 127 min) and blood loss (median, 200 ml) were equivalent in the two groups. The rates for blood transfusions and intraoperative accidents did not differ statistically between the groups. A tumor-free margin resection was achieved in 94.7% of the procedures, equivalently in both groups. The postoperative course was similar in the two groups. Postoperative complications developed in 2 cases (7.1%) in group 1 and 2 cases (4.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.626). The median hospital stay was 2 days in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic liver resection for lesions located in posterosuperior segments represents certain technical challenges. However, appropriate adjustment of surgical techniques and optimal patient positioning enables the laparoscopic technique to provide safe and effective parenchyma-sparing resections for lesions located in both posterosuperior and anterolateral segments.

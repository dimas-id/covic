Mice with a severe combined immunodeficiency in B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (SCID-beige) were inoculated intranasally with sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus, a coronavirus of rats. Animals were killed at designated intervals and tissues were examined for evidence of viral infection by light microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy. Based on these criteria, there was no evidence that these immunodeficient mice were susceptible to infection with SDA virus.

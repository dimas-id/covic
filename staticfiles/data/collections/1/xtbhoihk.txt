Transverse-sigmoid dural arteriovenous fistulas (TS DAVFs) can be challenging to treat by endovascular means. Indeed, a total cure of the fistula can only be achieved when complete occlusion of the fistulous point(s) is obtained by penetration of the embolic agent. However, in some cases, especially for transosseous branches from extracranial arteries like the occipital artery (OcA) or the superficial temporal artery (STA), such penetration is usually poor, leading to major proximal reflux and incomplete fistula obliteration. We present three cases of embolization in two patients with TS DAVF through the OcA and/or the STA with OnyxÂ® using a double-lumen balloon (Microvention, Tustin, CA, USA). This technique allows the penetration of the embolic agent in the transosseous branches by forming a counter-pressure with the inflated balloon. This technique may be useful to achieve complete occlusion of TS DAVFs by endovascular means.

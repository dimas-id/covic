In a comprehensive worldwide assessment of cancer risk related to food and nutrition, the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR 2007) identified alcohol consumption as a “convincing” or “probable” risk factor for esophageal, mouth, and laryngeal cancers, for liver cancer, for breast cancer in women, and for colorectal cancer especially in men. The World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease Project concluded that “A total of 390,000 cases of cancer are attributable to alcohol drinking worldwide, representing 3.6% of all cancers (5.2% in men, 1.7% in women)” each year, with a corresponding annual mortality rate of 233,000, representing 3.5% of all cancer deaths (Boffetta et al. 2006). For the USA, the Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) report indicates an annual rate of 2,464 deaths in six different alcohol-related cancer categories for the period 2001–2006 (CDC 2010).

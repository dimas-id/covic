Submental or submandibular intubation has been reported to cause fewer complications than tracheostomy. However, the risk of infection is always inherent because oral wounds are exposed to microbial flora and bacteria in the oral cavity. A novel technique of submandibular intubation was devised to reduce infection and injury to the soft tissues. We would like to report a novel safe technique that can be performed in patients requiring submental or submandibular intubation. This is the first report of submandibular intubation using a sterile disposable camera cable drape. This novel technique of submandibular intubation is safer, more sterile, easier, and less invasive than conventional submandibular intubation.

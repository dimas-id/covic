BACKGROUND Brain imaging is logistically the most difficult step before thrombolysis. To improve door-to-needle time (DNT), it is important to understand if (1) longer door-to-imaging time (DIT) results in longer DNT, (2) hospitals have different DIT performances, and (3) patient and hospital characteristics predict DIT. METHODS Prospectively collected data in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke-EAST (SITS-EAST) registry from Central/Eastern European countries between 2008 and 2011 were analyzed. Hospital characteristics were obtained by questionnaire from each center. Patient- and hospital-level predictors of DIT of 25 minutes or less were identified by the method of generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Altogether 6 of 9 SITS-EAST countries participated with 4212 patients entered into the database of which 3631 (86%) had all required variables. DIT of 25 minutes or less was achieved in 2464 (68%) patients (range, 3%-93%; median, 65%; and interquartile range, 50%-80% between centers). Patients with DIT of 25 minutes or less had shorter DNT (median, 60 minutes) than patients with DIT of more than 25 minutes (median, 86 minutes; P < .001). Four variables independently predicted DIT of 25 minutes or less: longer time from stroke onset to admission (91-180 versus 0-90 minutes; odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.8), transport time of 5 minutes or less (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7-4.7) between the place of admission and a computed tomography (CT) scanner, no or minimal neurologic deficit before stroke (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.5), and diabetes mellitus (OR, .8; 95% CI, .7-.97). CONCLUSIONS DIT should be improved in patients arriving early and late. Place of admission should allow transport time to a CT scanner under 5 minutes.

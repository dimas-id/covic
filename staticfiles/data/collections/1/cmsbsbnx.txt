BACKGROUND For patients with acute ischemic stroke, intra-arterial treatment (IAT) is considered to be an effective strategy for removing the obstructing clot. Because outcome crucially depends on time to treatment ('time-is-brain' concept), we assessed the effects of an intervention based on performing all the time-sensitive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at a single location on the delay before intra-arterial stroke treatment. METHODS Consecutive acute stroke patients with large vessel occlusion who obtained IAT were evaluated before and after implementation (April 26, 2010) of an intervention focused on performing all the diagnostic and therapeutic measures at a single site ('stroke room'). RESULT After implementation of the intervention, the median intervals between admission and first angiography series were significantly shorter for 174 intervention patients (102 min, interquartile range (IQR) 85-120 min) than for 81 control patients (117 min, IQR 89-150 min; p < 0.05), as were the intervals between admission and clot removal or end of angiography (152 min, IQR 123-185 min vs. 190 min, IQR 163-227 min; p < 0.001). However, no significant differences in clinical outcome were observed. CONCLUSION This study shows for the, to our knowledge, first time that for patients with acute ischemic stroke, stroke diagnosis and treatment at a single location ('stroke room') saves crucial time until IAT.

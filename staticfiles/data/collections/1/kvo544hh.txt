The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The sample consisted of 529 students. The tools used to measure the relationship between emotional intelligence and entrepreneurial self-efficacy were the Emotional Intelligence Scale developed by Wong and Law and the Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy Scale developed by Zhan. The results showed that there was a significant difference between male and female college students in entrepreneurial self-efficacy, but no significant difference between male and female college students in emotional intelligence. In entrepreneurial self-efficacy as well as emotional intelligence, there were significant differences between the third grade and the first and second grade, respectively. In addition, the results showed a significant positive correlation between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and emotional intelligence. With the improvement of the emotional intelligence level of vocational college students, the entrepreneurial self-efficacy will increase. The lower the emotional intelligence, the faster the improvement in entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The higher the emotional intelligence, the more stable the entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The university stage is considered an ideal entrepreneurial period, especially for vocational collegesâ€™ students, who pay more attention to entrepreneurship and innovation education. Encouraging the cultivation of the emotional intelligence of vocational college students in life will help to improve personal entrepreneurial self-efficacy. This research emphasizes that improving the emotional intelligence of vocational college students can enhance their sense of self-efficacy in entrepreneurship and help students with entrepreneurship and career development.

Background: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor prevalent in adolescents with poor prognosis. Toona sinensis showed potent antiproliferation effect on lung, melatonin, ovary, colon, and liver cancers. However, the effects of the species on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated. Results: In this study, we found fraction 1 of Toona sinensis leaf (TSL-1) resulted in inhibition of cell viability in MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines, while it only caused a moderate suppressive effect on normal osteoblasts. In addition, TSL-1 significantly elevated lactate dehydrogenase leakage and induced apoptosis and necrosis in Saos-2 cells. TSL-1 increased mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic factor Bad. Most important, TSL-1 significantly suppressed Saos-2 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice by increasing caspase-3. The IC-50 of TSL-1 for the 3 tested osteosarcoma cells is around 1/9 of that for lung cancer cells. Conclusion: We demonstrated that TSL-1, a fractionated extract from TSL, caused significant cytotoxicity to osteosarcoma cells due to apoptosis. In vivo xenograft study showed that TSL-1 suppressed the growth of osteosarcoma cells at least in part by inducing apoptosis. Our results indicate that TSL-1 has potential to be a promising anti-osteosarcoma adjuvant functional plant extract.

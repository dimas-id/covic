Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first identified in Hong Kong in a regional surveillance study for Coronaviruses in 2012 and was detected for the first time in United States (US) swine in February 2014. However, it remains unknown if PDCoV had been introduced into the US prior to that time period. In the present study, 1734 clinical samples (903 cases) submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) for enteric disease diagnosis between October 2012 and December 2013 were tested retrospectively for PDCoV using a virus-specific real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR targeting conserved region of the membrane gene. PDCoV genome was first detected in a fecal sample collected on August 19th 2013 from Minnesota. Subsequently, PDCoV was observed in samples collected on August 20th and August 27th from Iowa and on August 29th from Illinois. Therefore, with available samples submitted to the ISU VDL, it can be inferred that PDCoV has been present in US swine at least since August 2013.

OBJECTIVE To compare our laparoscopic simple nephrectomy results in non-functioning inflammatory kidneys with or without renal stones. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients, who underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal nephrectomy for non-functioning kidney between June, 2010 and October, 2014 were included to study. Overall, data of 32 patients including 15 patients with renal stone (Group 1) and 17 patients without renal stone (Group 2) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Mean age was 44.4 ± 18.5 years (10-71) in group 1 and 35.2 ± 21 years (9-77) in group 2. Mean operation time was 95.0±25.9 minutes (70-175) in group 1 and 86.7 ± 15.1 minutes (70-125) in group 2. Mean estimated blood loss was found to be 64.13 ± 26.67 ml (30-120) in group 1 and 58.94 ± 24.24 ml (30-100) in group 2. Both groups had inflammatory findings in pathological analysis. There was no significant difference between groups regarding estimated blood loss, operation time, pre-operative and post-operative hemoglobin values, percent hemoglobin decrease, complications and hospitalization times (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Non-functioning kidney with or without renal stone could be operated safely with comparable complication rates and success via laparoscopy in experienced hands.

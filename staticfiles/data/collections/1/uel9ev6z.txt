OBJECTIVE To investigate the practicality of a new method using anatomical spaces for performing standard laparoscopic radical hysterectomy (LRH) without ureteral injury in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS Clinicopathological characteristics and perioperative complications were retrospectively analysed in 440 patients with stages IB1 to IIB cervical cancer. The patients were assigned to two of the following groups: LRH by our method of using anatomical landmarks (anatomical space group, n = 217) and the traditional method (traditional group, n = 223). RESULTS The mean operative duration and time of vesicouterine ligament (VUL) dissection were significantly shorter (173.87 ± 30.39 vs. 210.83 ± 44.55 minutes; 32.75 ± 7.23 vs. 43.48 ± 11.22 minutes), and blood loss was less in the anatomical space group compared with the traditional group. The rate of the intraoperative complication of ureteral injury was also significantly lower in the anatomical space group compared with the traditional group (0 vs. 5). CONCLUSIONS LRH by the anatomical method, using the axillary space and other potential spaces as anatomical landmarks, results in less blood loss and reduced ureteral injury compared with the traditional method. This method is safe and practical for separating the ureter from the VUL in patients with cervical cancer.

Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is a diagnosis of exclusion given that there is no specific diagnostic test or tool and that medical disorders can cause the same set of signs. The veterinary surgeon must first identify that signs are present, collect a full history and then perform a full physical examination and relevant diagnostic tests to rule out medical causes for the signs including blood and urine analysis, radiographs and diagnostic imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where indicated.

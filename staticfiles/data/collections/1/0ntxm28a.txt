Medicine in the United States has generally followed ethical principles espoused by Immanuel Kant where the individual patient takes priority in decision-making. With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 as a major health event, radiation oncologists in some situations need to alter the manner in which they act with individual patients. The well-being of health care workers and society as a whole needs to be considered in management decisions. During the time of a pandemic, ethics principles may be based more on a utilitarian approach that emphasizes the common good. Thus, at times treatment decisions might result in delays in initiating therapy, modifying the radiation treatment course (such as to a short course rather than a long course of therapy), and the sequence of therapies, all to minimize viral exposure. It is important that altered therapy is based as much as possible on institutional or departmental decisions and, to the extent possible, not on a case-by-case basis. However, in all situations, we need to still respect the individual's autonomy and fully inform patients of our decisions and the reasons for those decisions.

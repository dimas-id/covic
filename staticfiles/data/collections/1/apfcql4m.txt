To trace the possible route of introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the phylogenetic relationships of PEDV strains in the regions of epidemicity in the Philippines to PEDV strains that are endemic in other countries were investigated. Partial nucleotide sequences of the S1 spike gene was determined from the PEDV-positive samples and compared with S1 sequences from other countries. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PEDV strains in the Philippines segregate into two groups. Members of group 1 are related to strains from the USA, Taiwan, Japan and Canada, while those in group 2 are related to strains from China and Vietnam.

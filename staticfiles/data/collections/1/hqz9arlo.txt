BACKGROUND AND AIM Between January 2012 and June 2013, we performed laparoscopic choledocholithotomy on 10 cases of common bile duct stone disease. Laparoscopic surgery for common duct stone disease is technically demanding. Particularly, laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing and knot tying for repair of choledochotomy are the most difficult skills in this operative procedures. Barbed sutures has recently been proposed to facilitate laparoscopic suturing. This is the first report demonstrating that the barbed suture could potentially improve the efficacy of the intracorporeal repair of choledochotomy following extirpation of biliary tract stones with less time needed to suture. METHODS Consecutive 10 patients with common bile duct stones who underwent laparoscopic choledocholithotomy were enrolled in this study. Choledochotomy was closed with V-Loc sutures (15 cm V-Loc 180 sutures) for 7 patients, and a V-20 needle (26 mm, tapered) for 3 patients. RESULTS The mean choledochotomy closure time was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group (15.2 ± 1.6 min) than in the Vicryl group (23.5 ± 1.5 min). The unidirectional barbed sutures allowed surgeons to use both their hands effectively and to focus exclusively on the placement of the subsequent stitches, without the need to maintain tension on preceding stitches to prevent slippage. And also the unidirectional barbed sutures were able to distribute tension evenly along the suture line, allowing good tissue apposition. CONCLUSION The knotless unidirectional barbed sutures are a safe and effective tool for choledochotomy repair during surgery for common bile duct stones.

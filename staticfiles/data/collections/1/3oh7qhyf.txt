OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features of the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), so as to provide basis for clinical diagnosis. METHODS: The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiologic data of 23 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Xinyang City from January 22nd to January 29th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There was 23 patients with COVID-19, with 15 men and 8 women, and the median age was 46.0 (40.5, 52.0) years old (ranged from 27 years old to 80 years old). Nine patients had basic disease (39.1%), including hypertension (17.4%), cardiovascular diseases (17.4%), diabetes (8.7%), hypothyroidism (4.3%) and past history of tuberculosis (4.3%). All the 23 patients had contact history in Wuhan area or with confirmed cases. Clinical symptoms included fever (100%), cough (69.6%), expectoration (43.5%), myalgia (26.1%), headache (17.4%) and dyspnea (17.4%), and the less common symptom was diarrhea (4.3%). Blood routine tests showed leukocytopenia in 11 patients (47.8%), normal leukocyte counts in 10 patients (43.5%), and leukocytosis in 2 patients (8.7%); lymphopenia was found in 13 patients (56.5%). All 23 patients had different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT, with 7 patients (30.4%) on one side and 16 patients (69.6%) on both sides. There were 19 mild patients, 4 severe patients, and no critical or death case. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (17.4%). No patient was reported with liver, kidney or heart dysfunction or secondary infection. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic history of contact, fever, pneumonia signs of chest CT, normal or decreased count of leukocyte and lymphopenia are the clinical basis for diagnosis of COVID-19. However, at present, the treatment of patients has not been completed, and the effective treatment strategy and final prognosis are unclear.

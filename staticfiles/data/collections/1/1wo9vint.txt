Laparoscopy is an established method for the treatment of numerous surgical conditions. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is a novel surgical technique that uses the natural orifices of the human body as entrances to the abdominal cavity. An alternative concept of minimally invasive approach to the abdominal cavity is to insert all the laparoscopic instruments through ports using a single small incision on the abdominal wall. A suggested name for this technique is laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). Considering the technical difficulties in NOTES and LESS and the progress in informatics and robotics, the use of robots seems ideal. The aim of this study is to investigate if there is at present, a realistic possibility of using miniature robots in NOTES or LESS in daily clinical practice. An up-to-date review on in vivo surgical miniature robots is made. A Web-based research of the English literature up to March 2013 using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar as search engines was performed. The development of in vivo miniature robots for use in NOTES or LESS is a reality with great advancements, potential advantages, and possible application in minimally invasive surgery in the future. However, true totally NOTES or LESS procedures on humans using miniature robots either solely or as assistance, remain a dream at present.

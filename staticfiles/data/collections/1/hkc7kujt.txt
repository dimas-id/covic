Fast and accurate measurement of core body temperature is crucial for accidental hypothermia treatment. We have developed a novel light and small adapter to the headset jack of a mobile phone based on Android. It has been applied to measure temperature and set up automatic notifications (e.g. Global Positioning System coordinates to emergency services dispatcher, ECMO coordinator). Its validity was confirmed in comparison with Vital Signs Monitor Spacelabs Healthcare Elance 93300 as a reference method, in a series of 260 measurements in the temperature range of 10-42 °C. Measurement repeatability was verified in a battery of 600 measurements (i.e. 100 readings at three points of 10, 25, 42 °C for both esophageal and tympanic catheters). Inter-method difference of ≤0.5 °C was found for 98.5% for esophageal catheter and 100% for tympanic catheter measurements, with concordance correlation coefficient of 0.99 for both. The readings were almost completely repeatable with water bath measurements (difference of ≤0.5 °C in 10 °C: 100% for both catheters; in 25 °C: 99% for esophageal catheter and 100% tympanic catheter; in 42 °C: 100% for both catheters). This lightweight adapter attached to smartphone and standard disposable probes is a promising tool to be applied on-site for temperature measurement in patients at risk of hypothermia.

Histoplasmosis causes a wide spectrum of clinical illness, including disseminated infection in the immunocompromised. We report a case of pulmonary histoplasmosis in an allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient and review the literature on this topic. Histoplasmosis in this patient population is uncommon, but it is associated with poor outcome.

A variety of peptides can be self-assembled, i.e. self-organized spontaneously, into large and complex hierarchical structures, reproducibly by regulating a range of parameters that can be environment driven, process driven, or peptide driven. These supramolecular peptide aggregates yield different shapes and structures like nanofibers, nanotubes, nanobelts, nanowires, nanotapes, and micelles. These peptide nanostructures represent a category of materials that bridge biotechnology and nanotechnology and are found suitable not only for biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery but also in nanoelectronics.

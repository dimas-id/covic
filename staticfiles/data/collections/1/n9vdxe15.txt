BACKGROUND While previous studies suggest laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) as a reasonable treatment approach to address weight loss failure after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), data focusing on long-term outcomes are still lacking. The purpose of this study was to evaluate weight and comorbidity outcomes comparing revisional LRYGB (rLRYGB) with primary LRYGB (pLRYGB). METHODS Retrospective single-centre case-matched analysis was conducted at a bariatric tertiary referral centre. Between January 2009 and July 2013, 239 patients were entered into a prospective database, and 32 patients undergoing rLRYGB (cases) were matched with 32 patients undergoing pLRYGB (controls) for sex, age and BMI. The end point was data at 3 years of follow-up. Thirty-one patients (12.9%) were lost to follow-up during the study period. RESULTS There were no significant differences in patient demographics or median BMI (kg/m2) for pLRYGB or rLRYGB (42.8 ± 12.1 vs. 42.3 ± 11.5, respectively; p = 0.748). Coexisting comorbidities were rated similarly in both groups. At 3 years, the percentage of excess weight loss (74.4 ± 23.3 vs 52.0 ± 26, respectively; p = 0.007) was higher for pLRYGB than rLRYGB, while similar improvements of coexisting comorbidities could be observed. CONCLUSION rLRYGB is a feasible and practical surgical approach that allows effective weight loss at 3 years of follow-up and alleviates refractory reflux symptoms. Although weight loss is lower compared to pLRYGB, resolution or improvement of coexisting comorbidities appears similar. Therefore, rLRYGB seems to be a reliable procedure to address failure after LSG.

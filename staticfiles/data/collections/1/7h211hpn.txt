Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has since spread to more than 200 other countries at the time of writing. In light of this situation, the Japanese Government declared a state of emergency in seven regions of Japan on the April 7, 2020 under the provisions of the law. The medical care delivery system has been under pressure. Although various surgical societies have published guidelines on which to base their surgical decisions, it is not clear how general anesthesia has been performed and will be performed in Japan. Social networks such as Twitter are becoming a part of society, as various information is accumulated on the web. One of the services provided by Twitter is a voting function-Twitter Polls-through which anonymous surveys can be conducted. We analyzed the results of a series of surveys on Twitter on the status of operating restrictions using a mathematical model, and public data provided by the Japanese Government were used to estimate the current and future changes in the number of general anesthesia performed in Japan. The number of general anesthesia was estimated as 2.77*104 cases per week on 2nd May 2020 and 0.68*104 cases in 24 weeks.

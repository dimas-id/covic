Longitudinal sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has been validated for the treatment of morbid obesity. However, treatment failures can appear several months after SG. Additional malabsorptive surgery is generally recommended in such cases. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of repeat SG (re-SG) relative to first-line SG. This was a retrospective study included 15 patients underwent re-SG after failure of first-line SG (i.e. University Hospital, France; Public Practice). These patients were matched (for age, gender, body mass index and comorbidities) 1:2 with 30 patients having undergone first-line SG. The efficacy criteria comprised intra-operative data and postoperative data. The overall study population comprised 45 patients. The re-SG and first-line SG groups did not differ significantly in terms of median age (p = NS). The median BMI was similar in the two groups (43 kg/m(2) vs. 42.3 kg/m(2), p = NS). The two groups were similar in terms of the prevalence of comorbidities. The mean operating time was longer in the re-SG group (116 vs. 86 min; p â‰¤ 0.01). The postoperative complication rate was twice as high in the re-SG group (p = 0.31). Two patients in the re-SG group developed a gastric fistula (p = 0.25) and one of the latter died. At 12 months, the Excess Weight Loss was 66% (re-SG group) and 77% (first-line SG group) (p = 0.05). Re-SG is feasible but appears to be associated with a greater risk of complications. Nevertheless, re-SG can produce results (in terms of weight loss), equivalent to those obtained after first-line SG.

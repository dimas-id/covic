Post-infectious hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is caused by specific pathogens in patients with no identifiable HUS-associated genetic mutation or autoantibody. The majority of episodes is due to infections by Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC). This chapter reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of STEC-HUS, including bacterial-derived factors and host responses. STEC disease is characterized by hematological (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), renal (acute kidney injury) and extrarenal organ involvement. Clinicians should always strive for an etiological diagnosis through the microbiological or molecular identification of Stx-producing bacteria and Stx or, if negative, serological assays. Treatment of STEC-HUS is supportive; more investigations are needed to evaluate the efficacy of putative preventive and therapeutic measures, such as non-phage-inducing antibiotics, volume expansion and anti-complement agents. The outcome of STEC-HUS is generally favorable, but chronic kidney disease, permanent extrarenal, mainly cerebral complication and death (in less than 5 %) occur and long-term follow-up is recommended. The remainder of this chapter highlights rarer forms of (post-infectious) HUS due to S. dysenteriae, S. pneumoniae, influenza A and HIV and discusses potential interactions between these pathogens and the complement system.

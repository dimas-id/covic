The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing schools, universities and learning and development professionals to shift rapidly from in-person to online learning. It made providing of an effective e-learning contents more important. Consequently, the development of e-learning products and provision of e-learning opportunities is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of education and training. The growth of e-learning application is accelerating through both offline and online system. These innovative systems are changing the face of learning as we know it. However, what is known about these innovative approaches for learning and training has been limited by the shortage of scientifically evaluation. This study aims to assess the impact of using interactive instructions on e-learning to improve effectiveness of a programming course. This study develops a questionnaire based on usability evaluation method for an e-learning system. The method extends the current practice by focusing not only on cognitive but also affective considerations that may influence e-learning usability. This paper presents findings from a study of the impact of the learning systems. The study also describes designing evaluation sheet, data collection and analysis strategies of a case study on the evaluation of the e-learning system implemented for Programming Course in Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU), Japan.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: the ability of viruses to infect host cells is dependent on several factors including the availability of cell-surface receptors, antiviral state of cells, and presence of host factors needed for viral replication. Here we review findings from in vitro and in vivo studies using mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) that have identified an intricate group of molecules and mechanisms used by the virus to attach and enter cells. RECENT FINDINGS: recent findings provide an improved mechanistic understanding of reovirus cell entry. Of special note is the identification of a cellular mediator of cell entry in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, the effect of cell entry on the outcome of infection and cytopathic effects on the host cell, and an improved understanding of the components that promote viral penetration of cellular membranes. SUMMARY: a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between host and viral factors has enhanced our view of how viruses usurp cellular processes during infection.

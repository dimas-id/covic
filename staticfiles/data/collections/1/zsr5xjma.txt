Abstract Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multimeric protein complexes mimicking the organization of native viruses but lack the viral genome. VLPs therefore constitute a safe and effective approach for the induction of neutralizing antibodies to surface proteins. Influenza VLPs have recently been developed as a new generation of non-egg based cell culture-derived vaccine candidates against influenza infection. FluBock, a recombinant trivalent hemagglutinin (rHA) vaccine produced in insect cell culture using the baculovirus expression system, provides an attractive alternative to classical inactivated influenza vaccines. The highly purified protein vaccine, administered with a three-fold higher antigen content (135 Î¼g), is well tolerated and results in stronger immunogenicity, a long lasting immune response and provides cross-protection against drift influenza viruses.

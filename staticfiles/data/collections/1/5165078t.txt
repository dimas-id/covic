Abstract Fueled by globalization and human behavior, communicable diseases pose a serious threat to humankind despite unparalleled technological advances. New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging, while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic locationâ€”where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases, including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis, as well as new diseases such as Ebola, Zika, and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases. Because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries, global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.

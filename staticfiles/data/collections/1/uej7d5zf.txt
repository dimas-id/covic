In addition to classical virus isolation in cell culture, the molecular detection of new virus variants by PCR techniques allows broader epidemiological insights into the world of viral pathogens. For the detection of hantaviruses–zoonotic viruses leading to fever and organ failure in humans–we developed a genus-wide nested RT-PCR format, which enables the discovery of new members within this virus genus. The methodological approach allowed the demonstration of first hantaviruses from Africa and revealed new hantavirus reservoir hosts, as shrews, moles, and bats.

Since the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia(NCP), hospitals have taken the fight against the virus as its own responsibility, and keep standing in the front line of epidemic prevention and control. The continuous input of anti-epidemic forces in hospitals also brings challenges to the medical supplies support, including the management of protective supplies and the maintenance of medical equipment. In the face of increasing security pressure, the medical materials support team broke the game on multiple fronts. Firstly, the team implements active material procurement strategy, sets material distribution priority according to risk level, releases materials uniformly based on stock and use, and implements traceability management of donated materials to ensure material supply. Secondly, centralized allocation management of equipment, emergency installation, advanced maintenance and emergency maintenance work is effectively completed. Thirdly, disinfection strategies for items and equipment are developed safely and effectively with the aid of disinfection equipment functions. At last, personnel management and training have been strengthened. These measures have provided strong support for the orderly prevention and control of the epidemic.

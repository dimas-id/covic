If the COVID‐19 pandemic has already taught us anything, it is that policymakers, experts and public managers need to be capable of interpreting comparative data on their government's performance in a meaningful way. Simultaneously, they are confronted with different data sources (and measurements) surrounding COVID‐19 without necessarily having the tools to assess these sources strategically. Due to the speed with which decisions are required and the different data sources, it can be challenging for any policymaker, expert or public manager to make sense of how COVID‐19 has an impact, especially from a comparative perspective. Starting from the question “How can we benchmark COVID‐19 performance data across countries?”, this article presents important indicators, measurements, and their strengths and weaknesses, and concludes with practical recommendations. These include a focus on measurement equivalence, systems thinking, spatial and temporal thinking, multilevel governance and multimethod designs. This article is protected by copyright.

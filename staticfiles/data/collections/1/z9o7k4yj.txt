The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed many individuals in need of critical care, with a high proportion of hospitalized patients being admitted to intensive care units (ICU) to treat acute outcomes of COVID-19 (e.g., respiratory failure via mechanical ventilation). The ICU is known to be a setting where individuals are at a high risk of experiencing significant psychological difficulties, and patients with COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to such experiences, which can impact their recovery process (e.g., postintensive care syndrome). This article seeks to highlight the intersection between critical care related to trauma and COVID-19 and point providers toward opportunities for anticipating and managing secondary effects in effort to promote psychological adaptation.

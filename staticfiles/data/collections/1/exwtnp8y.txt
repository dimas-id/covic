Structured Abstract Objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems and disrupted routine care internationally. Healthcare workers face disruption to their work routines and professional development, as well as an elevated risk of infection and morbidity. We sought to establish the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the wellbeing, practice and progression of all trainees in cardiothoracic surgery in the United Kingdom. Methods A 31-item questionnaire was designed, validated, and disseminated via email and an instant-messaging platform. Results 76 (of 118, 64%) cardiothoracic surgical trainees responded, representing all training grades and programmes nationally. 48 (63%) and 24 (32%) were concerned about their physical and mental health respectively. 25 (33%) had taken time off work due to Covid-19. 65 (86%) had treated Covid-19 patients, 36 of whom (55%) were wearing satisfactory personal protective equipment at the time. 41 (54%) remain concerned about PPE provision at their institution. 42 (55%) had been redeployed to cover other specialties. 23 (30%) had encountered ethical dilemmas related to care of patients. There was a significant impact on time spent in outpatient clinics (44% reduction), multidisciplinary team meetings (79% reduction) and operating theatres (78% reduction). 67 (88%) of respondents were concerned about the impact on their training, and 54 (71%) felt that the deviation may require an extension in their planned training time. Conclusions The duration and impact of the current pandemic is, as yet, uncertain. Timely sharing of experiences, concerns and expectations will inform healthcare and education policy, and influence practice in the pandemic era and beyond.

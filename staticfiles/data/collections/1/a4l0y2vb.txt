Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was first recognized in North America in April 2013 and has since caused devastating disease. The objective of this study was to characterize disease and viral detection associated with an original North American PEDV isolate inoculated in neonatal piglets. Thirty-six 1-day-old cesarean-derived and colostrum-deprived piglets were randomly assigned to the control (n = 16) or challenged group (n = 20); the latter were orogastrically inoculated with 1 ml of US/Iowa/18984/2013 PEDV isolate titered at 1 Ã— 10(3) plaque-forming units per milliliter. Rectal swabs were collected from all piglets prior to inoculation and every 12 hours postinoculation (hpi) thereafter, with 4 control and 5 challenged piglets euthanized at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. One piglet had a positive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction test on rectal swab at 12 hpi, and all remaining piglets were positive thereafter, with highest viral quantities detected at 24 and 36 hpi. Diarrhea was evident in 30% and 100% of challenged piglets at 18 and 24 hpi, respectively. Viral antigen was detected in enterocytes by immunohistochemistry in the duodenum and ileum of piglets euthanized at 12 hpi and was apparent throughout the small intestine of all piglets thereafter, with villus height:crypt depth ratios consistently below 4:1. Viremia was confirmed in 18 of 20 pigs at euthanasia. Clinical disease was severe and developed rapidly following infection with an original North American PEDV isolate, with lesions, viremia, and antigen detection possible by 12 hpi.

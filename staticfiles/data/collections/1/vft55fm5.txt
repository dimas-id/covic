The One Health concept is gathering momentum and, over the next 12 months, Veterinary Record will be publishing a series of articles to help encourage that process. Written by specialists in a range of fields, the articles will consider the meaning of One Health, the interactions between animal and human health and how a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach could help to solve emerging global problems. To set the scene, Paul Gibbs outlines the recent history of One Health, discusses current challenges and muses on what the future might hold.

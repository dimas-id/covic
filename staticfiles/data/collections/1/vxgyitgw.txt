OBJECTIVE To present a case of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) nephroureterectomy (NUx), a type of embroyonic natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery, which is one of the recent innovations in the era of laparoscopy, in a child. METHODS A 10-year-old girl underwent left nephroureterectomy by LESS due to end-stage reflux nephropathy on December 25, 2008. The surgery is performed transperitoneally, through a 2-cm semicircular incision in the left inner curve of the umbilicus using three 5-mm trocars. NUx with LESS was performed duplicating standard laparoscopic steps with the help of flexible and straight laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS Operation time was 140 minutes and the blood loss was minimal. There was no intraoperative or postoperative complication. The patient was discharged at the 24th postoperative hour. The postoperative cosmetic result was excellent as the incision scar was hidden inside the belly button. CONCLUSIONS NUx with LESS is a feasible technique with the advantages of less pain, shortened convalescence, improved cosmesis, and absence of wound complications in children. However, clear indications of LESS in children remain to be clarified.

Introduction. Laparoscopic greater curvature plication is an operation that is gaining ground in the treatment of morbid obesity, as it appears to replicate the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with fewer complications. Aim. Review of current literature, especially results on weight loss and complications. Method. 11 (eleven) published articles on laparoscopic gastric plication, of which 1 preclinical study, 8 prospective studies for a total of 521 patients and 2 case reports of unusual complications. Results. Reported Paracentage of EWL in all studies is comparable to Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (around 50% in 6 months, 60-65% in 12 months, 60-65% in 24 months) and total complication rate is at 15,1% with minor complications in 10,7%, major complications in 4,4%. Reoperation rate was 3%, conversion rate was 0,2%, and mortality was zero. Conclusion. Current literature on gastric plication and its modifications is limited and sketchy at times. Low cost, short hospital stay, absence of prosthetic material, and reversibility make it an attractive option. Initial data show that LGCP is effective for short- and medium-term weight loss, complication and reoperation rates are low, and GERD symptoms are unaffected. More data is required, and randomized control trials must be completed in order to reach safe conclusions.

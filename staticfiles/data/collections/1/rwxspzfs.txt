Outlined in this review is the concept of population proteomics, its aspects, enabling approaches, and significance in understanding proteins' roles in physiological processes and diseases. Population proteomics addresses the need for individual assessment of proteins across large populations to delineate the existence of structural variations, determine their frequency, and explore the association of the modifications with specific diseases. Besides the basic concepts and underlying reasons for such protein diversity studies, also reviewed here are the results of two fundamental studies that investigated human plasma protein diversity across the healthy population in the United States. Such studies of protein diversity are needed to map all the post-expression protein modifications and determine the wild-type protein profiles, similar to the human diversity studies at the genome level that have helped redefine the "normal" human genome.

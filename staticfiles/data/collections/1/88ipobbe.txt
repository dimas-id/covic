We herein report the first case of a single-incision laparoscopic access (SILA) adrenalectomy in Japan. A 74-year-old woman who was a hepatitis B virus carrier was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal screening result during a routine health checkup. Abdominal computed tomography and an endocrinologic workup revealed a 2-cm left adrenal tumor with primary aldosteronism. We prioritized the safety of the SILA adrenalectomy by choosing a left lower abdominal approach. A SILS port was inserted through a 2.5-cm incision. An ultrasonic coagulator was the main tool used during the surgical procedure. The duration of the surgery was 105 min and the blood loss was 1 ml. This result was comparable to that of a conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Based on our experience, an SILA adrenalectomy is thus considered to be feasible and safe, with better cosmetic results and a greater overall patient satisfaction than that of a conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. However, further studies will be necessary before the universal adoption of this new technique can be considered.

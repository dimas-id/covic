Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has been enthusiastically used as a less-invasive diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure in recent years. VATS results in considerably less postoperative pain than traditional thoracotomy incisions. The current trend is to reduce the number of ports and minimize the length of incisions to further reduce postoperative pain, chest wall paresthesia, and length of hospitalization. Although several accounts of reduced port surgery, such as single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), have been reported, there are few descriptions of single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) using a thin puncture device for a variety of diseases. Herein, we describe a minimally invasive SITS technique using a thin puncture device.

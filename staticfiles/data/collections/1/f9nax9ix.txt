OBJECTIVE The purposes of this article are to review the current management of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) based on the 2012 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and to describe the role of imaging in a multidisciplinary approach. CONCLUSION The management of GEP-NETs has become complex, requiring a multidisciplinary approach. The World Health Organization classification of GEP-NETs has been revised; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved molecular targeted agents (sunitinib, everolimus) for the treatment of pancreatic NETs; and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines have been updated.

We report on 17 patients with massive abductor avulsions after total hip arthroplasty (THA) treated with medialization of the acetabular component and tensor fascia lata (TFL) reconstruction. All patients had severe limp, positive Trendelenburg sign, and avulsion of the abductor insertion confirmed on MRI. Mean age was 69 years (range, 50-83 years), and mean follow-up period was 36 months (range, 18-78 months). After surgery, 9 patients had no limp (47%), 8 patients had a mild limp, and abductor power improved from mean 2.5/5 to mean 3.8 (P < 0.0001). At latest follow-up, the Harris Hip Score was excellent in 6 hips (37%), good in 7 (43%) hips, and fair or poor in 3 (23%). Two patients with mild limp were not satisfied with their procedure.

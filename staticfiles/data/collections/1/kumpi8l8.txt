BACKGROUND: Approximately 4.5% of the population live with serious mental illness (SMI), a term referring to mental health disorders that are chronic, impair function, and require ongoing treatment. People living with SMI are at risk of premature mortality relative to people without SMI. Chronic medical illnesses contribute significantly to mortality among individuals with SMI. The standard of care for individuals with serious medical illnesses includes palliative care. However, the provision of palliative care has not been operationalized for individuals with SMI. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: This narrative review presents existing epidemiologic data on end-of-life (EOL) care and palliative care for individuals with comorbid serious medical illness and SMI. Challenges in the care of such patients are discussed. The role of the consultation-liaison psychiatrist in providing EOL care for individuals with SMI is delineated with an eye towards redressing disparities. RESULTS: Individuals with SMI are at risk of sub-optimal end-of-life care. Patient, clinician, and system-level factors all contribute to disparities including decreased access to palliative care, uneven continued engagement with mental health services, and low rates of advance care planning. CL psychiatrists can use their expertise at the intersection of medicine and psychiatry to address such disparities by (1) correcting misassumptions, (2) promoting advance care planning, (3) engaging long-term caregivers, (4) recognizing social needs, (5) ensuring ongoing access to psychiatric treatment, and (6) addressing suffering. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant disparities in the end-of-life care of individuals with SMI. CL psychiatrists have expertise to ally with medical providers and redress these disparities.

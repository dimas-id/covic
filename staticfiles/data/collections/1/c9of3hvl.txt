OBJECTIVE To clone, express and purify nucleocapsid protein from SARS coronavirus PUMC2 strain. METHODS According to the published SARS coronavirus genome sequences, the full length cDNA of N protein from SARS coronavirus PUMC2 strain was cloned by RT-PCR and the cDNA was cloned into the pET32a expression vector. The recombinant N protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and purified by Ni(2+)-NTA. RESULTS Prokaryoticly expressed and purified N protein of SARS coronavirus PUMC2 strain was obtained. CONCLUSIONS The SARS coronavirus recombinant N protein obtained by genetic engineering methods can be used for further functional study of SARS coronavirus N protein.

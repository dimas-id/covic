Using a category dual to finite [Formula: see text]-algebras and their homomorphisms, in this paper we characterise the structure of the automorphism group of any given finite [Formula: see text]-algebra. Further, we specialise our result to the case of the variety generated by the k-element [Formula: see text]-algebra, for each [Formula: see text].

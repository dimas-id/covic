Abstract Three experiments were conducted with turkeys to determine the influence of delayed access to feed and water on the development of the digestive system. In all experiments, poults were randomly assigned to three placement times, 6, 30, and 54 h posthatch. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were terminated when poults were 10, 28, and 14 d old, respectively. In Experiment 1, six poults per treatment were sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. In Experiment 2, 12 poults per treatment were sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 28. The objective of Experiment 3 was to determine the effect of delayed placement on dietary MEn. Delaying access to feed and water for 54 h adversely affected BW through 10, 28, and 14 d of age in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < or = 0.01). Delayed access to feed and water for 54 h decreased the absolute weights of the small intestine and pancreas and reduced lengths of the small intestine through 5 d posthatch (P < or = 0.05). The relative weights of the small intestine and proventriculus were reduced by delayed access to nourishment through 4 d posthatch. Poults placed on feed at 54 h posthatch had decreased pancreatic amylase activity (P < or = 0.05) at 3 and 4 d, and trypsin activities were depressed at 3 d posthatch (P < or = 0.05). In Experiment 3, dietary MEn value determined at 4 d of age with poults placed 54 h posthatch was less (P < or = 0.07) than the MEn value obtained with poults placed at 6 h posthatch. A 54-h delay in access to feed and water generally delayed development of the digestive system, impaired nutrient utilization, and reduced BW.

OBJECTIVES: The corona disease (COVID-19) is developing into one of the greatest challenges for healthcare professionals around the world. In this article, we report the detailed actions taken in the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Periodontology, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU), Munich, Germany, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: After a joint on-site inspection of the dental clinic with the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene, existing clinical and hygiene protocols were adapted for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A comprehensive summary of the preparation of the facilities as well as pre- treatment, treatment and posttreatment protocols are described and arising problems are being discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of rigorous hygiene and treatment protocols as well as a sufficient supply of PPE for dental offices and hospitals is highlighted. The measures reported may be subject to change due to the dynamics of the pandemic. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The modes of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (e.g., droplets, aerosols, and fomites) can pose a risk for dental healthcare professionals and patients alike. The presented measures may guide dental faculties and dental practices during the early stage of the COVID-19 crisis.

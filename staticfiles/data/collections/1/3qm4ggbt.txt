We report a combined laparoscopic and open technique for extralevator abdominal perineal excision of the rectum. The key steps are a laparoscopic rectal dissection limited distally by the coccyx. The open, prone, perineal dissection affords excellent views and allows a cylindrical specimen to be obtained. The resulting perineal defect is closed by a biological mesh. Extralevator abdominal perineal excision of the rectum offers a superior oncological specimen with reduced circumferential resection margin involvement compared to traditional techniques. Combined with a laparoscopic approach, this also has the potential to improve postoperative recovery and reduce morbidity.

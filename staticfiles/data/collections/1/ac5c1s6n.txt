There were three events of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China from 2003 to 2004. Starting from 2002, we are also aware of the increasing alert of an avian flu pandemic. Epidemics of SARS and avian flu have posed huge threats to social stability, economic prosperity and human health in this country. What we have experienced during SARS outbreaks has great implications for the protection of people against a resurgence of SARS and potential attacks of high-pathogenic avian flu viruses. To that end, China has been preparing to contain future pandemics by applying lessons learnt from SARS.

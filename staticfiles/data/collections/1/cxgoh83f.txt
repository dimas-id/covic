BACKGROUND: Preoperative assessment of geriatric-specific determinants of health may enhance perioperative risk stratification among elderly patients. This study examines effects of geriatric-specific variables on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective major abdominal operations. METHODS: Patients included in the ACS NSQIP pilot Geriatric Surgery Research File program who underwent elective pancreatic, liver, and colorectal operations between 2014 and 2016 were examined. Multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate associations between patient-specific geriatric variables and risk of death, morbidity, readmission, and discharge destination. RESULTS: A total of 4165 patients were included. Patients ≥85 years were more likely to die, experience postoperative morbidity, and be discharged to a facility (all p ≤ 0.039) than younger patients. Preoperatively, patients ≥85 years were more likely to use a mobility aid, have a prior fall, have consent signed by a surrogate, and to live alone at home prior to operation (all p < 0.001). After adjustment for ACS NSQIP-estimated probabilities of morbidity or mortality, no geriatric-specific preoperative risk factors were significantly associated with increased risk of death or complications in any age group (all p > 0.055). Patients 75–84 and ≥85 years were more likely to be discharged to facility (OR 2.33 and 4.75, respectively, both p < 0.001) compared to patients 65–74 years. All geriatric-specific variables: use of mobility aid, living alone, consent signed by a surrogate, and fall history, were significantly associated with discharge to a facility (all p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for comorbid conditions, geriatric-specific variables are not associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity among elderly patients; however, geriatric-specific variables are significantly associated with discharge to a facility.

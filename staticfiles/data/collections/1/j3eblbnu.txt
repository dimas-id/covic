The objective of this study was to investigate sero-epidemiological aspects of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mh), influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and Aujeszky disease virus (ADV) in fattening pigs from 150 randomly selected farrow-to-finish pig herds. Different herd factors were examined as potential risk indicators for the percentage of pigs with antibodies against the 4 pathogens. The median within-herd seroprevalences of the pathogens were: Mh 76%, H1N1 100%, H3N2 40% and ADV 53%. There was a positive association between the seroprevalences of both influenza viruses, and a negative association between the seroprevalences of ADV and H1N1. The percentage of pigs seropositive for Mh increased with the purchase of gilts and with the season (slaughter date in March-April). The within-herd seroprevalences of both influenza viruses were higher in the case of a higher density of pig herds in the municipality. A higher number of fattening pigs per pen additionally increased the risk of being seropositive for H3N2. The percentage of pigs with anti-gE-antibodies against the wild type ADV increased with higher airspace stocking density in the finishing unit, increasing herd size, increasing number of pig herds in the municipality and slaughter date in March-April. Increased seroprevalences for these 4 respiratory pathogens were mostly associated with pig density in the herd and its vicinity, the winter period, and with the purchase of gilts. Purchase of gilts, number of fattening pigs per pen and airspace stocking density are risk factors that can be managed directly by farmers striving to attain a high respiratory health status of pigs.

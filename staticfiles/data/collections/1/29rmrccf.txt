Seizures have been reported frequently in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) but have not been studied in detail in association with this disease. The purpose of this study was to perform a retrospective analysis of neurological signs in a population of 55 cats with a histopathologically confirmed neurological form of FIP. Seizure patterns were determined and it was attempted to relate occurrence of seizures with age, breed, sex and neuropathological features. Fourteen cats had seizure(s), while 41 cats had no history of seizure(s). Generalised tonicâ€“clonic seizures were seen in nine cats; and complex focal seizures were observed in four patients. The exact type of seizure could not be determined in one cat. Status epilepticus was observed in one patient but seizure clusters were not encountered. Occurrence of seizures was not related to age, sex, breed or intensity of the inflammation in the central nervous system. However, seizures were significantly more frequent in animals with marked extension of the inflammatory lesions to the forebrain (P =0.038). Thus, the occurrence of seizures in FIP indicates extensive brain damage and can, therefore, be considered to be an unfavourable prognostic sign.

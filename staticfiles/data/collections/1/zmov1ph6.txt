BACKGROUND There is limited worldwide experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in pregnancy. We present a case of SARS complicating pregnancy in the third trimester, with outcome data on both the mother and baby. CASE A 33-year-old gravida 2 para 1 fulfilling the World Health Organization case definition for probable SARS was admitted to our institution at 31 weeks of gestation with fever, a dry cough, and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient was previously healthy and acquired SARS from close contact with an infected family member. Convalescent serology results were positive for antibodies to coronavirus. She stayed in hospital for 21 days and did not require intensive care admission or ventilatory support. Labor occurred spontaneously at term, and a healthy female baby was delivered with no evidence of infection. CONCLUSION Severe acute respiratory syndrome in pregnancy is a potentially life-threatening illness with complicated management issues. Hospitalization and care by a multidisciplinary team may optimize chances for a good outcome.

The complete nucleotide sequences of three chimpanzee polyomavirus genetic variants were determined. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the viruses form two different genotypes of ChPyV. Comparison with other primate polyomaviruses revealed a putative agnogene, and an unusually long VP1 open reading frame. The transcriptional control regions (TCR) of the viruses were extremely short (155 nucleotides), and highly conserved amongst the genotypes. Analysis of the TCR from different chimpanzee subspecies, and from a series of tissues from five individuals confirmed its genetic stability, and also indicates that double-infections with different genotypes can occur.

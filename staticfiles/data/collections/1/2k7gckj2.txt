Objective: To obtain the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens in Guangdong Province with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and analyze the factors influencing sequencing. Methods: Eight upper and lower respiratory tract specimens were collected from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province in January 2020. RNA library construction was used to obtain the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. A bio-informatics software package (CLC Genomics Workbench 12.0) was used to analyze and compare the genomic sequences. Results: Five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from the eight specimens and two were obtained from lower respiratory tract specimens. The nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV-2 was 97.74%-99.90%. The Ct values were lower, while the sequencing depth, coverage, relative abundance and genome integrity were higher in sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 in lower respiratory tract specimens. Conclusions: The low Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples was good for sequencing.

The availability of a vast array of recombinant and synthetic IMMUNOMODULATORS is a significant milestone toward the development of effective therapies for infectious diseases. This is evinced by licensing of several recombinant human CYTOKINES, including COLONY-STIMULATING FACTORS, INTERLEUKINS, INTERFERONS and erythropoietin, for clinical use in patients. Diverse combinations with INTERFERONS and other CYTOKINES for the treatment of various infections have been proposed. Others, including various CHEMOKINES, synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and glucans, are extensively being investigated in clinical and preclinical studies. Considerable advances have been made on compounds exhibiting CYTOKINE inhibitory properties useful for new treatments of infectious and inflammatory diseases. Many of the major developments and current trends are highlighted in this review. Novel strategies based on the engineering of CYTOKINES and inhibitors are poised to revolutionize therapeutic options contingent upon scientific evidence rather than dictates of discursive empiricism in the coming decades.

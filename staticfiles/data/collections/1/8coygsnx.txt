BACKGROUND A highly positive intraoperative fluid balance should be prevented as it negatively impacts patient outcome. Analysis of volume-kinetics has identified an increase in interstitial fluid volume after crystalloid fluid loading during isoflurane anesthesia. Isoflurane has also been associated with postoperative hypoxemia and may be associated with an increase in alveolar epithelial permeability, edema formation, and hindered oxygen exchange. In this article, the authors compare fluid extravasation rates before and during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with isoflurane- versus propofol-based anesthesia. METHODS Fourteen pigs underwent 2 h of tepid CPB with propofol (P-group; n = 7) or isoflurane anesthesia (I-group; n = 7). Fluid requirements, plasma volume, colloid osmotic pressures in plasma and interstitial fluid, hematocrit levels, and total tissue water content were recorded, and fluid extravasation rates calculated. RESULTS Fluid extravasation rates increased in the I-group from the pre-CPB level of 0.27 (0.13) to 0.92 (0.36) ml·kg·min, but remained essentially unchanged in the P-group with significant between-group differences during CPB (pb = 0.002). The results are supported by corresponding changes in interstitial colloid osmotic pressure and total tissue water content. CONCLUSIONS During CPB, isoflurane, in contrast to propofol, significantly contributes to a general increase in fluid shifts from the intravascular to the interstitial space with edema formation and a possible negative impact on postoperative organ function.

The COVID-19 healthcare crisis and the resulting “stay-at-home” orders have created many obstacles for physicians across disciplines who are trying to maintain the standard of care This is particularly true for epilepsy patients with uncontrolled seizures who often require frequent ambulatory visits, ancillary testing, and even inpatient monitoring The American Epilepsy Society statement on COVID-19 advises epilepsy centers to utilize remote care options such as telephone, telehealth, and electronic health record messaging to manage their patients, a treatment model that is largely new to epilepsy care The urgent move to a remote care model is underscored by the International League Against Epilepsy, which advised physicians to counsel patients that they could experience an increase in seizures due to decreased access to antiepileptic medications (AEDs) and increased stress during COVID-19 Indeed, viral infection has been hypothesized to be one of the important causative factors of febrile seizures,1 though the risk of seizures due to COVID-19 and its related fevers remain debated 2 Novel remote-care options are thus needed during a crisis like this to ensure the best care possible for epilepsy patients [truncated]

Pulmonary function variables (forced expiratory flows and vital capacity, static lung volume, alveolar N(2) slopes closing volume and closing capacity) were compared in a group of 10–16 year old children with (n=65) and without (n=440) symptoms or signs of mild acute respiratory infection (‘common cold’). Symptomatic children had a significant impairment of forced expiratory vital capacity and flows, with no change In static volumes, alveolar N(2) slopes and closing volumes. The effect was present only In boys (in whom RV/TLC and phase III slope were borderline abnormal), was more evident in older children (13 to 16 years) and was independent of the smoking habits or the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms. The results are in favour of a predominant involvement of upper airways, but signs of lower airways dysfunction are present in boys and in children 13 to 16 years old.

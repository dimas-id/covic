The effects of hyperimmune cow colostrum (HCC) on experimentally induced porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) were investigated in piglets. In experiment 1, four 2-day-old piglets fed HCC containing an antibody titer of 1:512 and another four piglets fed unimmune cow colostrum (UCC) were orally inoculated with 10LD50 of PED virus. The piglets were given colostrum three times a day at 4 hr intervals. Half of the piglets fed HCC showed diarrhea and recovered, and all piglets survived. In contrast, all piglets fed UCC developed diarrhea and three of them died. In experiment 2, 2-day-old piglets fed HCC containing antibody titers of 1:512, 1:128 and 1:32, and UCC were inoculated with PED virus, and survival rates after challenge were 100, 75, 50 and 0 %, respectively. In experiment 3, 1-day-old piglets fed HCC with 1:512 antibody titer or UCC were inoculated and necropsied at 24, 48 and 72 hr after the inoculation for pathological examination. Piglets fed HCC remained healthy and PED virus antigen was not detected in the epithelial cells of the small intestine, and the length of the villi in small intestine was normal. On the other hand, in piglets fed UCC, villous atrophy and PED virus antigen were observed in epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum from 24 hr. It was concluded that oral administration of HCC to piglets was effective in preventing PED virus infection and reduced their mortality.

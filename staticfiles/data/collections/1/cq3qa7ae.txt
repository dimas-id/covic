One of the most serious, potentially life-threatening complications of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is staple-line leakage. Oversewing the LSG staple line vs buttressing it with bovine pericardial strips (BPS) to reduce perioperative bleeding and postoperative gastric leak was evaluated. From 2006 through 2011, 160 patients underwent LSG with suturing as the only staple-line reinforcement (Group A). From March 2010 through August 2012, 84 LSG patients had BPS incorporated into their last two stapler firings (Group B). Staple lines were evaluated perioperatively for bleeding, and patients were monitored for indications of staple-line leaks (peritonitis, abnormal output from the drain). In preoperative Group A and B, there were 117 (73.1%) vs. 56 (66.7%) females; mean age, 35.2 years (18.0-68.0) vs. 33.8 years (15.0-64.0); mean body mass index (BMI, kilograms per square meter), 42.5 (27.0-76.0) vs. 42.0 (30.0-58.0). Three months after surgery, mean BMI for Group A was 37.3 (-5.9); Group B, 35.2 (-7.3); at 6 months, 32.7 (-10.8) and 31.5 (-11.3; p < 0.001). Although there was no significant difference in perioperative blood loss, oversewn staple lines in Group A often required electrocautery to stanch bleeding; this was not required for Group B. In Group A, 15 patients (9.4%) developed complications; in Group B, five (6.0%; p = 0.46). Gastric fistula, verified by barium swallow, occurred in eight Group A patients (5.0%); in Group B, one (1.2%; p = 0.17). Relative to oversewing, staple-line buttressing with bovine pericardium was readily accomplished, safe, and associated with a lower staple-line leak rate.

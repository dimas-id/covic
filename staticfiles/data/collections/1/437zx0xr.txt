BACKGROUND: Hospital preparedness for infectious disease emergencies is imperative for local, regional, and national response planning. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted of a survey administered to Infection Control Professionals (ICPs) in May, 2005. RESULTS: Most hospitals have ICP representation on their disaster committee, around-the-clock infection control support, a plan to prioritize health care workers to receive vaccine or antivirals, and non-health care facility surge beds. Almost 20% lack a surge capacity plan. Some lack negative pressure rooms for current patient loads or any surge capacity. Less than half have a plan for rapid set-up of negative pressure, and Midwest hospitals are less likely than other areas to have such plans. Smaller hospitals have less negative pressure surge capacity than do larger hospitals. About half have enough health care workers to respond to a surge that involves ≤50 patients; few can handle ≥100 patients. Many do not have sufficient ventilators or can handle ≤10 additional ventilated patients. Most do not have enough National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health–approved respirators, and less than half have sufficient surgical masks to handle a significant surge. CONCLUSIONS: United States hospitals lack negative pressure, health care worker, and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity. Hospitals must continue to address gaps in infectious disease emergency planning.

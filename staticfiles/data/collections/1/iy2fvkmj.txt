Acid-resistance systems are essential for pathogenic Escherichia coli to survive in the strongly acidic environment of the human stomach (pH < 2.5). Among these, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) system is the most effective. However, the precise mechanism of GAD induction is unknown. We previously reported that a tolC mutant lacking the TolC outer membrane channel was defective in GAD induction. Here, we show that indole, a substrate of TolC-dependent efflux pumps and produced by the tryptophanase encoded by the tnaA gene, negatively regulates GAD expression. GAD expression was restored by deleting tnaA in the tolC mutant; in wild-type E. coli, it was suppressed by adding indole to the growth medium. RNA-sequencing revealed that tnaA mRNA levels drastically decreased upon exposure to moderately acidic conditions (pH 5.5). This decrease was suppressed by RNase E deficiency. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA is accelerated upon acid exposure, which decreases intracellular indole concentrations and triggers GAD induction.

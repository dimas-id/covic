BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to investigate endotracheal tube cuff pressure alteration in patients during laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery. METHODS Forty patients with ASA I-II physical status, who were scheduled for elective laparoscopic (group I) or open abdominal surgery (group II) were enrolled in the study. Tracheal intubation was always performed by an experienced anesthesiologist. The endotracheal tube cuff was inflated with air through a 10-ml syringe. The cuff was connected to a manometer. The endotracheal cuff pressure was registered every 5 min after tracheal intubation. At the time of discharge from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and 12 h after tracheal extubation, patients were asked about their laryngotracheal condition by an independent observer who was uninformed of the patient allocation groups. We investigated laryngotracheal complaints such as sore throat, dysphasia, and hoarseness. RESULTS The endotracheal cuff pressures in group I were significantly higher than those in the group II at all time points studied (P < 0.05). The endotracheal cuff pressures exceeded the critical pressure of 30 cmH(2)O after 5 min in the group I (intra-abdominal pneumoperitoneum was started). The incidence of sore throat was higher in group I than in group II in the PACU and at 12 h. CONCLUSION This study indicates that the CO(2) pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position used during laparoscopy increase endotracheal cuff pressure and lead to discomfort in the postoperative patient. Measurement of endotracheal cuff pressure is a simple and inexpensive procedure and should be applied in patients under going laparoscopic surgery.

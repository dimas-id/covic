INTRODUCTION Urachal remnants are relatively rare. Generally, urachal remnants are detected in young people, and the removed specimen is small, comprising a good indication for laparoscopic surgery. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) for urachal remnants is considered to be safe and result in an excellent cosmetic outcome. Therefore, we report our single-center experience with LESS for urachal remnants. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with urachal remnants who underwent LESS from January 2011 to December 2017. The patients' characteristics, surgical data, postoperative pain, and cosmetic assessment results were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Mean total operative time was 151 min, mean pneumoperitoneal surgery time was 83 min, and mean estimated blood loss was 5.0 mL. All patients were started on an oral diet and began ambulating on postoperative day 1. Mean hospital stay was 5.5 days. LESS was completed successfully in all patients, with no conversion to conventional or open surgery. CONCLUSIONS LESS is a viable option for the surgical treatment of urachal remnants. This technique may result in less pain than conventional techniques. Further accumulation of surgical outcomes (especially regarding safety and cosmesis) is required for LESS to become an established treatment for urachal remnants.

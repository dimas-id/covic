Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought challenges to delivery of care for older adults on inpatient psychiatry. We describe 2 cases: patient A, a 62-year-old woman who initially refused screening for potential COVID-19, bringing up questions about threshold for capacity when public health is at risk and questions about whether screening for infection should be different in older adults. The other case, patient B, is that of an 83-year-old man who was on the unit when patient A tested positive, and brought up concerns for risk of dissemination in the context of wandering, spitting behaviors and inability to adhere to room isolation or masking measures. We review measures taken to decrease risk of transmission and improve screening for infection in older adults.

The 30th annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) was held in Orlando, FL, on Oct. 27-29, 2016. Abstracts were published in a supplement to Pediatric Pulmonology.(1) This review summarizes several major topic areas addressed at the conference: the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease,clinical trials, clinical management issues, and quality improvement. We sought to provide an overview of emerging concepts in several areas of CF research and care, rather than a comprehensive review of the conference. Citations from the conference are by first author and abstract number or symposium number, as designated in the supplement.

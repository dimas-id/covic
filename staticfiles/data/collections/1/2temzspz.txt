To develop new Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays for nucleic acid detection for infectious diseases. Development of new assays on demand for emerging infectious diseases. For example, no proper nucleic acid-based tests exist for detection of H1N1 influenza virus. My lab, being the parasitology research unit aims to fill this gap by developing this ability.

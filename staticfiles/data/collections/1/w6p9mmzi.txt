Parasitic Crustacea have been present in scientific literature since Linnaeus introduced the first classification system (binomial nomenclature). Crustaceans are considered to be the most morphologically diverse arthropods, with currently 19 parasitic orders known to science. This chapter reviews the history of discovery for each of the major parasitic Crustacea groups, highlighting some of the key developments that have influenced our current understanding of these parasites. Each taxonomic group is briefly introduced, followed by a synopsis on some of the outstanding contributions within that group. Knowledge development is followed, from the first parasites discovered to other historical highlights that influenced the groups up to this point. Other important discoveries (both taxonomic and ecological) are also noted, serving as a preview to the host-parasite interactions covered in the subsequent chapters. Additionally, several researchers who have added significant contributions to our knowledge of the parasitic Crustacea (specifically in taxonomy and discovery) are introduced, along with photographs of a select few. This historical review of the crustacean parasites provides a background to these diverse and abundant organisms and will contribute to a better understanding of their unique niche in the aquatic environment.

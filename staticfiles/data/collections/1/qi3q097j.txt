OBJECTIVES To assess and compare the 5-year success rate of resin-bonded fixed partial dentures (RBFPDs) fabricated from different materials. METHODS An electronic search on 3 databases from January 1965 to March of 2017 was done for human randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective cohort studies. The key words used in the search were: Bridge OR bridges OR fixed partial OR fixed dental AND resin bonded OR Maryland OR ceramic bonded. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Success was defined as the RBFPDs remaining in situ and not having experienced debonding, biological failures, or mechanical failures at the examination visit. RESULTS Meta analyses of the included studies showed an estimated 5-year success rate of 88.18% for the metal framework RBFPDs and 84.41% for the nonmetal framework RBFPDs. The estimated 5-year success rate for each nonmetal material category was 92.07% for zirconia, 94.26% for In-Ceram alumina, and 84.83% for fiber-reinforced composite. The failure rate was not statistically significant among the single, double, and multiple retainers RBFPDs (P > .05). Technical complications were the main reason for failures. CONCLUSION The 5-year clinical performance of RBFPDs is similar to the performance of conventional fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and implant-supported crowns. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Clinicians should consider using RBFPDs more often because their clinical performance is similar to the performance of conventional FPDs and implant-supported crowns.

The clinical profile of human rhinovirus (HRV) with regard to lower respiratory infections remains unclear. We analyzed the clinical features and cytokine responses of HRV isolates in children with respiratory infections. Quantitative analysis and genotyping of the HRV-positive samples from 601 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were performed using VP4/VP2 sequencing. To compare T-helper1 (Th1) type (IFN-γ, TNF-α) and Th2 type (IL-4, IL-10) cytokine responses between HRV-A, B and C, the levels of the four cytokines were measured. The HRV-positive children had shorter fever duration (P = 0.018), and higher frequencies of chest retraction (P = 0.002) and wheezing (P = 0.022) than did the HRV-negative group. HRV-A was identified in 55 cases (58.5%), HRV-B in 8 (8.5%), and HRV-C in 31 (33.0%). There were no significant differences in the clinical data or NPA cytokines levels between patients with HRV-A and HRV-C infections. HRV is an important pathogen of the lower respiratory tract in young children. HRV-A and HRV-C are the dominant species that cause respiratory difficulty in young children.

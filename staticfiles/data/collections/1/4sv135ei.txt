Background Patients experiencing severe asthma exacerbations have a poorer quality of life and an increase in morbidity and mortality. Viruses are frequently involved in asthma exacerbations. Objective To determine the value of measuring serum IgG concentrations in asthma exacerbations and assess their link with viral infections in patients hospitalized for asthma. Methods Patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation were included in an observational study from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015. Serum IgG concentrations on admission were compared between patients with a positive upper airway viral sample and those with a negative viral sample. Results Among the 82 patients included, those with positive viral nasopharyngeal samples (n = 40) presented with lower serum IgG concentrations during exacerbation than those with a negative viral sample (n = 42) (10.1 ± 2.3 g/L vs 11.5 ± 3.6 g/L; P < .05). The median concentration of serum IgG was lower in patients hospitalized for more than 3 days compared with those hospitalized for less than 3 days (10.0 g/L [8.2-12.4] vs 11.4 g/L [10.1-12.8]; P < .05) and in patients who received oral corticosteroid therapy for more than 5 days compared with those treated with oral steroids for less than 5 days (10.1 g/L [8.3-12.2] vs 11.6 g/L [10.0-13.8]; P < .05). Conclusions Serum IgG level was significantly lower when asthma exacerbations were associated with positive viral samples. The patients with lower serum IgG concentrations required longer hospitalizations and longer courses of steroids.

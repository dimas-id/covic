Abstract An estimated 700000 children die annually due to diarrhea with majority of these occurring in children under the age of 5 years. Morbidity from diarrhea includes poor growth and development. The global diarrhea burden is primarily due to infections secondary to rotavirus, cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella species. Known interventions to effectively treat and prevent diarrhea include vaccines against rotavirus and cholera, zinc supplementation, and therapy with oral rehydration solution. The achievement of the fourth Millennium Development Goal requires reductions in mortality from diarrhea, and can only be accomplished by implementing evidence-based strategies.

Isolated ostial stenosis (IOS) is a rare disease that encroaches on aorto-coronary junction of uncertain etiology. All distal coronary vessels present normally. IOS occurs predominantly in premenopausal young women with few risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. Here, we report a 40-year-old woman who had experienced crescendo angina for 4 months. Surgical revascularization was achieved by robotic totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass (TECAB) with left internal thoracic artery (LITA) graft. She resumed her daily tasks without difficulties 1 week after the operation. Postoperative computed tomographic angiography disclosed good opacification of the LITA graft and distal runoff. Robotic TECAB is a potentially feasible alternative for IOS patients, particularly in premenopausal young woman, with obvious benefits of cosmetic appearance and speedy recovery.

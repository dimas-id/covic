Despite a substantial increase in our knowledge of the biodiversity and evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses, far less is known about the diversity, evolution and origin of RNA viruses across the diverse phylogenetic range of viruses, and particularly in healthy animals that are often only rarely utilized for virological sampling. Fortunately, recent advances in virus discovery using metagenomic approaches are beginning to reveal a multitude of RNA viruses in vertebrates other than birds and mammals. In particular, fish harbor a remarkable array of RNA viruses, including the relatives of important pathogens. In addition, despite frequent cross-species transmission, the RNA viruses in vertebrates generally follow the evolutionary history of their hosts, which began in the oceans and then moved to terrestrial habitats over timescales covering hundreds of millions of years.

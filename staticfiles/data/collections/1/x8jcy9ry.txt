According to the outbreak of H1N1 influenza on campus in Langfang city, Hebei province, at north of China in 2009, this paper constructed an artificial society model of the school, and simulated the spread of H1N1 influenza at the fifth floor in dormitory building. Firstly, it built the geographic environment model in accordance with the real dormitory building and a social relationship network model, including classmates, roommates and playmates. Secondly, it designed the behaviors and activities of students during a day, and built role based agent models of student. Each agent student had three roles, which were susceptible, infectious and recovered student.

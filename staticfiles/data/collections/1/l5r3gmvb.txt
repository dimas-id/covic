The pleura are composed of two layers, parietal and visceral layers, separated by a pleural space. The parietal pleuron is supplied by systemic vessels and drains into the right atrium via the azygos, hemiazygos, and internal mammary veins. The visceral pleuron is supplied by bronchial and pulmonary vessels and drains into the pulmonary veins.

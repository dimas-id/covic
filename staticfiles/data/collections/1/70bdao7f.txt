Due to the cellular entry of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) modulated by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the ACE2 bearing prostate is therefore hypothesized as a susceptible organ to COVID-19. To delineate whether the pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be detected in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS), a total of ten male patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. All patients were stratified into two groups: one group with positive nasopharyngeal swabbing SARS-CoV-2 within 3 days of the EPS taken day (PNS group, n = 3) and the other group with previously positive nasopharyngeal swabbing SARS-CoV-2 but turned negative before the taken day (PNNS group, n = 7). The COVID-19 patients showed elevated inflammatory indictors, i.e. C-reaction protein (3.28 (1.14, 33.33) mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (22.50 (8.00, 78.50) mm/h), and interleukin-6 (6.49 (4.96, 21.09) pg/ml). Serum IgM against SARS-CoV-2 was only positive in the PNS group, whereas serum IgG was positive for all patients. Furthermore, our data showed for the first time that none of the COVID-19 patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in EPS. To this end, this study found the negativity of SARS-CoV-2 in EPS and possibly exclude the sexual transmission of COVID-19.

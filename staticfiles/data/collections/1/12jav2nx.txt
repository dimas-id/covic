Delivery of routine and established medical care has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Acutely unwell patients are being prioritised, and large numbers of doctors and inpatient beds are required to deliver this care. We have recognised the impact that this disruption will have on patients with presumed and/or confirmed pleural and/or peritoneal malignancies. We present our service transformation and hope that the learning from this reconfiguration can be adopted by other organisations.

Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome is a devastating disease, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of neuroimaging in establishing a diagnosis and elucidating the pathogenesis. We analyzed the neuroradiologic features of 22 patients who fulfilled the Levin criteria. All patients underwent brain computed tomography (CT), and 14 patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging in 10 patients. Initial CT showed normal findings in 14 of 18 (78%) patients, but subsequently hypodensities appeared in bilateral watershed zones and progressed to whole brain edema. MRI revealed cytotoxic edema, showing hyperintensities in bilateral watershed zones on diffusion-weighted imaging with a low apparent diffusion coefficient. Serial neuroimaging showed characteristic features of a widespread brain ischemic event mainly in watershed zones in hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome.

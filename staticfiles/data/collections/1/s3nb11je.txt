Complementary tools are warranted to increase the sensitivity of the initial testing for COVID‐19. We identified a specific “sandglass” aspect on the white blood cells scattergram of COVID‐19 patients reflecting the presence of circulating plasmacytoid lymphocytes. Patients were dichotomized as COVID‐19 positive or negative based on RT‐PCR and chest CT scan results. Sensitivity and specificity of the “sandglass” aspect were 85.9% and 83.5% respectively. The positive predictive value was 94.3%. Our findings provide a non‐invasive and simple tool to quickly categorize symptomatic patients as either COVID‐19 probable or improbable especially when RT‐PCR and/or chest CT are not rapidly available.

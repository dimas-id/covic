In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, many were quick to spread deceptive information. I investigate here how reasoning in Description Logics (DLs) can detect inconsistencies between trusted medical sources and not trusted ones. The not-trusted information comes in natural language (e.g."Covid-19 affects only the elderly"). To automatically convert into DLs, I used the FRED converter. Reasoning in Description Logics is then performed with the Racer tool.

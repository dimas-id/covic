INTRODUCTION Today, endoscopic adrenalectomy has become a gold standard in endocrine surgery. METHOD AND RESULTS To minimize the morbidity and improve cosmesis, a single access retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy (SARA) has been developed. Patients were placed in prone position. Through a single 1.5 cm skin incision at the tip of the 12th rib the creation of the retroperitoneal space and the dissection of the adrenal gland were performed. SARA was used in five patients with adrenal tumors (size: 1-4 cm; four right, one left). Operating time ranged from 35 to 70 min, mean blood loss was <10 ml. No perioperative or postoperative complications were noticed. Mean hospital stay was 2 days. CONCLUSIONS SARA is feasible and represents a new horizon in endocrine surgery.

Interventional radiologists have a variety of techniques in their armamentarium to treat pulmonary tumors. While most therapies are targeted to metastasis or palliation, percutaneous thermal ablation represents a potential therapy for not only palliation, but to treat inoperable early stage disease. Although radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most studied of these ablative techniques, newer technologies of thermal ablation, such as microwave and cryoablation have emerged as additional options. In this article, we will review the three different thermal ablative modalities, including patient selection, technique, outcomes, complications, and imaging follow-up. A brief discussion of state of the art techniques such as irreversible electroporation (IRE) and catheter directed therapies will also be included.

An estimated 1.9 million children travel overseas annually. Infectious disease risks associated with international travel are diverse and depend on the destination, planned activities, and baseline medical history. Children have special needs and vulnerabilities that should be addressed when preparing for travel abroad. Children should have a pretravel health assessment that includes recommendations for both routine and special travel-related vaccination; malaria chemoprophylaxis, if indicated; and prevention counseling regarding insect and animal exposures, food and water safety, and avoiding injuries. Special consideration should be given to children with chronic diseases. Families should be given anticipatory guidance for management of potential illnesses and information about the location of medical resources overseas.

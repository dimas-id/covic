The following six methods for detecting rotavirus in human faecal samples were compared: electron microscopy, immune electron microscopy, immunofluorescence in cell culture, two enzyme immunoassays (Rotazyme, Enzygnost) and a latex agglutination test (Rotalex). Specimens were collected from 112 children with diarrhoea. The relative sensitivities of the different assays for human rotavirus were as follows: electron microscopy, 84%; immunofluorescence, 86%; Rotalex, 88%; Rotazyme, 89%; immune electron microscopy, 93%; Enzygnost, 98%. According to our findings Enzygnost is the most sensitive method, but Rotalex is more valuable for screening a small number of faecal samples. No false-positive results were observed in the two enzyme immunoassays or in Rotalex.

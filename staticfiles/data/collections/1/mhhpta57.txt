Abstract C-X-C motif chemokine 17 (CXCL-17) is a novel chemokine that plays a functional role maintaining homeostasis at distinct mucosal barriers, including regulation of myeloid-cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and control of microorganisms. Particularly, CXCL17 is produced along the epithelium of the airways both at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. While increased CXCL17 expression is associated with disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung/hepatic cancer, it is thought to play a protective role in pancreatic cancer, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral infections. Thus, there is emerging evidence pointing to both a harmful and protective role for CXCL17 in human health and disease, with therapeutic potential for translational applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery, characteristics and functions of CXCL17 emphasizing its clinical potential in respiratory disorders.

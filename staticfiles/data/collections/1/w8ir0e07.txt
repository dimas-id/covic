ABSTRACT Two strains of Acanthamoeba isolated from human brain tissue and a strain of Acanthamoeba isolated from a fish were compared with 10 species of Acanthamoeba belonging to groups 1, 2 and 3 based on their isoenzyme profiles and antigenic characteristics. A total of 12 enzymes were studied. The isoenzymes and antigens were electrophoretically separated on polyacrylamide gradient gels, and the patterns obtained were compared after appropriate staining for particular enzymes and reactivities with homologous and heterologous rabbit anti‐Acanthamoeba antisera. One of the human strains (CDC:1283:V013) was identified as A. healyi n. sp. because of its unique isoenzyme profiles for 11 of the 12 enzymes tested. The other human isolate was reidentified as A. culbertsoni because its isoenzyme profiles for 10 of 12 enzymes resembled those of A. culbertsoni, Lilly A‐1 strain. Since the isoenzyme profiles and the antigenic patterns of the fish isolate as well were remarkably similar to those of A. royreba, it was considered as a strain of A. royreba. Polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis appears to be a powerful technique for the study of isoenzymes and antigens of Acanthamoeba.

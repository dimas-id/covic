Abstract Since late 2010, highly virulent PEDV G2-genotype strains have emerged globally extracting heavy losses on the pork industries of numerous countries. We investigated the characteristics of a field strain of PEDV (PEDV strain SH) isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea on a farm in Shanghai China. Whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the SH strain belonged to subtype G2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion (aa 399–410) including the antigenic epitope NEP-1C9 (aa 398–406) of the N protein. PEDV SH strain is highly pathogenic to challenged newborn piglets, resulting in 100 % morbidity and mortality. Pathological examination revealed significant villus atrophy in the jejuna of infected piglets. Mice inoculated with inactivated PEDV SH produced antibodies against the N protein, but no antibodies against the deletions. These results illustrated that deletion of the NEP-1C9 epitope had no effect on the immunogenicity or pathogenicity of PEDV, providing evidence of the necessity to monitor the genetic diversity of the virus. Our study also contributes to development of candidate for vaccines and diagnostics that could differentiate pigs seropositive due to vaccination by conventional strains from wild virus infection.

Cell-free synthetic biology system can perform biological transcription and translation process in vitro. Because of its advanced features, such as flexible openness, easy control, short expression time and high tolerance to cytotoxicity, this systemhas been successfully used to synthesize proteins that are difficult to express in cells. With the continuous development of cell-free biosensing technology and the lyophilization technology, its applications have widely expanded into many biomedical fields. This review discusses the current research progress of cell-free synthetic biology system in on-demand biopharmaceutical synthesis, portable diagnostics, and others. Further development of the system can lead to even more complicated synthesis of therapeutic proteins with post-translational modifications and evolution of different cell-free biosensors with high sensitivity. Cell-free synthetic biology as an emerging engineering strategy can be a better means applied to high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical proteins, detection of new pathogens, and other important health-care fields in the future.

We report a statistical analysis of some highly infected countries by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The cumulative infected data were fitted with various growth models (e.g. Logistic equation, Weibull equation and Hill equation) and obtained the power index of top ten highly infected countries. The newly infected data were fitted with Gaussian distribution with the peak at ~40 days for the countries whose infection curves are seem to be saturated. The similarity in growth kinetics of infected people of different countries provides first-hand guidelines to take proper precautions to minimize human damage.

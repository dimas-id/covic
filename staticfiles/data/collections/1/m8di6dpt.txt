Objective To understand potential drivers and barriers to influenza vaccination in the general population. Methods 47 982 household surveys were conducted in five European countries between 2001 and 2006. Results Overall influenza vaccination coverage increased over the years and reached 26·2% in 2005/06. Among the elderly ≥65 years, the rate increased significantly to 67·8% (2005/06). The most common reason for being vaccinated over the 5 years was the perception of influenza as a serious illness, which people want to avoid. The main reason for not getting vaccinated among those never previously vaccinated was feeling that they were unlikely to catch influenza. A recommendation by the family physician was the most encouraging factor for vaccination.

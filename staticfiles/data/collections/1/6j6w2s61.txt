Risk perception of avian influenza in the Netherlands: high level of risk perception, but limited trust in protective measures Aim: To describe risk perception of avian influenza in the Netherlands in March 2006. To gain insight in the level of knowledge, precautionary actions, response and self efficacy, and use of media related to avian influenza. Methods: Through an Internet panel 579 respondents filled in an online questionnaire. Results. Risk perception of avian influenza in the Netherlands is, especially in case of an outbreak, high, 3,51 (scale 1 – 5). 23,7% of respondents believe that protection against avian influenza is possible, while 28,2% feel that they are able to protect oneself. A higher level of response and self efficacy is related to a lower level of risk perception. Respondents with an higher risk perception have taken more precautionary actions. 38% of respondents had taken at least one precautionary action. All respondents had heard of avian influenza, but knowledge was limited, 2,33 (scale 1 – 4). Television was the most important source of information. Conclusions: Risk perception of avian influenza is relatively high in the Netherlands at a time when no infections were reported. The low levels of response and self efficacy warrant attention so that advice about preventive measures will be adhered to in case of an outbreak.

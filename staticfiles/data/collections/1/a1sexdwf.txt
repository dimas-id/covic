Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SIS) is less invasive than standard laparoscopic surgery; however, it is more difficult due to restriction of motion and the impossibility to use assistants. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a self-sustaining multipurpose internal retractor by attaching a Lone Star retractor hook to a laparoscopic bulldog clamp. Herein, we report our SIS experience using our novel retractor. Between October 2008 and April 2011, 104 patients underwent SIS using the internal retractor: 67 bandings (43% simultaneous hiatal hernia repair), 8 sleeve gastrectomies, 27 cholecystectomies, and 2 Nissen fundoplication. Mean age was 40 (range, 21 to 85) and mean body mass index was 40 kg/m (range, 20 to 64 kg/m). No intraoperative complications were observed from the use of the retractor but 2 cases required additional retraction due to liver size. This retractor has been successfully used for different SIS procedures showing to be safe, adaptable, and easy to use, lessening some challenges of SIS.

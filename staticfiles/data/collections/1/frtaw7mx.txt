Human bocavirus genotype (HBoV-1) is a parvovirus associated with respiratory tract infections in children with different degrees of severity. The current study intended to improve the direct gene sequencing of the HBoV-1 using a newly developed primer set. Screening the presence of human bocavirus infection among in-patients children suffering from lower respiratory tract infections was another aim of the current study. Nasopharyngeal swab samples from in-patients children suffering from lower respiratory tract infections were examined. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for the initial screening as a highly sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Genotyping of real-time positive samples was attempted by direct sequencing of PCR amplicons using NP, VP1/2 and the newly developed VP/NC primers. HBoV-1 was present in 56.8% of the examined children. The newly developed primer set successfully amplified all real-time PCR positive samples, however, the other primer pairs did not reliably detect real-time PCR positive samples. The gene sequences of the detected HBoV-1 showed conserved sequences to each other with a low rate of discrepancies. The high rate of infection and the similarity between the detected strains strongly suggest nosocomial infections.

Previously we have found that DNA vaccine, pCMV4-rZPC' can generate specific antibodies against rabbit ZPC (amino acid 263-415, rZPC'), which binds to ovarian ZP and leads to a significant reduction of fertility in vivo. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antisera from pCMV4-rZPC(')-immunized mice on sperm-oocyte interaction in vitro. The effect of antisera from DNA vaccine-immunized mice on fertilization and early embryonic development was studied using an in vitro fertilization system. The results showed that the antisera supplemented in fertilization medium (10%, v/v) significantly decreased the rate of fertilization compared to that of control groups (P<0.05); whereas the antisera showed no significant effect on the rate of fertilization when ZP-free eggs were used. Moreover, the antisera pre-neutralized with mouse soluble zona pellucida lost the capacity to inhibit fertilization when compared with that of control groups. In addition, the antisera showed no detrimental effect on early developmental potential of mouse embryos in vitro. Taken together, our study provided herein direct evidence showing that antisera generated by DNA vaccine can block sperm-egg recognition during fertilization via targeting the oocyte ZP proteins.

The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of global health concern. It is a serious public health emergency for the entire world, threatening human life and public health security. To address the epidemic, it is necessary not only to take good prevention and treatment measures, but also to have effective and targeted public health emergency governance. That said, reports focusing on governance are scant. In this commentary, we summarize Chinaâ€™s model to combat the COVID-19 epidemic from a public health emergency governance approach. Stemmed from goals and values, a number of mechanisms are put forward, which include: a whole-of-government response and accountability, setting up a multi-sectoral cooperation platform, swiftly scaling up epidemic emergency capacity, whole-of-society actions with engagement of social organizations, and engaging citizens in the epidemic prevention and control. As the epidemic continues to evolve, other countries might learn from China to build their own, context-specific models for better outcomes.

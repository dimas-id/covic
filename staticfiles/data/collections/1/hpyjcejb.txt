For functional diversity, the large (L) envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) acquires a dual transmembrane topology via co-translational membrane integration of the S region and partial post-translational translocation of the preS subdomain. Because each process requires the second transmembrane segment (TM2), we explored the action of this determinant by using protease protection analysis of mutant L proteins. We demonstrated that neither the disruption of a leucine zipper-like motif by multiple alanine substitutions nor the flanking charges of TM2 affected the topological reorientation of L. The dispensability of both putative subunit interaction modules argues against a link between preS post-translocation and envelope assembly. Phenotypic mixing experiments revealed that the preS and S protein domains of the related duck HBV L polypeptide failed to substitute functionally for the topogenic elements of HBV in directing the correct L topogenesis, implicating different translocation mechanisms used by the two hepadnavirus genera.

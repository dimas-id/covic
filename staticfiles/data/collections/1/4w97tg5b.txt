Over the last decade, both basic researchers and surgeons have sought to identify the most appropriate techniques to be applied in flexor tendon repairs. Recent developments in experimental tendon repairs and clinical outcomes of newer repair techniques have been reviewed in an attempt to comprehensively summarize the most critical mechanical factors affecting the performance of tendon repairs and the surgical factors influencing clinical outcomes. Among them, attention to annular pulleys, the purchase and tension of the core suture, and the direction and curvature of the path of tendon motion have been found to be determining factors in the results of tendon repair.

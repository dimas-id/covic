The increased use of inbred and genetically altered mice, often with compromised immune systems, has resulted in the need for stringent environmental conditions and management practices. This in turn has increased the need to thoroughly monitor the environment of mice and the equipment used for their care. Environmental and equipment monitoring are viewed as management tools used to control the quality of mice produced or housed in the facility. Their purpose is to help safeguard the health of the animals and personnel. In its distilled form, much of environmental and equipment monitoring is common sense coupled with a constant awareness that an animal care program is a dynamic organization dependent on the interaction of animals and people with the physical facility. If the animals are to remain healthy and the physical plant is to continue to function properly, there is little room for error. The errors arise neither from the animals nor the equipment but from the people who are responsible for developing a management policy and style that maintains the health of the animals and the integrity of the physical plant, yet at the same time makes it a pleasant and functional place for both mice and people to accomplish their intended tasks.

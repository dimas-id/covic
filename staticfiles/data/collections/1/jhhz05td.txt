I read with interest the recent published article from Professor Robert L. Medcalf, entitled “Fibrinolysis and COVID‐19: a plasmin paradox” [1]. As an indirect marker of thrombin and plasmin activation, D‐dimer has been suggested to guide anticoagulant treat in COVID‐19 patients [2, 3]. However, D‐dimer may not be able to reflect accurate fibrinolysis status of COVID‐19 patients, and therefore can’t guide the possible antifibrinolysis or thrombolytic therapy in different stages of COVID‐19, as Professor Robert L. Medcalf discussed. Hence, we speculated that measuring direct markers of thrombin, plasmin and so on, may provide more therapeutic targets in COVID‐19 patients with coagulopathy.

Abstract The purpose of this study was to assess the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in feline uveitis by measuring IL-6 activity in the serum and aqueous humor of cats. Serum and aqueous humor was collected from clinically normal, random source cats (n = 10); clinically normal, specific-pathogen free cats experimentally inoculated with Toxoplasma gondii strain ME49 and sampled sequentially for 20 months (n = 4); and client-owned cats with uveitis (n = 27). Interleukin 6 activity was measured in each sample. Client-owned cats with uveitis were also evaluated for evidence of present or prior exposure to T. gondii, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline coronaviruses. Interleukin 6 activity was non-detectable or low in serum from cats of each group. Interleukin 6 activity was not detected in aqueous humor of clinically normal cats. Interleukin 6 activity was detected in 22 27 (81.5%) aqueous humor samples from cats with uveitis, with a range of 28.9 U ml−1-15702.9 U ml−1 (mean = 1911.9 U ml−1, SD = 3946.7 U ml−1). Serologic evidence of exposure to T gondii, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, or a coronavirus was present in 21 27 (77.8%) cats with uveitis. Interleukin 6 was detected in the aqueous humor of 18 21 (85.7%) and 3 6 (50%) of the cats with and without serologic evidence of exposure to one to the infectious diseases, respectively. Statistically significant increases in mean IL-6 activity in aqueous humor were found for cats with any evidence of infection with T. gondii, for cats with T. gondii antigen in aqueous humor and for cats with coronavirus antibody titers ≥ 1:100. Aqueous humor IL-6 activity was greater than corresponding serum IL-6 activity in 21 27 cats. These results show that IL-6 is produced intraocularly in some cats with uveitis and that IL-6 may be a mediator of uveitis in cats.

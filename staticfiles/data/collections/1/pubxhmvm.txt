OBJECTIVE To estimate the accuracy of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) as a biomarker for acute kidney injury (AKI) in children. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed. The review protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD 42015024153). We conducted searches in the following databases: Medline (PubMed), LILACS (BVS), SCOPUS (Elsevier), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Biomed Central, and ISI Web of Science, from January 1990 to October 2016. For inclusion, studies measured NGAL levels in plasma and urine for AKI in children. For each study, 2 Ã— 2 contingency tables were developed. For statistical analysis we calculated the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. For methodological assessment, we used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. Software used for analysis was Stata 14, and RevMan 5.3. RESULTS In total 13 studies were analyzed, which included 1629 children. For urinary NGAL, the pooled sensitivity was 0.76 (95% CI 0.62-0.85) and a pooled specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.88-0.96). The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for the detection of AKI was 43 (95% CI 16-115) and the Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96). For plasma NGAL the combined sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI 0.64-0.90) and a combined specificity was 0.87 (95% CI 0.74-0.94). The DOR was 26 (95% CI 8.0-82) and AUC was 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) for the detection of AKI in children. CONCLUSION The data suggest that NGAL levels can be an important biomarker for the early detection of AKI in children.

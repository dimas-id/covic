We compared PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) to culture using sonicate fluid from 431 subjects with explanted knee (n = 270) or hip (n = 161) prostheses. Of these, 152 and 279 subjects had prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and aseptic failure, respectively. The sensitivities for detecting PJI were 77.6% for PCR-ESI/MS and 69.7% for culture (P = 0.0105). The specificities were 93.5 and 99.3%, respectively (P = 0.0002).

Viruses hijack the host cell machinery and recruit host proteins to aid their replication. Several host proteins also play vital roles in inhibiting viral replication. Emerging class of host proteins central to both of these processes are the DEAD-box helicases: a highly conserved family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases, bearing a common D-E-A-D (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) motif. They play key roles in numerous cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, miRNA biogenesis and translation. Though their sequences are highly conserved, these helicases have quite diverse roles in the cell. Interestingly, often these helicases display contradictory actions in terms of the support and/or clearance of invading viruses. Increasing evidence highlights the importance of these enzymes, however, little is known about the structural basis of viral RNA recognition by the members of the DEAD-box family. This review summarizes the current knowledge in the field for selected DEAD-box helicases and highlights their diverse actions upon viral invasion of the host cell. We anticipate that through a better understanding of how these helicases are being utilized by viral RNAs and proteins to aid viral replication, it will be possible to address the urgent need to develop novel therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections.

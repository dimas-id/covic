Numerous published articles have shown the safety and efficacy of robotic lung resection, including lobectomy. The robotic approach offers similar survival rate to the open and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery methods. Potential advantages provided by robotic technology, such as three-dimensional (3D) high-quality camera, wristed tools and ergonomic ease that seems to overcome certain video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) limits have been widely described. Several techniques have been developed by different surgeons to perform a robotic lobectomy. In this study, we present our technique for performing a four-arm robotic lobectomy for the treatment of early stage lung cancer. This is shown in clear, sequential steps. We also provide an instrument preference card, some operative tips and a high-quality video.

INTRODUCTION We compared single incision laparoscopic surgery with flexible endoscope ("flexible SILS") and with rigid optic ("rigid SILS") for access to 11 elective sites of peritoneal carcinomatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Back-to-back flexible and rigid SILS peritoneoscopy were performed in ten live pigs. SILS peritoneoscopy was performed using a flexible endoscope or a rigid optic, in random order, together with two rigid 5-mm laparoscopic forceps. Primary endpoint was access success rate to 11 elective sites of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Findings for the most favorable option were then assessed in four human cadavers. RESULTS In the porcine model, the overall rate of access to targets was 98% with flexible SILS and 87% with rigid SILS (p < 0.001). Both flexible and rigid SILS allowed a 100% access rate to diaphragmatic domes, paracolic gutters, splenic and hepatic hilum, pelvic floor, and trigonal bladder. The rates of access to other sites by flexible versus rigid SILS, respectively, were: root of the mesentery (90 vs. 50%), origin of the inferior mesenteric vein (90 vs. 50%), inferior vena cava (100 vs. 90%), and cul-de-sac of Douglas (100 vs. 50%). No complications were observed. Procedures were performed in mean time of 26 and 24 min, respectively. These findings were confirmed for flexible SILS in four human cadavers. CONCLUSIONS Flexible SILS is superior to rigid SILS to evaluate the peritoneal cavity in a timely manner. This suggests a need for flexible instrumentation or other technical solutions to perform thorough minimally invasive surgical evaluation of peritoneal carcinomatosis.

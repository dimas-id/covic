INTRODUCTION Conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard surgical treatment for symptomatic gallstones. Surgeons have attempted to minimize the number of incisions via single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC), which offers benefits including improved cosmesis, possibly less postoperative pain, and improved patient satisfaction. However, studies show that there is an increased risk of operative complications-in particular bile duct injuries. We report 500 consecutive cases of SILC performed without bile duct injury. METHODS A retrospective study of 500 continuous cases of SILC performed by the same surgeon at a single institution was conducted. Data on patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. Detailed analysis of surgical techniques specifically to reduce bile duct injury was performed and described in this study. RESULTS In total, 500 patients underwent SILC during the study period. Eight patients needed additional ports to complete the surgery, while one was converted to an open surgery. No serious intraoperative complications, such as bile duct injury, were encountered. CONCLUSION Our experience shows that with due care and caution during SILC, with particular attention towards achieving the critical view of safety and a standardized technique, bile duct injury in SILC can be avoided.

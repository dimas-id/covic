This policy brief sets forth the American Geriatrics Societyʼs (AGSʼs) recommendations to guide federal, state, and local governments when making decisions about care for older adults in assisted living facilities (ALFs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. It focuses on the need for personal protective equipment, access to testing, public health support for infection control, and workforce training. The AGS continues to review guidance set forth in peer‐reviewed articles, as well as ongoing and updated guidance from the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other key agencies. This brief is based on the situation and any federal guidance or actions as of April 15, 2020. Joining a separate AGS policy brief on COVID‐19 in nursing homes (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16477), this brief is focused on ALFs, given that varied structure and staffing can impact their response to COVID‐19.

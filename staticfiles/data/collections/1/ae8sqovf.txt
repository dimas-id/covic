Obese patients are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections. During the H1N1 pandemic, obesity was associated with an increased risk of influenza-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer duration of ICU and hospital length of stay compared with the non-obese. These observations have raised a concern about the correlation between obesity and the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we have outlined the potential impacts of obesity on respiratory physiology and the function of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Also, it has been clearly illustrated that obese patients are potentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and more contagious than lean patients. The comorbidities associated with obesity were found to be correlated with a severe clinical course of COVID-19 and increased mortality and high BMI has been shown to be correlated with hospitalisation, the need for mechanical ventilation and non-survival. The review also sheds light on the challenges that obese patients pose for healthcare providers inside and outside ICUs.

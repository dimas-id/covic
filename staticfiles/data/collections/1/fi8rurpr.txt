Gene therapy and virotherapy are among the approaches currently being used to treat lung cancer. The success of cancer gene therapy depends on treatments where different types of tumors can be selectively targeted and destroyed without affecting normal cells and tissue. Previously, we described a promoter system (TTS) that we designed that is specifically targeted to lung cancer cells but which does not affect other types of cells including stem cells. In our study, we have enhanced the utility of the TTS system by inserting the pro-apoptotic gene BH3 domain interacting death agonist (Bid) into the TTS promoter system (TTS/Bid) to create a drug regulatable lung cancer-specific gene therapy. A recombinant adenoviral vector was used to introduce TTS/Bid (Ad-TTS/Bid) into lung cancer cells. BID expression and apoptosis occurred in A549 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells but little Bid expression or apoptosis occurred in MCF7 breast cancer cells or in normal human lung fibroblasts. The use of cisplatin enhanced the processing of full length BID to t-BID which significantly increased lung cancer-specific cell death. In in vivo experiments, intraperitonal injection of cisplatin enhanced the antitumor effects of the vector in a lung cancer xeno-graft mouse model. Moreover, dexamethasone effectively suppressed exogenous BID expression and the antitumor effect of Ad-TTS/Bid both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we describe the efficacy of the use of cisplatin and dexamethasone with the anti lung cancer promoter system (Ad-TTS/Bid) for a safe and effective gene therapy against advanced lung cancer.

We introduced a microplate method for virus isolation in the Department of Microbiology, Yamagata Prefectural Institute of Public Health (YPIPH) in 1999 in Yamagata, Japan. We have since carried out longitudinal epidemiological studies of viral infectious diseases, particularly, respiratory viruses, combining traditional technologies such as virus isolation and serological techniques and newly developed molecular methods. Here, we provide an overview of our activities at YPIPH between 1999 and 2018. During the study period, we observed emerging and re-merging diseases such as echovirus type 13, enterovirus D-68, parechovirus-A3 (PeV-A3), and Saffold virus. With regard to PeV-A3, we proposed a concept of new disease "PeV-A3-associated myalgia/myositis". We also revealed longitudinal epidemiologies for several viruses such as enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus A16. To perform longitudinal epidemiological studies at any time in Yamagata, we established our system for stocking clinical specimens, viral isolates, complementary DNAs and serum specimens. We also pursued collaboration works with virology laboratories across Japan. We hope our experiences, findings and research materials will further contribute to the development of countermeasures against viral infectious diseases and improvement in public health strategies in Yamagata, Japan, Asia and around the world.

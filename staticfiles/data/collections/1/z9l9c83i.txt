Ischemic heart failure caused by atherosclerosis is a major cause of death worldwide. Although remarkable technological advances have been made in the treatment of coronary heart disease, there is as yet no treatment that can sufficiently suppress the progression of atherosclerosis, including neointimal thickening. Therefore, a precise understanding of the mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia will provide the development of new technologies. Both ApoE-KO and LDLR-KO mice have been employed to generate other relevant mouse models of cardiovascular disease through breeding strategies. Although these mice are effective tools for the investigation of atherosclerosis, development of a progressive atherosclerotic lesion takes a long time, resulting in increase of both the costs and the space needed for the research. Thus, it is necessary to develop simpler tools that would allow easy evaluation of atherosclerosis in mouse models. In this review, we discuss our experience in generating mouse models of cuff-induced injury of the femoral artery and attempt to provide a better understanding of cuff-induced neointimal formation.

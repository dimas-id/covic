BACKGROUND Crohn's disease (CD) in association with obesity is becoming an increasing issue in Australia and worldwide. This report looks at outcomes for patients with CD undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of our database of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy from 2007 to 2016. Patients with concurrent CD were included. RESULTS Eight patients with CD underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with a mean preoperative body mass index of 43.8. There were no identified intraoperative or post-operative complications. The mean excess weight loss was 55.7% and 56.5% at 6 months and 1 year, respectively. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be achieved in CD patients. No complications and effective weight loss was observed in the eight reported patients.

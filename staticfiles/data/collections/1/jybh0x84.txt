Noroviruses are the leading cause of epidemic non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Despite their discovery over three decades ago, little is known about the host immune response to norovirus infection. The purpose of this chapter is to review the field of norovirus immunology and discuss the contributions of outbreak investigations, human and animal challenge studies and population-based studies. This chapter will survey both humoral and cellular immunity as well as recent advances in norovirus vaccine development.

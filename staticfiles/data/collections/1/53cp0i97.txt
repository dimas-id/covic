The aim of this manuscript is to discuss the viewpoint of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Gastric Cancer Taskforce and Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Gastric Cancer Study Group on the current challenges in the multidisciplinary management of stage II-III gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer. We seek to outline how these challenges are addressed in current trials of both groups. Key elements of future trials of EORTC and JCOG in this indication are described, and a joint vision on how multidisciplinary research of gastric and GEJ cancer patients should be organised is outlined.

Clinical examination allows the neurologist to test hypotheses generated by their interpretation of the patient's story. By eliciting abnormal clinical signs, the examining doctor works out a differential diagnosis for the part of the nervous system affected and, using information from the clinical history, a differential diagnosis of the pathology. Clinical examination also allows the clinician to observe and quantify function, hear more story and provide reassurance. The focus of the examination should be dictated by the hypothesis being tested, the patient's clinical state and the situation. Examination of the different parts of the nervous system remains very important in all clinical situations as the best available index of function of the nervous system as a whole.

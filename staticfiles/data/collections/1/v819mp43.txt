Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are one of the most frequent pathogens that circulate worldwide[1] . Four types of HPIVs were identified, including HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3 and HPIV-4. HPIVs can lead to acute respiratory infection in young[2] , the immunocompromised[3] and the elderly patients[4] . The epidemiological character of parainfluenza virus in Beijing has not been previously reported. In a consecutive 4-year surveillance of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) between January 2011 and December 2014, a total of 3978 specimens were collected from the fever outpatients with ARIs (with acute fever (temperature of ≥38℃) and cough or sore throat fewer than 5 days) by throat swab and sputum for those also with abnormal chest X-ray.

The potential of antimicrobial nanoparticles to control oral infections is reviewed. Such particles can be classified as having a size no greater than 100 nm and are produced using traditional or more novel techniques. Exploitation of the toxic properties of nanoparticles to bacteria, fungi and viruses, in particular metals and metal oxides, and their incorporation into polymeric materials have increased markedly over the past decade. The potential of nanoparticles to control the formation of biofilms within the oral cavity, as a function of their biocidal, anti-adhesive and delivery capabilities, is now receiving close attention. The latest insights into the application of nanoparticles within this field, including their use in photodynamic therapy, will be discussed. Possible approaches to alter biocompatibility and desired function will also be covered.

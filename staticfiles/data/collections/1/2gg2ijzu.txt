Laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) cholecystectomy requires a creative solution to retract the gallbladder. Transabdominal suture retraction is a commonly used technique to achieve adequate exposure of the critical structures within Calot's triangle. To avoid the multiple punctures of the gallbladder and abdominal wall required by such suture retraction, we developed a novel internal retractor specifically for use during LESS cholecystectomy. This retractor consists of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp fitted with a small metal hook, and was successfully used in a recent case of LESS cholecystectomy.

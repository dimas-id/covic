COVID-19 has given us a food for thought that whether we are prepared for such pandemics or not. Developed nations may say that they have enough resources to tackle such situations, but when it comes to the physical and emotional security of the children, even they have to think manifolds because preparing children for such pandemics need lot of effort and apt planning. The purpose of this chapter is to reflect issues related to children during any infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19. Adults are mature enough to control their emotions and can act patiently, but immature minds are always perplexed and act in a very clingy way when some adverse situation is thrown to them. Children are ardent observers and act according to the reactions of the folks around them. It is difficult for them to conceal their behavior, and it is difficult for parents as well to manage their anxiety levels. During crisis period when social distancing and refrained outdoor activities have brought our children into a knotty situation, it is necessary that we understand their fears and myths, try to resolve their concerns in a polite way and strengthen their minds. At this stage the role of parents, teachers, educational institutes, social media, and international childrenâ€™s organizations need to be redefined. The importance of the decisions taken by the governing bodies should be explained to the children in an effective way, so that they do not panic and reflect a brave attitude. UNICEF in collaboration with international health support systems and departments has a major role to play. Appropriate planning for preparing the children for pandemics has to be incorporated in our system, so that any future crisis can be dealt in an easier way. Schools colleges and other educational institutes should execute immunization and hygiene and health practices in advance to promote prevention.

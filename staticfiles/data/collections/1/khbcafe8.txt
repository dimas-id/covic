The theory of picture fuzzy sets is useful for handling uncertainty in multiple attribute decision making problems by considering membership, non-membership and indeterminacy degrees independently for each element. In this paper, by extending the classical linear assignment method, we propose a novel method which is called picture fuzzy linear assignment method (PF-LAM) for solving multiple criteria group decision-making problems with picture fuzzy sets. A ranking procedure consisting of aggregation functions, score functions, accuracy functions, and weighted rank frequency and a binary mathematical model are presented to determine the priority order of various alternatives. The applicability and validity of the proposed method is shown through the selection of pest house locations. The proposed method helps managers to find the best location to construct the pest house based on the determined criteria.

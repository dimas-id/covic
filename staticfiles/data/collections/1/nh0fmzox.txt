BACKGROUND: The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic, there are no specific drugs and vaccines for epidemic control at present. More and more clinical practice shows that traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in the outbreak. Among them, Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD) combined with antiviral drugs can enhance the therapeutic efficacy for COVID-19. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic evidence, which urgently requires us to verify its therapeutic efficacy. Hence, we provide a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We will search the studies in MEDLINE/PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, VIP database, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database and Chinese Science Citation Database. Searches are limited to clinical studies published in Chinese and English. Next, the quality of each study is assessed according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Then, the outcome data are recorded and pooled by Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 16.0 software. RESULTS: The systematic review and meta-analysis aims to review and pool current clinical outcomes of QPD combined with antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study will provide a high-quality evidence of QPD for the treatment on COVID-19 patients. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020182409.

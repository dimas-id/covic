We assessed the prevalence and impact of COVID-19 among multiple sclerosis (MS) patients across Europe by leveraging participant data collected as part of the ongoing EU IMI2 RADAR-CNS major programme aimed at finding new ways of monitoring neurological disorders using wearable devices and smartphone technology. In the present study, 399 patients of RADAR-MS have been included (mean age 43.9 years, 60.7% females) with 87/399 patients (21.8%) reporting major symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A trend for an increased risk of COVID-19 symptoms under alemtuzumab and cladribine treatments in comparison to injectables was observed. Remote monitoring technologies may support health authorities in monitoring and containing the ongoing pandemic.

Natural water, such as surface water and groundwater, exists as an open system. Natural and/or synthesized organic substances, oxygen, nutrients are thus able to enter various waters. Owing to the presence of these key elements, microbial growth eventually becomes possible. Different microorganisms can therefore exist and grow in the waters. Similarly, domestic and industrial wastewater and treated wastewater contain significantly high amounts of microorganisms.

Abstract The purpose of this introductory chapter is to provide the reader with a brief overview of the factors that drive disease emergence in order to set the scene for the more detailed chapters that follow. The chapter is divided into three parts. The first deals with the activities of humans that drive disease emergence. This ranges from historical factors such as animal domestication to the impact of new technologies such as air travel and agricultural intensification in response to population growth. The second section deals with virus properties that enable them to adapt to new hosts, particularly jumping between species. The final section deals with the activities of animals themselves that contribute to disease emergence.

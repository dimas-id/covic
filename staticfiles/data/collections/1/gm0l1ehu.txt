The nucleotide sequences of the spike precursor genes of infectious bronchitis virus strains M41 and 6/82 have been determined and compared with that of the Beaudette strain which we have previously sequenced. The two Massachusetts strains, M41 and Beaudette, were found to be remarkably similar, having only 3.7% of the amino acids different. The situation with 6/82, one of the new field isolates, is quite different and this strain had 13.8% of its amino acids different from Beaudette. The differences identified are discussed in terms of the structural features of the spike protein.

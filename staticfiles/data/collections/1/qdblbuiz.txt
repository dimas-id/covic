We theoretically analyze the ability of 3-dimensionally confined optofluidic ring resonators (OFRRs) for detection of a single nanoparticle in water and in air. The OFRR is based on a glass capillary, on which bottle-shaped and bubble-shaped ring resonators can form. The spectral position of the whispering gallery mode in the OFRR shifts when a nanoparticle is attached to the OFRR inner surface. For both ring resonator structures, the electric field at the inner surface can be optimized by choosing the right wall thickness. Meanwhile, different electric field confinement along the capillary longitudinal axis can be achieved with different curvatures. Both effects significantly increase the sensitivity of the ring resonator for single nanoparticle detection. It is found that the sensitivity is enhanced about 10 times, as compared to that of a solid microsphere biosensor recently reported, and that the smallest detectable nanoparticle is estimated to be less than 20 nm in radius for a Δλ/λ resolution of 10(-8). The high sensitivity and the naturally integrated capillary based microfluidics make the OFRR a very promising sensing platform for detection of various nano-sized bio/chemical species in liquid as well as in air.

INTRODUCTION As could be demonstrated for simple and radical nephrectomy, single-incision triangulated umbilical surgery (SITUS) is an interesting alternative to laparoscopic single-site surgery. We present our initial experience with the SITUS technique in radical cystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between September 2010 and September 2011, eight patients underwent SITUS radical cystectomy (SITUS Cx), pelvic lymph node dissection and extracorporeal urinary diversion. A cutaneous ureterostomy was performed in three, an ileum conduit in one and an ileal neobladder in four patients. Data were collected prospectively, including patients' characteristics, intraoperative parameters, pathological stage and postoperative outcome. RESULTS Mean age of the patients was 67 years and the mean body mass index 24 kg/m(2). SITUS Cx was successfully completed in all patients without conversion to conventional laparoscopic or open surgery. Mean surgical time was 434 min and mean estimated blood loss 643 ml. No major intra- or postoperative surgical complications occurred. All patients recovered quickly reporting low postoperative pain levels. Mean hospital stay was 16 (7-24 days). Histopathological evaluation revealed a mean of 16 (6-33) retrieved lymph nodes and no positive margins. CONCLUSION In the present experience, SITUS Cx proved to be feasible with surgical outcome comparable to conventional techniques. Because SITUS Cx combines the advantages of traditional laparoscopy (straight instruments and triangulation) with those of single-port surgery (superior cosmesis and minimal invasiveness), it presents an attractive alternative to other minimally invasive techniques.

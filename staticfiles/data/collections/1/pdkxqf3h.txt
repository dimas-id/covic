COVID‐19 has created the necessity to rapidly generate evidence to enlighten many blind spots encompassing the pandemic, from pathophysiology to management. Scientific journals have timely responded to this challenge by prioritizing COVID‐19 research, with proactive editorial efforts favoring open‐access to articles, launching calls for papers, implementing specific sections and special issues on COVID‐19, among others. However, the impact of all these measures on the overall quality and adequacy of research are largely unknown and several authors have shown concern in this regard.

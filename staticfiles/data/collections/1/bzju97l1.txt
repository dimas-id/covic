The 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study reported that lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, are the fourth most common cause of death globally. The etiology of acute bronchitis and asthma exacerbations is mostly viral and the therapy is symptomatic. Management decisions in community acquired pneumonia regarding site of care, extent of assessment, and level of treatment are based primarily on disease severity (outpatient, inpatient, ICU admission). Antibiotics are the main choice of treatment for patients with pneumonia, acute exacerbations (AE) of COPD (including increased sputum purulence and worsening shortness of breath) and AE of non-CF bronchiectasis. Inhaled antibiotics may represent a more optimal approach for the treatment and prevention of AE of non-CF bronchiectasis. Approved strategies for the prevention of exacerbations include smoking cessation and rehabilitation programs, drug therapy and vaccination.

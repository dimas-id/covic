A Translational Research Symposium was organized at the 2014 annual meeting of the European society for biomaterials. This brought together leading Tier one companies in clinical biomaterials and medical device markets, small and medium enterprises and entrepreneurial academics who shared their experiences on taking biomaterials technologies to commercial endpoints, in the clinics. The symposium focused on "Progressing Innovation in Biomaterials. From the Bench to the Bed of Patients". The aim of the present document is to illustrate the content of the symposium and to highlight the key lessons from selected lectures.

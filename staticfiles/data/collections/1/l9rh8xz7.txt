Comparisons were made between human enteric coronaviruses and the enteric coronaviruses of pigs and calves by negative staining. Examination of human intestinal organ culture fluids at various time intervals after inoculation with the human enteric coronavirus showed increasing numbers of particles in the fluids. Thin sections of the columnar epithelial cells of these explants showed a number of features consistent with the replication of known human and animal coronaviruses. Virus particles found in thin sections had a mean diameter of 68 nm. In addition, a structure was found in thin sections which has not been described previously. This structure may represent the viral nucleocapsid.

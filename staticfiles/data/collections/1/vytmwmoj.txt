Recently, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirius as a pandemic, and declared it as Public Health Emergency of International Concern. More than 6,83,536 positive cases and 32,139 deaths caused by coronavirus 2019 affecting 199 countries and territories. This pandemic can transform into an extremely destructive form if we still do not take it seriously. In this present study, we propose a generalized SEIR model of COVID-2019 to study the behavior of its transmission under different control strategies.

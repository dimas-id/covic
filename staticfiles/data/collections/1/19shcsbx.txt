The American Association for Respiratory Care has established a task force to identify potential new roles and responsibilities of respiratory therapists (RTs) in 2015 and beyond. The first task force conference confirmed that the healthcare system in the United States is on the verge of dramatic change, driven by the need to decrease costs and improve quality. Use of evidence-based protocols that follow a nationally accepted standard of practice, and application of biomedical innovation continue to be important competency areas for RTs. The goal of the second task force conference was to identify specific competencies needed to assure safe and effective execution of RT roles and responsibilities in the future. The education needed by the workforce to assume the new responsibilities emerging as the healthcare system changes starts with a close look at the competencies that will be needed by graduate RTs upon entry into practice. Future specialty practice areas for experienced RTs are identified without defining specific competencies. We present the findings of the task force on the competencies needed by graduate RTs upon entry into practice in 2015.

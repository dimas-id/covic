Infectious diseases continue to represent a significant threat to global health security, particularly in the context of increasing globalization, interconnectedness and interdependence. Chief among such threats are influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), because of their risk of high transmissibility and acuity of illness. Annual epidemics of seasonal influenza cause an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness and more than 500 000 deaths, with the prospect of pandemic influenza viruses causing far greater impact. In addition, the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, widespread and continued outbreaks of avian influenza A (H5N1) since 2004, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and emergence of MERS CoV in 2012 reflect the seriousness of public health challenges posed by influenza and emerging respiratory infections.

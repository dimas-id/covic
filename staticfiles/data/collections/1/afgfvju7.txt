BACKGROUND Iatrogenic injury to the vertebral artery is a rare but potential complication of cervical spine surgery. Previous authors have commented on the use of flow-diverting stents for treatment of aneurysms of the V3 segment of the vertebral artery. CASE DESCRIPTION Here, we report a case in which injury occurred at the V2 segment of the vertebral artery with the development of a pseudoaneurysm, which was found on angiography. After decompressing the spinal cord from an epidural hematoma, the pseudoaneurysm was treated by deploying two Pipeline flow-diverting stents (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm was noted on follow-up angiography 4 days after the treatment. CONCLUSION This case highlights a unique treatment at a region which, to our knowledge, has not been mentioned in the literature.

Abstract The microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) is linked to the nasopharyngeal commensal flora. This respiratory ecosystem undergoes various selective pressures, such as antibiotic consumption and vaccine use. Socio-economic conditions also influence the bacterial composition of the nasopharynx. Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and group A Streptococcus are the leading causes of bacterial AOM worldwide. This paper will discuss the causes and consequences of recent shifts in the underlying microbiology of AOM.

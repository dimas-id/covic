Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea and death in neonatal piglets. Passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies against PEDV is an effective prevention measure. In this study, single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies against PEDV were screened from the porcine scFv phage display library. After four rounds of biopanning, scFvs that showed higher affinity to the PEDV antigen were selected for further study. The scFv genes were cloned into the expression plasmid for recombinant protein expression. These scFvs were shown to inhibit PEDV infectivity by the plaque reduction neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that the epitopes recognized by these scFvs were in the S1 region of the spike protein. The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated. Piglets orally administered scFvs showed no to mild clinical symptoms, significantly less viral shedding, no mortality and no intestinal lesions. The field application also revealed that the survival rate of piglets was significantly increased by oral administration of scFvs. Our data support the potential role of scFvs in the prevention and treatment of PEDV infection.

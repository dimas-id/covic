The WHO considers that there is considerable danger of an influenza pandemic. One result of globalisation is that other highly contagious infectious diseases, such as SARS or Ebola, which are potentially endemic, can also be brought into Germany. Bioterorrism must also be considered. As well as all other medical disciplines, hospital surgical departments must be armed against this now. National pandemic planning will be taken as an example to illustrate the planning needed in hospitals to prepare for emergencies arising from infections in such specific situations.

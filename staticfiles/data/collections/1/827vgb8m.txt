BACKGROUND Several mutations have been described leading to impaired immunity in the IL-12/IFN-γ axis and, they confer susceptibility to mycobacterial infections. One of the more serious clinical phenotypes is secondary to mutations at IFN-γ receptor 1 gene, characterized by an early onset and more severe disease. CLINICAL REPORT We present a 3-month-old female patient with systemic M. tuberculosis complex who has a homozygous mutation, it affects the splicing site at IFNGR1 c.201-1G> T. At time of this report, she is with antimycobacterial treatment in the protocol of pluripotent hematopoietic cell transplantation (TCHP). CONCLUSION It has been reported that antiphimic treatment should be maintained until the immune system is restored by the TCHP. If patients receive THCP before the age of 1 year old, they have a better prognosis. Diminish the levels of IFN-γ in plasma before the procedure is associated to better results.

PURPOSE To explore the clinical and dynamic computed tomography features of coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS We enrolled 24 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 treated at a regional center in Dezhou, China, from January 22 to February 5, 2020, and analyzed data retrospectively. RESULTS Nineteen cases had close contact with people with coronavirus disease 2019, and five patients denied a travel history in Wuhan City or contact with patients having coronavirus disease 2019. Symptoms were fever, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, fatigue, and muscle pain. Chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities distributed along peribronchial bundles and subpleural areas, often accompanied by bronchiectasis, vascular thickening, and interlobular septal thickening after coronavirus disease 2019 progression. CONCLUSIONS Coronavirus disease 2019 has certain clinical characteristics and typical computed tomography features.

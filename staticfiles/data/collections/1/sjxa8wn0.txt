Abstract The distribution of FCoV Types I and II in a Portuguese cat population was studied by a RT-PCR assay targeting the 3â€²-end of the viral RNA. For a period of 3 years, 120 samples were collected and 57 were found positive for FCoV RNA. Within the positive samples the presence of FCoV Type I was found in 79%. Type II was only detected in 3.5% in animals with Feline Infectious Peritonitis. The remaining 17.5% could not be differentiated. These viral sequences, comprising a region within gene S were further subjected to a heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) detecting the presence of viral quasispecies in 17% of the samples. Phylogenetic analysis for FCoV Type I revealed high genetic diversity between the Portuguese sequences and other previously characterized strains, while Type II tree showed a higher genetic homogeneity. This study confirmed the presence of FCoV Types I and II circulating in Portugal and detected high genetic diversity between circulating strains suggesting that the virus persists within the host as mixed viral populations.

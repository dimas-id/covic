BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In clinical practice, stent diameter is one of the variable properties important for endovascular treatment. A consensus guideline for stent retriever size selection has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different diameters of Solitaire retrievers on outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 628 patients enrolled from the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Anterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke Registry, 256 were treated with the Solitaire 4-mm device and 372, with the 6-mm device. We matched patients treated with the 2 stent sizes using propensity score analysis. The successful outcome was reperfusion as measured by the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score immediately postprocedure and the dichotomized modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and in-hospital mortality were also recorded. RESULTS After propensity score analysis, group outcomes did not differ. In addition, in patients with atherosclerosis-related occlusion, a higher reperfusion rate (P = .021) was observed in the Solitaire 4 group, as well as a shorter time interval (P = .002) and fewer passes (P = .025). Independent predictors of successful reperfusion in patients with atherosclerotic disease on logistic analysis were the small stent (OR, 3.217; 95% CI, 1.129-9.162; P = .029) and the propensity score acting as a covariate (OR, 52.84; 95% CI, 3.468-805.018; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence of a differential effect of intra-arterial therapy based on the size of Solitaire retrievers. In patients with atherosclerotic disease, favorable reperfusion was associated with deployment of a small stent.

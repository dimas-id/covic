An 87-year-old man with primary salivary duct carcinoma and hepatic metastases was referred for restaging. (18)F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated new FDG-avid ground-glass opacities with intralobular septal thickening in both lungs with a peripheral dominant distribution. This was interpreted as a pattern highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the referring physician was contacted. The patient was currently asymptomatic and without clinical evidence of active pneumonia. However, the patient tested positive for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction. This case demonstrates that even asymptomatic outpatients undergoing PET/CT should be evaluated for radiologic findings suggestive of COVID-19 during this pandemic.

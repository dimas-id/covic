In New Zealand we have been far less affected by Covid-19 than many other countries. To put our discussion in some context at the time of writing (May 10 2020) in a country of nearly 5 million people, we have had 1144 cases of Covid-19 with 1,371 people recovered and 21 deaths. At the same time the United Kingdom has had 215,000 cases and 31,587 deaths; and the USA has had 1,034,000 cases and 79,696 deaths. While our case numbers have not been particularly high the government's response has been to institute four types of lockdown.

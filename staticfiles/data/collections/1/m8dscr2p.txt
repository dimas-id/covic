BACKGROUND Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become the standard procedure for treating patents with adrenal masses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of the LigaSure vessel closure system during laparoscopic adrenalectomy. METHODS The LigaSure device was used in 32 patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal masses. Adrenalectomy was carried out without the use of clips or sutures for vessel closure. In 1 patient the adrenal tumor had invaded the ipsilateral kidney, so laparoscopic nephrectomy was also carried out during the same operation. In another patient, a renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney had metastasized to the right adrenal gland. Both the kidney and the contralateral adrenal gland were removed laparoscopically during the same operation. RESULTS Adrenal masses had a mean greatest diameter of 3.48 cm (range 2 to 11 cm). Mean operative time was 83.2 minutes (range 30 to 190 min). Mean blood loss was 36.2 mL (range 10 to 140 mL). No conversions to open surgery were necessary. No patients experienced major bleeding intraoperatively or postoperatively. Adrenal tumor types included adrenocortical adenoma (16 patients), pheochromocytoma (13 patients), malignant pheochromocytoma (1 patient), chromophobic carcinoma (1 patient), and metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS For vessel closure during laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the LigaSure device seems to be safe and effective. For patients with conditions such as renal cell carcinoma combined with metastasis to the contralateral adrenal gland, nephrectomy, and contralateral adrenalectomy can be carried out during the same laparoscopic operation.

The present study aimed to review the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and future perspectives related to COVID-19 infections. The following electronic databases were used searched: MEDLINE, SCIELO, and LILACS. It became clear that COVID-19 infections occur through exposure to the virus, and both the immunosuppressed and healthy population appear susceptible. The clinical course of COVID-19 is still not clear, although the SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to develop with mild, influenza-like symptoms in the vast majority of subjects, i.e., 10%-15% of COVID-19 patients. Since rRT-PCR tests serve as the gold standard method to confirm a SARS-CoV-2 infection, false-negative results could hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, particularly considering the test plays a key role in the decision for continued isolated medical observation or discharge. Our findings also indicate that a radical increase in the identification and isolation of currently undocumented infections would be needed to fully control SARS-CoV2.

We describe a boy who developed autoinflammatory (chronic sterile multifocal osteomyelitis) and autoimmune (autoimmune cytopenias; vitiligo) phenotypes who subsequently developed disseminated granulomatous disease. Whole exome sequencing revealed homozygous RAG1 mutations thus expanding the spectrum of combined immunodeficiency with autoimmunity and granuloma that can occur with RAG deficiency.

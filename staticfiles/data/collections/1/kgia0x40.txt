BACKGROUND Endovascular interventions are increasingly utilized in managing occlusive peripheral vascular disease. Angioplasty and stenting remain the mainstay of endovascular management; however, newer treatment modalities such as excisional atherectomy provide the clinician with additional treatment options. While demonstrating promising results in available trials, a paucity of data exist regarding peripheral atherectomy. The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to assess the efficacy and safety of excisional atherectomy with the TurboHawk atherectomy device (Covidien/ev3, Plymouth, MN, USA) in the treatment of lower limb peripheral vascular disease and to evaluate the learning curve involved in the institution of a new treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients undergoing atherectomy for symptomatic lower limb peripheral vascular disease by a single clinician between November 2011 and June 2013. Forty-seven vessels on 28 legs in 24 patients were treated during the period. RESULTS Atherectomy was possible in 98% of cases. The 6- and 12-month primary patency was 72.6 and 58.9%, respectively. The primary-assisted patency was 93.2% at 6 months and 74.6% at 12 months. There were significantly greater patency rates in the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A + B lesions and a non-significant trend towards improved patency rates in claudicants versus critical limb ischaemia. There were four instances of embolization and four cases of dissection. CONCLUSION Excisional atherectomy provides a further option for the minimally invasive management of peripheral vascular disease. It has similar patency rates to established endovascular therapies and should be considered among the treatment options in patients with favourable pathology.

Influenza A and B viruses cause significant human disease worldwide through regular outbreaks and epidemics of seasonal influenza, and occasional pandemics when a novel influenza A virus emerges. Whereas Australia and New Zealand have well-established systems for community and laboratory-based surveillance of influenza, most other countries of the Pacific are only beginning to develop such systems with the support of various global and regional agencies and networks. Here we describe the role of the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance Network and other organizations in laboratory-based influenza surveillance in the region and review some of the available data on seasonal and pandemic influenza in the developed and developing countries of the Pacific. The particular features of the Pacific Island countries and territories as small dispersed island communities, together with the greater susceptibility of indigenous people to the severe effects of influenza, highlight the importance of developing local laboratory-based surveillance systems. Such systems will improve the understanding, detection and control of seasonal influenza while also providing early warning of the emergence of potential pandemic viruses.

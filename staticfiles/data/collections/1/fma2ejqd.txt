Menangle virus (MenPV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus capable of causing disease in pigs and humans. It was first isolated in 1997 from stillborn piglets at a commercial piggery in New South Wales, Australia, where an outbreak of reproductive disease occurred. Neutralizing antibodies to MenPV were detected in various pteropid bat species in Australia and fruit bats were suspected to be the source of the virus responsible for the outbreak in pigs. However, previous attempts to isolate MenPV from various fruit bat species proved fruitless. Here, we report the isolation of MenPV from urine samples of the black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, using a combination of improved procedures and newly established bat cell lines. The nucleotide sequence of the bat isolate is 94 % identical to the pig isolate. This finding provides strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that the MenPV outbreak in pigs originated from viruses in bats roosting near the piggery.

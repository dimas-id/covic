BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of fast-track hospitalizations in a selected cohort of patients with stroke. METHODS Patients hospitalized at the Stroke Center of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, with an acute ischaemic stroke confirmed on magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging were included. Neurological deficits of the included patients were non-disabling, i.e. not interfering with activities of daily living and compatible with a direct discharge home. Patients with premorbid disability were excluded. All patients were admitted to the Stroke Center for ≥24 h. Two study groups were compared - fast-track hospitalizations (≤72 h) and long-term hospitalizations (>72 h). The primary end-point was a composite of any unplanned rehospitalization for any reason within 3 months since hospital discharge and a modified Rankin Scale 3-6 at 3 months. Adjustment for confounders was done using the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW). RESULTS Amongst the 521 patients who met the inclusion criteria, fast-track hospitalizations were performed in 79 patients (15%). In the fast-track group, seven patients (8.9%) met the primary end-point, compared to 37 (8.4%) in the long-term group [odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-2.34, P = 0.88]. After weighting for IPTW, the odds of the primary end-point remained similar between the two arms (ORIPTW 1.27, 95% CI 0.51-3.16, P = 0.61). The costs of fast-track hospitalizations were lower, on average, by $4994. CONCLUSIONS Fast-track hospitalizations including a full workup proved to be feasible, showed no increased risk and were less expensive than long-term hospitalizations.

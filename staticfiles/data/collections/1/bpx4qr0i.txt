Background: The increasing importance of software for the conduct of various types of research raises the necessity of proper testing to ensure correctness. The unique characteristics of the research software produce challenges in the testing process that require attention. Aims: Therefore, the goal of this paper is to share the experience of implementing a testing framework using a statistical approach for a specific type of research software, i.e. non-deterministic software. Method: Using the ParSplice research software project as a case, we implemented a testing framework based on a statistical testing approach called Multinomial Test. Results: Using the new framework, we were able to test the ParSplice project and demonstrate correctness in a situation where traditional methodical testing approaches were not feasible. Conclusions: This study opens up the possibilities of using statistical testing approaches for research software that can overcome some of the inherent challenges involved in testing non-deterministic research software.

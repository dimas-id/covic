The role of respiratory viruses in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has not been extensively investigated. The objective was to study the implication of respiratory viruses in HIV patients with CAP, through a prospective, three-year study in a third-level hospital. Respiratory viruses were implicated in 14 of the 67 cases of CAP diagnosed and were the only microorganism isolated in 8 of them. Evolution of the disease was similar in patients with CAP associated with respiratory virus infection and those with CAP alone. Respiratory virus infection in HIV-infected patients with CAP is not associated with a poorer prognosis.

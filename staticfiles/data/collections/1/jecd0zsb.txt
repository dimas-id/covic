The first step of any maize transformation project is to select gene expression elements that will make up an effective construct. When designing a gene construct, one must have a full understanding of the different expression elements that are currently available and of the strategies that have been successfully used to overcome obstacles in past. In this chapter, we discuss several major classes of expression elements that have been used for maize transformation, including promoters, introns, and untranslated regions. We also discuss several strategies for further improving transgene expression levels, such as optimization of codon usage, removal of deleterious sequences, addition of signal sequences for subcellular protein targeting, and use of elements to reduce position effects. We hope that this chapter can serve as a general guideline to help researchers, especially beginners in the field, to design a gene construct that will have the maximum potential for gene expression.

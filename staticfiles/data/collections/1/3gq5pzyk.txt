OBJECTIVES: The treatment paradigm in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) is evolving towards individualized, risk-directed and longer duration of therapy (DOT). The objective of this study was to describe treatment patterns and outcomes in non-transplant NDMM in four European countries. METHODS: This retrospective chart review included adults with NDMM diagnosed between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013 (early cohort) or April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 (recent cohort). RESULTS: Among 836 patients, molecular testing was performed in 21% and 35% patients of early vs. recent cohorts; proteasome inhibitor (PI)/alkylator combinations were the principal first-line (1L) therapy (39% vs. 43%). Use of immunomodulatory drug (IMID)/alkylator combinations declined from early to recent cohort (26% vs. 13%) but IMID (7% vs. 16%) use increased. Few patients (5%) received 1L maintenance therapy. Two-thirds of patients were treated with a fixed duration intent, with a median 7-month 1L DOT and progression-free survival (PFS) of 32.8 months in the early cohort. Both 1L DOT and PFS were longer with oral compared to injectable regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Although frontline treatment patterns changed significantly, 1L DOT is short. The uptake of molecular testing and 1L maintenance is low. These results highlight areas of unmet need in NDMM.

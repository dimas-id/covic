Transmission of viruses from one species to another is not unusual in nature. Despite this, evolutionarily successful transmissions are rare. Such events can cause pandemics and are followed by hostâ€“virus coevolution procedures that can increase the fitness potential of viruses. In this perspective article, I recognize eight main types of trans-species viral transmission. I consider two of them as evolutionarily successful, explaining why coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 could be one of them.

PURPOSE To report clinical performance and longitudinal assessment of hemodialysis adequacy with the Arrow-Clark VectorFlow catheter, a symmetrical-tip device with a distal lumen configuration designed to reduce platelet shear stress and catheter thrombosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS We prospectively enrolled patients who required de novo placement of a chronic tunneled catheter for hemodialysis or exchange of a dysfunctional catheter as part of an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. Catheter patency, Kt/V, mean blood-flow (Qb), and pump pressures were obtained at baseline and at monthly intervals to 90 days. RESULTS Forty-six subjects were enrolled into the study. During the 90-day observation period, maximum blood-flow rate averaged 355-398 mL/minute; mean Qb averaged 333-392 mL/minute. Mean Kt/V values were consistently ≥1.5. Dwell-time was 15-114 days, for a total of 2997 catheter days (mean 71.4 days). Excluding patients who died during the study and those receiving surgical access, overall intervention-free catheter patency rate was 94.9%, 92.2% and 88.8% at days 30, 60, 90, respectively. There were no acute complications. During the follow-up period, three patients developed complications (6.5%). Two catheter infections occurred (0.7/1000 catheter days) and one catheter malfunctioned; a rate of 1.0/ 1000 catheter days for all complications. CONCLUSIONS The VectorFlow catheter produced safe, effective hemodialysis with Kt/V ≥1.5. A single catheter occlusion occurred and a low rate of infection was seen. Results support the hypothesis that the VectorFlow design reduces thrombogenic risk during clinical performance.

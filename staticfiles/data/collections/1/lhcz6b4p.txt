Perhaps the greatest barrier to adoption of laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy by experienced pancreatic surgeons is the technical challenge of constructing the pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ). The authors present a less demanding PJ technique they have developed that creates an end-to-end intussuscepting anastomosis using a running monofilament suture. This method reduces technical complexity and operative time while producing acceptably comparable outcomes.

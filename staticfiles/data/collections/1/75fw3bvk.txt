BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy, additional retriever passes may increase the likelihood of recanalization, but also the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This multicenter retrospective register study aimed to evaluate the impact of retriever passes on treatment efficacy and safety outcomes in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with ischemic stroke due to large artery occlusion in anterior circulation and treated with mechanical thrombectomy were enrolled. The primary efficacy outcome was a favorable functional outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. Major safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) and mortality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the impact of retriever passes on efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS Of the 472 enrolled patients, the likelihood of favorable outcome declined in patients with more than three retriever passes (44.4% in patients with three passes, 26.3% with four passes, 14.8% with five or more passes). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three or less passes as an independent predictor for favorable functional outcomes (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.10-5.45, P = 0.029). More than three passes was associated with an increased risk of SICH (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.16-4.33, P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS More than three retriever passes may increase the rate of recanalization, but not the likelihood of favorable functional outcomes in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Notably, multiple retriever passes may also increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE Level of Evidence: Level 4, Case Series.

Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.

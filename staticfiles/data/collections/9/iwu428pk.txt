MERS-CoV usually causes respiratory and renal failure in some patients, which may be the underlying cause of death. Dromedary camels are the only known reservoir of the virus until now. They shed the virus in their body secretions thus potentiate a risk for human infection. MERS-CoV tropism and replication is mainly affected by the presence of certain receptor ligands on the target tissues. The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is believed to act as receptors for MERS-CoV. The main objective of this study was to determine the expression levels of the DPP-4 in various organs of some naturally infected camels. We conducted a surveillance study to identify some positive MERS-CoV infected camels. Three positive animals identified by the Real time PCR. Our results are clearly showing the high level of expression of the DPP-4 in various organs of these animalsâ€™ particularly nasal turbinate, trachea, and lungs. The expression level may explain at least in part the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in these organs. These findings confirm the pivotal roles of the DPP4 in the context of the MER-CoV infection in dromedary camels. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MER-CoV infection.

Whole-sediment toxicity assays contribute to elucidating the intricate association between the presence of contaminants in sediments and their toxicopathic effects in benthic fish. In the present study, Solea senegalensis juveniles were exposed under laboratory conditions to contaminated whole-sediments for 7 and 28 days. Sediments were obtained from a low to moderately polluted estuary, a highly polluted harbour and from the mixture of both field-collected sediments. Biometry data were recorded. Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour's sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour's sediment. The Integrative Biomarker Response index (IBR/n) evidenced that exposure to the three sediments caused an impact of diverse magnitude in sole health (IBR/nHarbour > IBR/nMixture > IBR/nEstuary). The magnitude of biological responses essentially depended on the presence of contaminants in source sediments, which seemed to be altered by the conditions imposed by whole-sediment toxicity assays.

Genomics tools allow us to assess gene expression ‘genome wide’ providing an unprecedented view on the host-side of the virus–host interaction. The success of the application of these tools crucially depends on our ability to reduce the total information load while increasing the information density of the data collected. In addition to the advanced data analysis algorithms, gene annotation-pathway databases, and theoretical models, specifically designed sets of complementary experiments are crucial in translating the collected genomics data into palatable knowledge. A better understanding of the molecular basis of virus–host interactions will support the rational design of improved and novel intervention strategies for viral infections.

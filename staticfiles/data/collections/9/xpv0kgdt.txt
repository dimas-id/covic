This review will focus on the infectious etiologies and more common noninfectious causes of lower respiratory tract syndromes among major immunosuppressed populations. The changing epidemiology of infections in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the case of HIV-positive patients and the impacts of both newer immune-suppressant therapies and anti-infective prophylaxis for other immunocompromised hosts will be discussed, with emphasis on diagnostic approaches and practice algorithms.

Abstract The pollutant behavior in and around a naturally ventilated building requires to be investigated quantitatively as the growing concern on air quality within the built environment. The objective of the present study is to further investigate the wind induced inter-flat pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings in Shanghai. In this paper, a set of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 reduced scale model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was employed as a tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. Two natural ventilation modes, single-sided ventilation and cross ventilation were considered. The conditions under prevailing wind direction with different source locations on the windward side were compared. The pressure coefficients on all of the building façades and tracer gas concentration distributions were monitored and analysed. The experimental results elucidated that contaminant released from windward units could spread vertically and horizontally to other units on the source façade and downstream units. The source location was a significant influence factor on the pollutant concentration in various units. In the single-sided ventilated building, the infected risks of leeward units were even higher than those in some windward units. In the cross ventilated building, the vertical transmission could be suppressed and the horizontal transmission was reinforced. The study is helpful for further understanding of the inter-flat airborne transmission within an isolated building.

Upper respiratory infections (URIs) are extremely common in adults. Most adults have multiple URIs each year, with athletes being more or less susceptible, depending on training intensity. Most URIs are viral nasopharyngeal infections that will improve in 7 to 10 days with symptomatic treatment and result in little time lost from athletic participation. Physicians must recognize the symptoms consistent with bacterial pharyngitis, infectious mononucleosis, and sinusitis to provide appropriate diagnostic testing, treatment, and return-to-play recommendations.

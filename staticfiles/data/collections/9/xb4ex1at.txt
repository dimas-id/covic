The relationship between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2))-if better defined-could facilitate the difficult task of ventilation in prehospital trauma patients. We aimed to study the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) relationship before, during, and after chest trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation in swine. Twenty-four swine were intubated, anesthetized, and monitored in an animal intensive care unit during three phases: phase 1 (day 1, healthy animals); phase 2 (day 2, injury), which consisted of blunt chest trauma, hemorrhage, and resuscitation; and phase 3 (day 2, after injury). "Respiratory maneuvers" (changes in respiratory rate and tidal volume [TV], intended to vary the PaCO(2) over a range of 25 to 85 mmHg, were performed during phases 1 and 3. End-tidal CO(2) and PaCO(2) were recorded after each respiratory maneuver and analyzed using linear regression. During phase 1, PaCO(2) and EtCO(2) were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.01). During phase 2, animals developed decreased oxygenation (PaO(2):FiO(2) [fraction of inspired oxygen] ratio <200) and hypotension (mean arterial pressure, 20-50 mmHg); the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) relationship deteriorated (r(2) = 0.25, P < 0.0001). During phase 3, oxygenation, hemodynamics, and the PaCO(2)-EtCO(2) relationship recovered (r(2) = 0.92, P < 0.01). End-tidal CO(2) closely correlates to PaCO(2) in healthy animals and after injury/resuscitation across a wide range of respiratory rates and tidal volumes. Once oxygenation and hemodynamics are restored, EtCO(2) can be used to predict PaCO(2) following chest trauma/hemorrhage and should be considered for patient monitoring. This work demonstrated that EtCO(2) alone can reliably be used to estimate PaCO(2) in uninjured subjects and in those subjects who have been resuscitated from severe injury. Immediately after blunt chest injury, the correlation between EtCO(2) and PaCO(2) is temporarily unstable. Under these circumstances (with abnormal oxygenation and/or hemodynamics), greater caution and other monitoring tools may be required.

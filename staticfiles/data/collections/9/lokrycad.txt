BACKGROUND Our purpose was to compare the recurrence rate and other clinical outcomes of laparoscopic (LS) transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) for mesh fixation with those of no mesh fixation and mesh fixation with titanium spiral tacks (ST). METHODS The medical records of patients who received LS TAPP inguinal hernia repair between 2009 and 2012 at our institution were reviewed. Patients were included if the received LS TAPP with either no mesh fixation, mesh fixation with NBCA only, fixation with ST only, or fixation with NBCA + ST. Outcome measures were operation time, postoperative length of stay, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score 24 h after surgery, postoperative complications, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS A total of 1,027 TAPP cases were included. In 552 cases, meshes were fixed with NBCA only, in 89 cases only ST were used, in 47 cases ST and NBCA were used, and in 339 cases meshes were not fixed. The groups were comparable with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics. No surgical complications occurred in any group. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the nonfixation and NBCA only groups (1.4 ± 0.6 and 1.3 ± 0.6, respectively) than in the ST and NBCA + ST groups (2.2 ± 0.9 and 2.2 ± 0.7, respectively; P = 0.001). The mean follow-up duration was ~19 months. At the final follow-up, no wound infections or hernia recurrences had occurred in any of the groups. No occurrence of chronic pain was noted in the nonfixation and NBCA only groups, whereas two cases (2.2%) were noted in the ST group and one case (2.1%) in the NBCA + ST group (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS The use of NBCA medical adhesive for noninvasive patch fixation in laparoscopic hernia repair (TAPP) is effective and safe.

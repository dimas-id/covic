BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of 3 portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) to maintain S(pO2) ≥ 90% during exercise in patients with chronic lung disease. METHODS Twenty-one subjects with chronic lung disease (18 with COPD, 3 with pulmonary fibrosis) and documented room air exertional S(pO2) ≤ 85% performed four 6-min walk tests: a control walk using the subject's current oxygen system and prescribed exertional flow rate, and 1 walk with each of the 3 POCs (Eclipse 3, EverGo, and iGo) at their maximum pulse-dose setting. RESULTS S(pO2) was significantly higher pre-walk and post-walk with the Eclipse 3, compared to the other POCs (all P < .01). The subjects also walked farther and maintained a mean S(pO2) ≥ 90% with the Eclipse 3 (both P < .01), which delivers the largest oxygen bolus. The subjects indicated that they preferred the EverGo's physical characteristics, but that the Eclipse 3 responded best to their breathing. The iGo was rated less favorably than Eclipse 3 or EverGo. CONCLUSIONS The Eclipse 3 was best at meeting the subjects' clinical needs. POC users should be appropriately tested during all activities of daily living, to ensure adequate oxygenation. The healthcare provider should provide information and help to direct the subject toward the most clinically appropriate oxygen system, while being mindful of the patient's preferences and lifestyle.

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is known to be associated with a risk of gastric staple line leak. We report on our experience with endoscopic stenting of the anomalous leaking tract. Three cases of post sleeve gastric leak confirmed by computed tomography scan were treated by endoscopic stenting of their leak with a plastic endoprosthesis under fluoroscopic and endoscopic guidance. Endoscopic stenting by means of biliary or pancreatic endoprosthesis was successful in the three patients. The median number of endoscopy procedures per patient was 1.3. Stents were extracted 6 to 10 weeks after their placement. Neither morbidity nor recurrence was noticed on follow-up. Endoscopic stenting of gastric staple line leak following sleeve gastrectomy proved to be an efficacious technique for leak healing.

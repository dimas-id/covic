Various herb products derived from plants have potent biological effects including anticancer activity. In the present study, the antitumor activity of a herbal product derived from the Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis) was examined, using in vitro assays in a human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line. Results showed that S. baicalensis root extract at the concentration of 100 Î¼g/ml inhibited monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth in human OSCC cell lines, while not affecting the adhering abilities of cells. This suggested that it did not alter the expression of any of the adhesion receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The S. baicalensis root extract demonstrated potent cytostatic and apoptotic effects due to the downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression and its partner cyclin D1, resulting in G1 arrest and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, the S. baicalensis root extract was found to have blocked vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced migration and tube formation in human endothelial cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that as a herbal product, the S. baicalensis root extract is a potential inhibitor of tumori- and angiogenesis and may be valuable in the development of pharmaceutical medications for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

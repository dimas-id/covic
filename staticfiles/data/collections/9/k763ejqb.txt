The treatment of gynecological cancers is the main activity of brachytherapy units. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, precautions should be done in order to reduce the spread of the virus while maintaining all chances to recovery for all patients (Radiother Oncol 148, 227-228, 2020). Despite the extent of the pandemic in our country, limited data are available to establish recommendations with a sufficient level of evidence (Radiother Oncol 148, 227-228, 2020). More recently, the American Brachytherapy Society published some clarifications in this regard and international expert consensus recommendations of radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic were published (https://www.americanbrachytherapy.org/about-abs/abs-news/abs-statement-on-coronavirus/, Gynecol Oncol 15, 2020). In this commentary, we sought to share the procedures adopted for the management of gynecological cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic in our brachytherapy unit.

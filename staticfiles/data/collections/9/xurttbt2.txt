An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a detergent-solubilized antigen of purified virus was developed for detection of antibody against porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus in swine serum. The ELISA demonstrated antibody responses in pigs immunized intramuscularly with the attenuated TO-163 strain of TGE virus and in pigs orally infected with the virulent Shizuoka strain of the virus. The results of the ELISA were well correlated with those of the neutralization test. These results indicate the usefulness of the ELISA as a serological tool for TGE virus antibody.

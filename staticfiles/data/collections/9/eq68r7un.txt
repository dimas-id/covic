Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) has been in use for nearly 100 years and is the only licensed TB vaccine. While BCG provides protection against disseminated TB in infants, its protection against adult pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is variable. To achieve the ambitious goal of eradicating TB worldwide by 2050, there is an urgent need to develop novel TB vaccines. Currently, there are more than a dozen novel TB vaccines including prophylactic and therapeutic at different stages of clinical research. This literature review provides an overview of the clinical status of candidate TB vaccines and discusses the challenges and future development trends of novel TB vaccine research in combination with the efficacy of evaluation of TB vaccines, provides insight for the development of safer and more efficient vaccines, and may inspire new ideas for the prevention of TB.

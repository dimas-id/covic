Abstract Herein, we report that nosocomial infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be mitigated by using surgical masks and closed looped ventilation for both non-critical and critical patients. These preventive measures resulted in no viral contamination of surfaces in negative pressure environments.

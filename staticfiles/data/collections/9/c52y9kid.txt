Boot camp style courses for graduating students provide intensive, timely training to help improve and polish clinical and communication skills before transitioning to the intern role. At our institution, we offer an annual two-week pediatric boot camp elective for graduating medical students entering into pediatric residencies each spring that uses a combination of simulation, patient encounters and classroom-based sessions. However, medical students graduating in 2020 were removed from all patient care activities for their final quarter because of the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting many planned "just in time" experiences.

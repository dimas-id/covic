In the first step of the E2E M&A Process Design, the Embedded M&A Strategy aligned with the overarching corporate and SBU strategies was defined. Based on this framework of the Embedded M&A Strategy a distinguished shortlist of suitable M&A targets with a strong financial, strategic, Business and Culture Design fit have been distilled. The Transaction Management, as the follow-on module of the E2E M&A Process Design, is focused on a specific transaction with a selected target company or merger partner. Core parts of the Transaction Management are the valuation of the target company (Standalone Value) and the potential synergies (Integrated Value), the Due Diligence of the target company which should identify the risks and upsides of the potential transaction, as well as the blending of the Standalone Business and Culture Designs and the Redrafting of the Joint Culture and Business Designs according to the Due Diligence outcomes. Supplementary parts of the Transaction Management as the negotiation of a share or asset purchase agreement, the acquisition financing, and the Purchase Price Allocation (PPA), will be not discussed in detail. (These parts will be incorporated in the second edition).

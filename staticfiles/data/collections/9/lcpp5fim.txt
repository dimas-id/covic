The avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) typically infects the respiratory tract of chickens, but can also spread to other organs. However, the mechanisms of virus dissemination are presently unclear. We show that peripheral blood-derived monocytes/macrophages from chickens (chPBMC) are productively infected by clinical strains of IBV, accompanied by induction of apoptosis. Our data suggest that chPBMCs play a role in the dissemination of IBV, and may be important for viral pathogenesis.

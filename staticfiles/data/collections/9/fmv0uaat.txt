OBJECTIVE to discuss the application of Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice for attire and unattire training in the context of COVID-19 and structure a practical guide to the application at this juncture. METHODS this methodological study described theoretical and practical aspects of the application of a simulation strategy as a technological training tool. An application guide was constructed from the search for evidence from the main health authority bodies in Brazil. RESULTS maximizing time in Deliberate Practice, feedback with evidence and psychological security are the principles of this strategy. The dynamic involves repetition and feedback. The application guide presents the sequence of actions for attire and unattire. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS coping with this pandemic requires appropriate use of personal protective equipment. The authors suggest the Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice as a technological educational tool for attire/unattire, since it encourages mastery performance.

Surveillance cultures are the only cultures that allow the distinction between secondary endogenous and exogenous infections. These types of infection are the two known to cause outbreaks. Secondary endogenous infections can be controlled by enterally administered antimicrobials and should be integrated into the routine infection control measures. Exogenous infections can be controlled by topically applied antimicrobials and hygiene.

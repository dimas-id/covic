The recent emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been rapidly and widely spread and causing an ongoing viral pneumonia outbreak worldwide. It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rather long and asymptomatic incubation time. We characterized the abilities to induce and to response to IFNβ/IFNλ1 of two or our clinical isolates, SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020, which exhibit only two amino acid differences over the ∼30kb viral genome. We found that both isolates may infect Huh7, A549 and Calu-3 cells, yet the RIG-I-like receptor-dependent antiviral signaling was poorly induced in these cells in the early infections. Unexpectedly, we found that the intracellular vRNA levels of these isolates were sustained upon to type I/III IFN treatments, and this phenotype was more pronounced in the Taiwan/NTU01/2020 isolate. The type I/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions. With better understandings of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host antiviral innate immunity, our report may provide new insights for the regimen of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

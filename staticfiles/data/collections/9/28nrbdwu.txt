Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has rapidly evolved into the technique of choice compared with open splenectomy (OS) because of the advantages of the minimally invasive approach. Splenomegaly increases the technical difficulties of LS. LS for massive splenomegaly has generally been found to fail in adults and children. With improvements in laparoscopic technique and accumulation of laparoscopic experience, however, concerns about completing the procedure in pediatric cases with even massive splenomegaly have been lowered. A retrospective review (April 1997-October 2009) of databases at 2 institutions identified 145 children undergoing splenectomy, 79 laparoscopic and 66 open. We defined splenic margin below the umbilicus or anteriorly extending over the midline as massive splenomegaly. By this definition, 22 cases of pediatric laparoscopic and 17 cases of open splenectomies for massive splenomegaly were performed. Perioperative and follow-up data of laparoscopic pediatric splenectomies were compared with those of open splenectomies, including operative time, bleeding, spleen size, complications, and hospital stay. There were no deaths, wound infections, or instances of pancreatitis. No accessory spleen was missed by laparoscopic; accessory spleens were missed in 2 patients in open splenectomies. The complication rate of laparoscopic versus open was 13.6% versus 41.2%. No subsequent surgery was necessary for dealing with complications both in laparoscopic and open series. Laparoscopic pediatric splenectomy for massive splenomegaly is a feasible, effective, and safe procedure and is associated with low morbidity and a short hospital stay.

The COVID‐19 pandemic impact on children is a growing concern. The United Nations and its agencies (the World Health Organization and UNICEF), Indian Association For Child and Adolescent Mental Health and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience in India warn about the broader impacts on children and call for urgent action to support the world’s children amidst the pandemic which may have lasting consequences. The COVID‐19 pandemic and unprecedented control measures to prevent its spread have disrupted nearly every aspect of children’s lives – their health, development, learning, behaviour and their families’ economic security, including protection from violence and abuse. Given this background, there is an urgent need for action through screening to minimize the mental health issues of children in India who constitute a substantial proportion of the population.

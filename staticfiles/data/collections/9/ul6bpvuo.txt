Data was extracted and exported to Covidence software for screening and removal of duplicates. Results The search revealed a total of 492 documents from Scopus (n = 95), Pubmed (n = 220) and CINAHL (n = 177). Random effects model was used as there was a high degree of heterogeneity was seen among the studies published (I2 = 99.62%). A total of 74 publications were included in the analysis of the pooled prevalence of root caries which yielded a prevalence of 41.5 (36.9-46.1).

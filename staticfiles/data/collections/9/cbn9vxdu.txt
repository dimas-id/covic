OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical features and therapy experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS From December 2002 to April 2003 in Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, 38 patients with severe SARS were retrospectively studied to evaluate the relationship between treatment strategy and prognosis. RESULTS Thirty-eight cases of severe SARS were diagnosed. Comprehensive measures most commonly included corticosteroids, antibiotics, antivirotics, nutritional support and mechanical ventilation. Thirty cases were cured (78.9%), of them 11 cases had pulmonary fibrosis (36.7%), 8 patients died (21.1%) in all cases. CONCLUSION Severe SARS might develop rapidly. In addition to early diagnosis, prompt isolation, and emergency therapy, appropriate use of corticosteroid and noninvasive ventilation should be recommended.

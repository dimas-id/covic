Pneumonia remains one of the most common reasons for admission of emergency department (ED) patients to the hospital. Pneumonia also remains one of the most common causes of death in our patients. As with many emergent conditions, the ED management of these patients initiated by ED physicians contributes greatly to the survival and successful management of these patients. Specifically, the recognition of severe pneumonias, precise choice of diagnostic tests, and appropriate antibiotics can have an impact on the outcome.

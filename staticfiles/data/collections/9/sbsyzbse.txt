In this letter we discuss the proposition of Bristian BR (2020) to use the intravenous administration of fish oil emulsions in critically ill COVID‐19. We consider that immune modulatory properties of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, rapidly provided in high amounts by fish oil emulsion, may be important to change the course of COVID‐19's death pathway. Prescriptions should be based on body weight (e.g. 0.2 g pure FOLE/kg body weight/day) and also should consider combining the parenteral administration of fish oil emulsion to low oral aspirin intake, in order to trigger resolvin synthesis from EPA and DHA.

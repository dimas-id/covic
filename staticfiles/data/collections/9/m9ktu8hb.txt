A 55-year-old man who lived in rural Indiana with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 presented to the Emergency Department in May with 5 days of headache, fever to 104 Â°F, diffuse myalgias, and generalized weakness. He frequently performed yardwork. He had noticed a tick on his arm 10 days before that he removed with tweezers. He reported that it was not engorged. Three weeks prior to presentation, he went camping in the forest and slept in a cabin. He had frequent contact with his 3-year-old granddaughter who had a recent febrile upper respiratory illness.

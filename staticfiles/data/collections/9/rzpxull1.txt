The relatively short circulatory half-life (2-3 min) of staphylokinase is a major drawback in the development of SAK- (staphylokinase) based thrombolytic drug. A rapid and sensitive method, based on indirect competitive ELISA, was developed and validated for quantitative determination of SAK in rabbit plasma. The dynamic range of the assay varied between 0.41 ± 0.16 μg/L and 9.03 ± 0.38 μg/L (R(2) = 0.98) for SAK in rabbit plasma. There were no dilution linearity issues apparent with this assay. The precision (% CV) ranged from 4.6-9.7% for the intraassay and from 17.1-19.3% for interassay. This validated method was successfully employed for evaluation of various pharmacokinetic parameters of SAK in rabbit.

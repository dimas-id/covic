Adult C3H mice are resistant to intraperitoneal infection with murine coronavirus JHM, whereas suckling offspring of non-immune females are susceptible. Resistance can be conferred on suckling C3H mice by postnatal transmission of maternal immunity, if transfer preceeds infection. Suckling mice succumb to infection even when they receive maternal antibodies within 1 day after infection. Prenatal transmission alone without subsequent postnatal transmission of maternal immunity is not sufficient to provide resistance. Persistence of virus without clinical consequences was observed when the supply of breast milk anti-JHMV antibodies was terminated 5 days before infection. Immune reactions restricted by histocompatibility antigens do not play a crucial role in bestowing resistance. As neutralizing anti-JHM serum antibody titers of adult mice only rise sharply 5 to 7 days after infection, these results indicate that infection of adults can be arrested by immunological means but that, in addition, the rate of virus dissemination must be limited by other non-immunological mechanisms.

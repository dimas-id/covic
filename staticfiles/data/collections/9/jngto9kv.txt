Viruses play a significant role in serious infections in adults and sometimes lead to the need for hospitalization and admission to intensive care units, especially in cases of severe respiratory distress or encephalopathy. Influenza and parainfluenza viruses, syncytial respiratory virus, herpes viruses and adenovirures are the most frequent causes of these severe infections. A review of the literature has been performed in order to update the epidemiology, pathogenesis and therapeutic approach of viral infections affecting immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in intensive care units and has a high morbidity and mortality rate. It is mainly a bacterial disease, although the potential role of viruses as pathogens or copathogens in VAP is under discussion. Therefore, a brief review of the potential pathogenic role of viruses in VAP has also been performed.

Background and Objectives: The new beta-coronavirus, which caused Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), a major respiratory outbreak in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is now prevalent in many countries around the world Identifying PCR-based viruses is a well-known and relatively stable protocol Unfortunately, the high mutation rates may lead to widespread changes in viral nucleic acid sequences, and so using specific primers for PCR can be recom-mended In this study, we evaluated the power of a conventional RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the five set primer sets Materials and Methods: The five genomic regions of the Coronavirus SARS-2 virus including Nucleocapsids (N), Enve-lope (E), RNA depended RNA Polymerase (RdRp), ORF1ab and Spike (S) were selected for primer designing A conventional RT-PCR was performed to compare sensitivity, specificity and other analytical characteristics of primers designed against two Real Time PCR commercial kits Results: The result of the comparative analysis showed that the ORF1ab, N and RdRp primers had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value higher than other primers A significant difference in the analytical sensitivity between the studied primer sets in RT-PCR kits was observed Conclusion: In this study, the ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid and RdRp regions have the best primers for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between different genes that have been suggested

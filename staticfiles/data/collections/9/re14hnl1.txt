The severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 is now a global catastrophic event. Currently there is no approved drug or vaccine for the disease. Methylene blue (MB, oxidized form, blue color) has been used in many different areas of clinical medicine, ranging from malaria to orthopedics. Leucomethylene Blue (reduced form of MB, colorless) may be applied for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the scientific evidences. In severe patients, there is a cytokine storm (hyperinflammation) and high oxidative stress (OS). Inflammation and OS has a mutual correlation and exacerbate each other. In human body, MB first induces OS through absorbing electron (like a free radical) from other molecules, if the body could counteract to this OS, then reduced MB decreases OS through other mechanisms. Reduced MB could prevent inflammation, propagation of the virus RNA, and also improves hypoxia through reducing methemoglobin. Therefore, to avoid the increment of OS, we suggest using Leucomethylene Blue through the following protocol: The IV cocktail contains 50 mg MB (1mg/kg, 50-kg weight), 1000-2000 mg vitamin C, 500-1000 mg N-Acetylcysteine (or glutathione or cysteine or Î±-lipoic acid) and 10-20 gr urea (optional) in 100 ml dextrose 5%. Before the injection, the cocktail should be kept in a dark place for 1-2 hour to become fade or colorless.

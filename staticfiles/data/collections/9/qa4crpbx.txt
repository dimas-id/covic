The splenic vascular tumor referred to as a hemangioma is rare and typically presents as a small asymptomatic lesion. We report a case of a giant splenic cyst in a 13-year-old boy with abdominal distension. He underwent laparoscopic excision of the splenic cyst without complication. Pathology revealed a vascular tumor. At 15 months of follow-up, he continued to be asymptomatic, and abdominal ultrasound showed no recurrence of his disease. Laparoscopic excision of giant splenic cysts is a viable option in children, allowing for preservation of normal splenic tissue.

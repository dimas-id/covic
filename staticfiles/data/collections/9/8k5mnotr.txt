The coronavirus pandemic first started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and affected the whole world. In our country, new measures to be taken were announced after the first case was seen on March 11, 2020. In this study, patients who admitted to the smoking cessation clinic in 2018 and followed up by phone, regarding smoking cessation status in 2019 were questioned for their smoking cessation status after the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In this descriptive study, the patients who applied to the smoking cessation outpatient clinic in 2018 were questioned regarding their smoking cessation status after 1 year and after the pandemic. It was investigated whether coronapandemia had an effect on smoking cessation. The data were evaluated by using SPSS 22 software. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 357 individuals with a median of FagerstrÃ¶m score of 7.0 were included in the study. Seventy-one (19.9%) of the subjects used nicotine tape, 268 (75.1%) used varenicline, and 18 (5.0%) used both. When the success of those who quit smoking before pandemic and those who quit smoking after pandemic were compared, a statistically significant relationship was found (p < 0.001). In our study, the rate of smoking cessation after 1 year was 23.7%, and the most common side effects were psychiatric complaints, whereas the rate of smoking cessation during the pandemic period was 31.1%. In order to increase the rate of smoking cessation, which is an important public health problem, more counseling should be provided, during the pandemic period.

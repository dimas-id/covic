We compared the clinical characteristics and antibiotic therapy of community-acquired pneumonia patients who were positive on a respiratory virus molecular test (polymerase chain reaction) with those who were negative. We found that respiratory virus molecular polymerase chain reaction testing has a minimal impact on reducing antibiotic utilization among viral pneumonia patients.

A 42-year-old man sustained a stroke secondary to malignant hypertension and was found to have complete aortic interruption. We report a case of real-time image-guided endovascular repair to highlight the value of preprocedural planning and intraprocedural cone beam computed tomography. Two-dimensional fluoroscopy enhanced with three-dimensional landmarks from cone beam computed tomography was used to direct a Nykanen radiofrequency wire (Baylis Medical, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) through the interruption, avoiding critical adjacent structures. A covered Cheatham-Platinum stent (NuMED, Inc, Hopkinton, NY) was deployed successfully, recanalizing the thoracic aorta. The pressure gradient normalized, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 1. At 10-month follow-up, the patient was on an antihypertensive regimen of two minimum-dose drugs.

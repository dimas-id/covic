Background Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was noted that males seemed to be more affected than females. We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in six countries. Methods Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the published reports from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, and the United States . Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the six countries, for seven age-groups. Findings The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The differences were greater in the younger age groups. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 2.53, 2.92, 2.57, 1.83, 1.57, 1.58 and 1.48 for ages 0-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89 and 90+. There was remarkable consistency between countries in the magnitude of the M:F CFRs, in each age group. In meta-regression, age group explained almost all the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. Conclusions The sex differences in the CFRs are intriguing and are compatible with the male dominance in the incidence rates of many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the greater severity of the disease in males, particularly at younger ages, may be part of the disease mechanism and should be explored further.

Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is a condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bronchiolar walls resulting in narrowing or obliteration of the bronchiolar lumen. The most common causes are childhood lower respiratory tract infection, hematopoietic stem cell or lung and heart-lung transplantation, and toxic fume inhalation. The most frequent clinical manifestations are progressive dyspnea and dry cough. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate airflow obstruction and air trapping. Radiographic manifestations include reduction of the peripheral vascular markings, increased lung lucency, and overinflation. The chest radiograph, however, is often normal. High-resolution CT is currently the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of patients with suspected or proven OB. The characteristic findings on high-resolution CT consist of areas of decreased attenuation and vascularity (mosaic perfusion pattern) on inspiratory scans and air trapping on expiratory scans. Other CT findings of OB include bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, bronchial wall thickening, small centrilobular nodules, and three-in-bud opacities. Recent studies suggest that hyperpolarized (3)He-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging may allow earlier recognition of obstructive airway disease and therefore may be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with OB.

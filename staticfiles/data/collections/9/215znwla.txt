AIMS To test the efficacy of the mini-gastric bypass (MGB) in the treatment of morbid obesity related to the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). PATIENTS AND METHODS Three young male patients (mean age 15.6 years) complaining with PWS were treated by MGB with the aim to improve morbid obesity associated with the syndrome. Preoperative body mass index was 51 ± 4.13 kg/m(2). Two patients suffered from both hypertension and frequent sleep apnea crises. The mean preoperative level of fasting plasma acyl ghrelin was 1417.26 ± 289.37 pg/ml. All patients underwent a laparoscopic MGB. RESULTS The postoperative period was uneventful and all patients were discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The patients suffering from both hypertension and respiratory crises are now free from receiving any therapeutic support. When measured, the postoperative level of fasting plasma acyl ghrelin decreased to 675.5, 524.6, and 353.1 pg/ml, respectively. An excess weight loss of 79% has been recorded at two years so far. To date, no nutritional impairment, weight regain, or need for revision surgery has been recorded. CONCLUSION MGB appears to provide an effective weight reduction in patients suffering from PWS without determining significant nutritional impairment or weight regain. Larger studies are however required.

Carotid atherosclerotic disease is implicated in 15% to 30% of all ischemic strokes. Carotid endarterectomy has been the standard treatment for carotid artery atherosclerosis, but carotid angioplasty and stenting have emerged as a less-invasive treatment alternative. In this article, we review the recent literature on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, investigations, and treatment for atherosclerotic carotid artery disease, focusing on the role of carotid endarterectomy and carotid angioplasty and stenting in the treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid lesions.

Uncontrolled fine generation during the milling process is a challenge for dry granulation by roller compaction. Here, we report the observation that ribbon thickness can significantly influence percentage of fines. Thus, among other parameters, ribbon thickness needs to be controlled for the development of a robust roller compaction process and ensure successful scale up.

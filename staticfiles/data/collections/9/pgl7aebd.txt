Abstract Background While respiratory viral infections are recognized as a frequent cause of illness in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, HCoV−OC43 infections have rarely been investigated as healthcare-associated infections in this population. Objectives In this report, HCoV−OC43 isolates collected from HSCT patients were retrospectively characterized to identify potential clusters of infection that may stand for a hospital transmission. Study design Whole-genome and S gene sequences were obtained from nasal swabs using next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic trees were constructed. Similar identity matrix and determination of the most common ancestor were used to compare clusters of patient’s sequences. Amino acids substitutions were analysed. Results Genotypes B, E, F and G were identified. Two clusters of patients were defined from chronological data and phylogenetic trees. Analyses of amino acids substitutions of the S protein sequences identified substitutions specific for genotype F strains circulating among European people. Conclusions HCoV−OC43 may be implicated in healthcare-associated infections.

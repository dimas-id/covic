Abstract Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for detecting the structural glycoprotein gene of yellow head virus (YHV). The RT-LAMP assay is a novel method of gene amplification that amplifies nucleic acid with high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions with a set of four specially designed primers that recognize six distinct sequences of the target. The whole procedure is very simple and rapid, and reaction time and temperatures were optimized for 60min at 65Â°C, respectively. Detection of gene amplification could be accomplished by agarose gel electrophoresis. The standardized RT-LAMP procedure was used to detect YHV in the heart and gill from infected shrimp. Thus, the RT-LAMP assay is extremely rapid, cost-effective, sensitive and specific and has potential usefulness for rapid diagnosis for YHV detection in shrimp.

For antiviral signaling mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), the recruitment of cytosolic RLRs and downstream molecules (such as TBK1 and IKKε) to mitochondrial platform is a central event that facilitates the establishment of host antiviral state. Here, we present an example of viral targeting for immune evasion through spatial isolation of TBK1/IKKε from mitochondrial antiviral platform, which was employed by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a deadly bunyavirus emerging recently. We showed that SFTSV nonstructural protein NSs functions as the interferon (IFN) antagonist, mainly via suppressing TBK1/IKKε–IRF3 signaling. NSs mediates the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), and the blockage of IB formation impairs IFN-inhibiting activity of NSs. We next demonstrate that IBs are utilized to compartmentalize TBK1/IKKε. The compartmentalization results in spatial isolation of the kinases from mitochondria, and deprived TBK1/IKKε may participate in antiviral complex assembly, leading to the blockage of IFN induction. This study proposes a new role of viral IBs as virus-built ‘jail’ for imprisoning cellular factors and presents a novel and likely common mechanism of viral immune evasion through spatial isolation of critical signaling molecules from the mitochondrial antiviral platform.

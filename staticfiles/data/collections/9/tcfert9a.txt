SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new virus causing respiratory illness outbreak. Nowadays, COVID-19 has spread to several countries around the world and is presently a major global concern. It appears that no certain effective pharmaceutical agent is currently available for it. It seems that obesity is one of the biggest risk factors related to COVID-19 hospitalization and critical illness. The strengthening of the body systems by non-drug ways is very important especially in obese people. On the basis of some indirect evidence, it seems that moderate physical activity can be recommended as a non-pharmacological, inexpensive, and viable way to cope with corona. On the other hand, recommending higher intensity exercise needs further consideration to make final decision in this regard.

The long-term monitoring of cardiovascular signs requires a wearable and connected electrocardiogram (ECG) healthcare device. It increases user’s comfort and diagnosis quality of chronic cardiac and/or high-risk patients. This paper covers the enormous data to be transmitted from the ECG device to the physician’s, namely the cardiologist’s, control unit. Existent ECG devices uniformly sample analog signals and convert them to digital samples which are compressed before data transmission. However, event-driven sampling simultaneously compresses and samples. Therefore, this paper quantitatively compares successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) compression and level-crossing analog-to-digital converter (LC-ADC). Evaluation metrics are the percent root-mean-square difference ([Formula: see text] ), bit compression ratio ([Formula: see text] ) and data length in bits. When a 12-bit reconstruction is operated on the outputs of an 8-bit LC-ADC with 12-bit and 10-kHz reference counter, the [Formula: see text] is equal to 80% for 75% of test ECG signals. That is better than the 71.87% [Formula: see text] of the 12-bit 1-kHz SAR ADC with DWT compression. The modeled LC-ADC guarantees a signal quality in terms of [Formula: see text] comparable to the [Formula: see text] of the SAR ADC with DWT compression. The data length in bits of the LC-ADC is lower than the data length in bits of the SAR ADC with more than 14-bit resolution with DWT compression for 82% of the test ECG signals. However, for lower resolutions, to obtain lower power consumption for radiofrequency transmission, a better alternative remains the SAR ADC with DWT compression.

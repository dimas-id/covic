We reviewed the background information and previous clinical studies that considered the use of allogeneic amniotic tissue and fluid (granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid) in the treatment of chronic diabetic foot wounds. This innovation represents a relatively new approach to wound management by delivering a unique allograft of live human cells in a nonimmunogenic structural tissue matrix. Developed to fill soft tissue defects and bone voids and to convey antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory capabilities, granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid does not require fetal death, because its procurement is performed with maternal consent during birth. In the present investigation, 20 chronic wounds (20 patients) that had been treated with standard wound therapy for a mean of 36.6 ± 31.58 weeks and with a mean baseline area of 10.15 ± 19.54 cm(2) were followed up during a 12-week observation period or until they healed. A total of 18 of the wounds (90%) healed during the 12-week observation period, and none of the wounds progressed to amputation. From our experience with the patients in the present case series, we believe that granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid represents a useful option for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot wounds.

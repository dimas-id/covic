Calicivirus infection of dogs was epidemiologically investigated by using canine calicivirus (CaCV) strain 48 as a reference. Similar RNA polymerase gene sequences and neutralizing antibodies against CaCV were detected in 1.7% of clinical specimens and 57% of serum samples, respectively, suggesting a high prevalence of CaCV in dog populations.

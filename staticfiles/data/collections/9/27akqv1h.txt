BACKGROUND Long-term complications of previous rectal surgery (e.g., enterovisceral fistula, anastomotic stricture, rectal stenosis) can be challenging problems for which transabdominal or transperineal surgery with or without definitive fecal diversion is often required. Transanal endoscopic surgery (TES) might allow for local treatment of these complications, thereby saving patients from otherwise major surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients undergoing TES in the IJsselland Hospital (NL) since 1996 were recorded in a prospective database, of which twenty patients were treated for complications after previous rectal surgery. Data on prior treatment, surgical techniques, outcomes, and need for additional surgery were collected. RESULTS Twenty patients were identified from the database (rectourinary fistula n = 3, rectovaginal fistula n = 5, anastomotic stricture n = 8, and rectal stenosis n = 4). One of the three (33 %) rectourinary fistulas and two of five (40 %) rectovaginal fistulas were successfully treated with TES. Anastomotic strictures were successfully treated in 5/8 (63 %) patients. Strictures after local excision of rectal tumors were successfully treated in 3/4 (75 %) patients. No minor complication and one major complication occurred (rectovaginal fistula after stenoplasty eventually requiring Hartmann's procedure). CONCLUSIONS Transanal treatment of anastomotic strictures, rectal stenosis, and fistula after prior rectal surgery is safe and effective in a large proportion of patients. TES should be considered as a first step in all patients presenting with these late complications after rectal surgery.

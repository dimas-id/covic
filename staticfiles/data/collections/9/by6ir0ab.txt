This Special Issue of Chemistry-A European Journal is dedicated to the Chemical Functionalization of 2D Materials, and features some great contributions from experts in the field of 2D materials. This issue was originally assembled to support the Symposiumâ G "Chemical Functionalization of 2D Materials" at the European Materials Research Society (E-MRS) 2020 Spring Meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held in Strasbourg, France, from May 25th to 29th, 2020. Although the E-MRS 2020 Spring Meeting has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the publication of this Special Issue has proceeded and has become even more important as the contributors discuss diverse and timely research themes related to 2D materials. In this Editorial, a brief overview of the different types of 2D materials is given, together with the chemical functionalization schemes that can be applied to them to achieve new properties as well as enable improved performance in applications. Some of the articles featured in this Special Issue are also highlighted, with the hope that they will inspire readers and further advance the field.

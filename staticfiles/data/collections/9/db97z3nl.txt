Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that human-to-human transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) most frequently occurs through virus-laden respiratory droplets discharged from infected individuals while coughing and sneezing. Aerosols can act as another potential transmission route. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has advised medical personnel to consider taking 'airborne precautions'. It is important to protect dentists and patients and reduce the amount of spatter produced during dental procedures. In order to prevent airborne transmission, dental offices should be sufficiently ventilated, with great emphasis placed upon removing bioaerosols.

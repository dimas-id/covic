The duodenum has become recognized as a metabolic signaling center that is involved in regulating insulin action and, therefore, insulin resistance states such as type 2 diabetes. Bariatric surgery and other manipulations of the upper intestine, in particular the duodenum, have shown that limiting nutrient exposure or contact in this key region exerts powerful metabolic effects. Early human clinical trial data suggest that endoscopic hydrothermal duodenal mucosal resurfacing is well tolerated in human subjects and has an acceptable safety profile. This article describes the rationale for this endoscopic approach and its early human use, including safety, tolerability, and early efficacy.

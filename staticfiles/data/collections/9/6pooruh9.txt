PURPOSE The aim of our study was to compare single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC) with respect to clinical outcomes. METHODS Patients with less than a 28 body mass index (BMI) and a benign gall bladder disease were enrolled in this study. From January 2011 to February 2012, 30 consecutive patients who underwent SILC were compared with 30 patients who underwent CLC during the same period. In this study, all operations were performed by one surgeon. In each group, patient characteristics and perioperative data were collected. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the preoperative characteristics. There was no significant difference in the postoperative laboratory result (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase), number of conversion and complication cases, and length of hospital stay. The operation time was significantly longer in the SILC group (78.5 ± 17.8 minutes in SILC group vs. 34.9 ± 5.75 minutes in CLC group, P < 0.0001). The total nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug usage during perioperative period showed significantly higher in SILC groups (162 ± 51 mg in the SILC group vs. 138 ± 30 mg in the CLC group), but there was no statistically significant difference in opioid usage between two groups. The postoperative pain score was significantly higher in the SILC group at second, third, and tenth postoperative day. Satisfaction of postoperative wound showed superiority in SILC group. CONCLUSION SILC seems to be an acceptable alternative to CLC with acceptable results. However, it is not enough to propose any real benefits of SILC when compared with CLC in terms of operation time and postoperative pain.

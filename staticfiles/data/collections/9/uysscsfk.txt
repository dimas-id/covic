Simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification, and fermentation (SLSF) has attracted much attention for the production of bio-based chemicals, including L-lactic acid, due to its high efficiency and low cost. In this study, a lactic acid-producing bacterium with high tolerance of temperature up to 55 °C was isolated and characterized as Enterococcus faecalis DUT1805. Various strategies of stepwise controlled temperature were proposed and investigated for glucose utilization. The results indicated that E. faecalis DUT 1805 exhibited an optimal temperature at 50 °C, which could achieve temperature compatibility of enzyme, saccharification, and fermentation, and decrease the possibility of contamination by the other microorganisms during the large-scale fermentation. To reduce the cost of raw material and operation for lactic acid production, aging paddy rice with hull (APRH) was used in L-lactic acid production by simultaneous liquefaction, saccharification, and fermentation (SLSF). An open SLSF operation at 50 °C and pH 6.5, and 17% (w/v) solid loading in 5 L bioreactors was demonstrated with the lactic acid titer, yield, and productivity of 73.75 g/L, 87% to initial starch, and 2.17 g/(L h), respectively.

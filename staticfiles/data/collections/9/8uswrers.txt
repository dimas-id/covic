Radio frequency identification (RFID) provides a means to implement the “last-mile” connection in a connected world, often referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). RFID has been widely used in the retail and construction sectors for supply-chain management, and has provided significant benefits to those sectors. RFID has also been employed by healthcare to improve supply-chain management and monitor the locations of patients and providers to improve service offerings. The wireless and low-cost aspects of RFID introduce privacy concerns. However, there are some privacy issues related to the use of RFID, including tracking and the ability of an attacker to obtain sensitive data that is stored in the RFID tag. This chapter will explore the use of RFID in healthcare and identify issues relating to privacy that need to be addressed in these use-cases. An overview of RFID technology is presented followed by an overview of applications of RFID in healthcare. The privacy issues are then identified and potential solutions described. The privacy issues identified can be addressed using proven and standard security practices, many of which are already implemented by healthcare providers. A discussion of how to extend these practices to include RFID technology is provided.

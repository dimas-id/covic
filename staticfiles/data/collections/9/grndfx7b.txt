Two direct blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies to Breda virus in sera of cattle were compared. An ELISA with consecutive addition of antigen and test serum to an antibody-coated plate gave higher positive: negative absorbence ratios than an ELISA in which antigen and test serum were added simultaneously. Sera collected from breeding and fattening herds in The Netherlands (n = 1313) and the F.R.G. (n = 716) were tested, and antibodies to Breda virus were demonstrated in 94% of adult cattle. Ninety percent of newborn calves had high levels of maternal antibodies, which waned until the age of 3 months. Active seroconversion occurred between 7 and 24 months in most animals.

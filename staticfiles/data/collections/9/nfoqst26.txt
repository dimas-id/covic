Influenza rates for the US Army and West Point cadets showed that seasonal influenza was not necessarily an annual event, and there was little influenzal illness in the decade before 1918 except for 1911 and 1916. Annual records from 1862â€“1918 also indicated a similar paucity of influenzal illness before 1890.

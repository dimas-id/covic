The MUON Detector (MD) of LHCb is one of the largest instruments of this kind worldwide, and one of the most irradiated. It has performed exceptionally well during the RUN1 and RUN2 of the LHC at an instantaneous luminosity of 4$\times$10$^{32}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, with tracking inefficiencies at the level of 1$\%$ and 2.6$\%$, respectively. Looking forward for the future LHCb Upgrade 2 (U2) planned in 2031 and aiming in running the detector at increased luminosity by a factor $\sim$50, and at the same time keeping a very high ($\sim$99$\%$) detection efficiency, an option with reuse significant part of the present Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) in a new Muon System is presented. In addition, the first idea of new Front End Electronics (FEE) and an existing test setup applicable for designing both: new MWPCs with a higher granularity of the cathode readout pads and new FEE are described.

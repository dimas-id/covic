Respiratory conditions are very common among children. This chapter aims to provide a quick review of common respiratory conditions with which the general pediatrician preparing for the certifying board exam should be familiar. The chapter begins with a review of common diagnostic testing methods used in the evaluation of respiratory diseases. Subsequently, the reader will find a description as well as recommended evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management of general signs and symptoms frequently encountered in respiratory medicine. Summaries of specific conditions follow, which provide brief high-yield facts on background, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management. Specific conditions are grouped similarly to the content outline for the ABP into conditions of the upper airway, lower airway, pulmonary parenchyma, chest wall disease, and disorders in breathing. More extensive summaries regarding asthma and cystic fibrosis are also included.

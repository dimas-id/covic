BACKGROUND Gross deformity of the foot in Charcot neuroarthropathy can lead to collapse and subsequent ulceration, infection, amputation, or premature death. This study evaluated healing of midfoot ulcerations of Charcot neuroarthropathy using PriMatrix, a novel acellular fetal bovine dermal matrix. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, 20 patients with ulcerations of the midfoot associated with Charcot neuroarthropathy were treated with either PriMatrix in addition to standard wound care (PriMatrix group,n = 12) or standard wound care alone (control group, n = 8). All patients had chronic, nonhealing foot ulcerations of at least 2250 mm(3) for a minimum of 30 days duration. All foot ulcerations were full thickness with subcutaneous involvement. Ankle brachial index ≥0.90 and/or transcutaneous oximetry (TcPo(2)) ≥40 mm Hg at the periulcer site was necessary for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had acute or chronic osteomyelitis of the foot. RESULTS Demography, risk factors, baseline severity of Charcot neuroarthropathy, and wound volume (control 4078 mm(3), PriMatrix 3737.5 mm(3), P = nonsignificant) were similar between treatment groups. Mean time to healing in the PriMatrix group (116 days, 95% CI = 109-123) was significantly shorter than in the control group (180 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 171-188); P < .0001. A significantly faster rate of healing was observed with PriMatrix (87.9 mm(3)/wk, 95% CI = 115.2% to 60.6%) compared with control (59.0 mm(3)/wk, 95% CI = 72.8% to 45.3%); P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS The significantly faster rate of healing and steeper slope of volume reduction in the PriMatrix group warrants further investigation into its effects on healing of neuropathic ulcerations and potential limb salvage.

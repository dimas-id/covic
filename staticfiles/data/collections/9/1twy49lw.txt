A female Bernese Mountain Dog was diagnosed with a right middle lung lobe mass. The dog was positioned in a left lateral recumbency and one-lung ventilation was used under general anesthesia. Video-assisted thoracic surgery anatomical lobectomy was performed with 4 cm small thoracotomy and two 6-mm ports. Pulmonary vessels and bronchus were dissected and isolated individually at the hilum of the right middle lung lobe. Pulmonary vessels were ligated and were coagulated and transected using a vessel sealing device. The bronchus was ligated and transected. The mass in the right middle lung lobe was removed with a clean margin and without complications. Video-assisted thoracic surgery anatomical lobectomy was used to successfully remove a primary lung tumor in a dog.

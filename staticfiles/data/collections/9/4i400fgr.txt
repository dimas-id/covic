The natural history of untreated acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is poor, with high rates of mortality (5-33%) and severe long-term disability (40-80% of survivors), despite therapy with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. We analyzed outcomes in 31 consecutive patients with major ischemic stroke due to acute proximal MCA occlusion who were treated at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center from February 2010 to October 2012 by endovascular means, using the Solitaire stent (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA) as a thrombectomy device. Patients had a mean age of 63.3±16.2 years (range, 26-92). The admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 19.5±4.3 (median 20). Mean time from symptom onset to femoral artery puncture was 3.8±1.1 hours (median 4 hours). Mean time to recanalization was 46.9±11.1 minutes. Successful recanalization by means of stent-based thrombectomy alone was achieved in 90% of cases and reached 100% after combining definitive stent implantation in three patients. There was no arterial rupture or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic transformation developed in seven patients (23%), but was symptomatic in only one. Post-procedure CT scan or MRI demonstrated >90% sparing of cortex at risk in all patients. Functional outcome at 90 day follow-up was modified Rankin Score 0-2 in 77% of all patients and 88% of patients younger than 80 years. Three patients (10%) died during hospitalization due to mesenteric event, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Our experience suggests that stent-based thrombectomy in selected patients for acute MCA occlusions is safe, very effective in terms of arterial recanalization, and associated with improved neurological outcome. If validated by other groups, endovascular treatment may be proposed as the therapy of choice for MCA occlusion.

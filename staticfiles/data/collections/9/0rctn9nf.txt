BACKGROUND In an effort to contain the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems globally implemented telemedical solutions in order to overcome staffing, technical and infrastructural limitations. In Germany, a multitude of telemedical systems are already in function, while new approaches are rapidly developed in response to the crisis. However, the extent of current implementation within different healthcare settings, the user acceptance and perception as well as the hindering technical and regulatory obstacles remain unclear. OBJECTIVE To assess the current status quo of availability as well as routine use of telemedical solutions, the user acceptance and the subjectively perceived burdens on telemedical approaches. Furthermore to assess the perception of the quality of public information amongst professional groups and their preferred communication channels. METHODS A national online survey conducted on 14 consecutive days in March-April 2020, distributed to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals in German language. RESULTS A total of 2827 medical professionals participated in the study. 65.6% (n=1855) identified as doctors, 29.5% (n=833) as nursing staff and 4.9% (n=139) as others, e.g. therapeutic staff. A majority of participants rated the significance of telemedicine within the crisis as high (39%, n=1065) or neutral (26.4%, n=720), however there were significant differences between doctors and nurses (p=.01) as well as between the stationary sector compared to the ambulatory sector (p <.001). Telemedicine already is in routine use in 19.6% and in partial use in 40.2% of German healthcare providers. Participants working in private practices (40.2%, n=239) or private clinics (39.0%, n=23) experience less regulatory or technical obstacles, compared to university hospitals (49.2%, n=586). A majority of doctors rated the public information quality on COVID as good (50.8%, n= 942) or very good (11.5%, n=213), nurses rated the quality of public information significantly lower (p <.01). Participant's age negatively correlated with the perception of significance of the telemedicine (Spearmans's rho = -0.23; p <.001). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine has a broad acceptance within German medical professionals. However, in order to establish telemedical structures within routine care, technical and regulatory burdens have to be overcome. CLINICALTRIAL

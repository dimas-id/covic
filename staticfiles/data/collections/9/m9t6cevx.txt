Cell fusion is an approach for combining genetic and epigenetic information between two different types of cells. Electrofusion for generating hybrid cells between mouse embryonic stem cells and somatic cells, which is a type of nonchemically induced and nonvirus-mediated cell fusion, is introduced here as a highly effective, reproducible, and biomedically safe in vitro system. Under optimized electrofusion conditions, cells are aligned and form pearl chains between electrodes in response to AC pulse stimulation, and subsequently adjacent cytoplasmic membranes are fused by DC pulse stimulation. Hybrid cells survive as drug-resistant colonies in selection medium. Cell fusion is a technique that is applied widely in the life sciences. A recent topic of great interest in the field of stem cell research is the successful production of cloned animals via epigenetic reprogramming of somatic nuclei. Interestingly, nuclear reprogramming for conferring pluripotency on somatic nuclei also occurs via cell fusion between pluripotential stem cells and somatic cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that spontaneous cell fusion contributes to generating the intrinsic plasticity of tissue stem cells. Cell fusion technology may make important contributions to the fields of regenerative medicine and epigenetic reprogramming.

BACKGROUND Fever is among the most frequently reported problems in returning travellers. OBJECTIVE This article provides an overview of the general approach to fever in the returned traveller, including identification of common causes and management. DISCUSSION The returned traveller may present with fever and it is important to exclude life threatening conditions such as malaria that may be related to the travel. A complete risk assessment should be undertaken, including a complete travel history, examination and further investigations, to help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Common tropical diseases found include malaria, dengue, enteric fever, rickettsial infections and respiratory infections. General practitioners should be alert to the public health implications of travel related diseases.

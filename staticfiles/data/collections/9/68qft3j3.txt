A porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was identified in the Chinese mainland and found to be closely related to Hong Kong strain HKU15-155 but differed from PDCoV strains in the United States and South Korea. The complete genome of PDCoV strain CH/SXD1/201 was sequenced and analyzed to further characterize PDCoV in Chinese swine.

There is a lack of information about evaluation of pediatric minimal access surgery complications; the Clavien-Dindo classification was never used for a large series of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic pediatric procedures. With a prospective Morbidity and Mortality database, all the minimal access surgical procedures carried out between 2012 and 2016 were included in this study. Statistical analyses were used to valuate modification of surgical techniques in to 2 periods (period 1: January 2012 to February 2014; period 2: February 2014 to February 2016). A total of 1374 minimal access procedures were performed on 1371 patients. The overall complication rate was 2.9%. No differences, in terms of complications, were observed between elective and emergency procedures (P=0.3). There was a significant difference between the complication rate of thoracoscopic surgery (P=0.027). These results provide the relevance of adequate recording system and standardized classification for analyses and reduction of complications for pediatric minimal access procedures.

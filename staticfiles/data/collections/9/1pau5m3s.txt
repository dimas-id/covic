Abstract Many public databases and analytical resources are available to facilitate virology research. The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR, see “Relevant Websites section”) and Influenza Research Database (IRD, see “Relevant Websites section”) are comprehensive and highly curated repositories of genome and protein sequence records and annotations, protein structures, immune epitopes, and epidemiological and surveillance data about human and related viral pathogens. These data are acquired from public repositories, direct submissions and in-house bioinformatics analyses. The resources offer seamless integration of data, analytics and visualization, and are freely available without cost or restriction to facilitate diagnostics and therapeutics development for priority pathogens.

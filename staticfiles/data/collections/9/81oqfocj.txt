Objective: To compare the technical elements of health standards for nosocomial infection control, health protection, health information, and health emergency and biosafety in the context of the prevention and control of COVID-19, and provide support for the further optimization of the epidemic prevention and control guidelines. Methods: Above mentioned health standards used in COVID-19 prevention and control were collected for a systematic comparison with "Guidelines for Prevention and Control of COVID-19 in Medical Institutions" (the 1st Edition) from the perspective of technical elements. Results: The application scope and technical elements of the current health standards basically meet the needs for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic. Conclusions: The implementation of the current health standards can provide strong technical support for the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic. The experience obtained in the epidemic prevention and control can also contribute to the further revision and improvement of the health standards.

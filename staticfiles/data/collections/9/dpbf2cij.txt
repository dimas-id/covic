OBJECTIVE Intracorporeal reconstruction of the digestive tract is technically challenging. The V-Loc 180 wound closure device (Covidien) is a self-anchoring unidirectional barbed suture that obviates the need for knot tying. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the use of the novel suture in gastrointestinal enterotomy closure. METHODS The subjects comprised patients with malignant disease who were scheduled to undergo laparoscopic gastrectomy with curative intent. The barbed suture was used to close the entry hole for the linear stapler during intracorporeal reconstruction following laparoscopic gastric resection. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who developed anastomotic leakage at the site where the barbed suture was applied. RESULTS Between July 2012 and March 2015, 242 patients were enrolled. Of 362 anastomoses, the enterotomy hole at 256 sites was closed using the barbed suture. These 256 sites consisted of 95 gastroduodenostomies, 25 gastrogastrostomies, 13 gastrojejunostomies, 90 jejunojejunostomies, 17 esophagojejunostomies and 16 primary closures of the stomach following local gastric resection. There were no anastomosis-related complications, conversion to usual sutures, mechanical closure of the entry hole and reoperation due to adhesive obstructions or mortality over a median follow-up period of 17.8 months. CONCLUSIONS The use of the unidirectional barbed absorbable suture for gastrointestinal closure is safe and effective in laparoscopic gastrectomy.

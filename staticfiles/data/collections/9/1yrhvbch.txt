BACKGROUND In multiple myeloma (MM), relapse is a frequent complication after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT). To reduce the risk of relapse, additional therapy has been added post-ASCT. In a nontransplant relapse setting, the combination of intravenous bortezomib and oral vorinostat (BV) was studied and showed efficacy. Therefore, it was reasonable to study this combination therapy post-ASCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS We report on BV given post-ASCT. All 30 patients underwent conditioning for ASCT with high-dose melphalan. After recovery from the acute transplant-related toxicity, BV therapy was started and given for a total of 12 (28-day) cycles. RESULTS The most common toxicities were hematological, gastrointestinal (diarrhea and nausea), fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. The median follow-up for BV patients is 7.8 (range: 6.12-9.03) years. After BV therapy, 18 patients (60%) are alive, and 9 (30%) are alive without disease progression. CONCLUSIONS BV can be given post-ASCT with an acceptable toxicity profile and produces reasonable disease-free and overall survival rates. A randomized study comparing the BV regimen to single-agent lenalidomide or bortezomib is needed.

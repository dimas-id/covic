The characterization of functional yet nonprotein coding (nc) RNAs has expanded the role of RNA in the cell from a passive player in the central dogma of molecular biology to an active regulator of gene expression. The misregulation of ncRNA function has been linked with a variety of diseases and disorders ranging from cancers to neurodegeneration. However, a detailed molecular understanding of how ncRNAs function has been limited; due, in part, to the difficulties associated with obtaining high‐resolution structures of large RNAs. Tertiary structure determination of RNA as a whole is hampered by various technical challenges, all of which are exacerbated as the size of the RNA increases. Namely, RNAs tend to be highly flexible and dynamic molecules, which are difficult to crystallize. Biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offers a viable alternative to determining the structure of large RNA molecules that do not readily crystallize, but is itself hindered by some technical limitations. Recently, a series of advancements have allowed the biomolecular NMR field to overcome, at least in part, some of these limitations. These advances include improvements in sample preparation strategies as well as methodological improvements. Together, these innovations pave the way for the study of ever larger RNA molecules that have important biological function. RNA Structure and Dynamics > RNA Structure, Dynamics, and Chemistry.

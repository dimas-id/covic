Graft‐versus‐host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is known to be mediated by cytotoxic T‐cell effectors and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, the lung injury observed in severe COVID‐19 cases appears to be related to a massive production of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. The selective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has shown promising results in the context of GVHD, and different trials are currently underway in patients with severe COVID‐19; nevertheless, no clinical observation of safety or efficacy of treatment with ruxolitinib in this context has been published yet. We describe a first case of severe COVID‐19 developed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with a concomitant chronic GVHD (cGVHD), in which a treatment with ruxolitinib was administered with good tolerance and positive outcome.

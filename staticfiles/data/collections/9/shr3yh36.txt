Background Current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is confronting Mexico with pre-existing challenges: epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and high social inequity. Those challenges may worsen burden of COVID-19. Methods and findings Using data from national reporting of SARS-CoV-2 tested individuals, we analyzed those with a positive result to estimated odds of hospitalization, intubation and death based on pre-existing non-communicable diseases and socioeconomic indicators. We found that obesity, diabetes and hypertension increase the odds of the 3 outcomes, as well as indicators of social vulnerability. Conclusions Mexico's response to COVID-19 is stymied by a synergistic double challenge: raging NCDs and extreme social inequity. The response to the current pandemic must take both of them into account both to be effective and to ensure that the burden of COVID-19 not fall disproportionately on those who are already disadvantaged.

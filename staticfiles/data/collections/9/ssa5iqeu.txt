PURPOSE Pharmacy dispensing databases are often used to identify patients' medications at a particular time point, for example to measure prescribing quality or the impact of medication use on clinical outcomes. We performed a systematic review of studies that examined methods to assess medications in use at a specific point in time. METHODS Comprehensive literature search to identify studies that compared active medications identified using pharmacy databases to medications identified using nonautomated data sources. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text material. RESULTS Of 496 studies screened, 29 studies evaluating 50 comparisons met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine comparisons evaluated fixed look-back period approaches, defining active medications as those filled in a specified period prior to the index date (range 84-730 days). Fourteen comparisons evaluated medication-on-hand approaches, defining active medications as those for which the most recent fill provided sufficient supply to last through the study index date. Sensitivity ranged from 48% to 93% for fixed look-back period approaches and 35% to 97% for medication-on-hand approaches. Interpretation of comparative performance of methods was limited by use of different reference sources, target medication classes, and databases across studies. In four studies with head-to-head comparisons of these methods, sensitivity of the medication-on-hand approach was a median of 7% lower than the corresponding fixed look-back approach. CONCLUSIONS The reported accuracy of methods for identifying active medications using pharmacy databases differs greatly across studies. More direct comparisons of common approaches are needed to establish the accuracy of methods within and across populations, medication classes, and databases.

Maximum information density: The complete hexanucleotide sequence space can be immobilized on a chip. The binding of a number of proteins was profiled with this array of 4096 sequences, including fluorescently labeled forms of the HIV‐2 and HIV‐1 reverse transciptases (the consensus motif is shown in the picture). This new technique should aid in the search for pharmaceutical lead compunds.[Image: see text]

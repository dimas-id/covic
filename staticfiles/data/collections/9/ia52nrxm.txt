Abstract Just like Internet shopping, TV shopping as an emerging powerful channel of distribution has shown substantial growth in sales and in the number of customers over the past decade. Compared to Internet shopping, the consumer behavior of TV shopping is nonetheless neglected. This paper sheds light on the consumer behavior of TV travel product shopping and specifically investigates the relationships between perceived value, satisfaction, and loyalty of TV shoppers. The findings reveal that in general only the effect of perceived value, but not satisfaction, on loyalty is supported. Furthermore, the consumer product involvement shows its moderating effects on the value–satisfaction–loyalty model.

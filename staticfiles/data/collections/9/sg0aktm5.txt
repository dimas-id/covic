Minimally invasive surgery continues to evolve, and with the advent of single-port laparoscopic access incisionless stoma, creation is possible. Outlined below is the technical approach to the incisionless stoma. It can be applied to the construction of ileostomies as well as colostomies, end, or loop stomas. Our early experience reveals favorable outcomes. This is perhaps one of the least technically demanding procedures that can be performed through a single incision laparoscopic port.

Relatively high levels of antibody to human enteric coronavirus-like particles were detected in the sera from rural Aborigines in Australia. Levels were generally much lower in the sera from urban Aborigines, and extremely low to not detectable in the sera from Europeans. Antibody to coronavirus-like particles was also detected in the sera from rural blacks from South Africa, in the sera from Indonesia and Niue, and also possibly in the sera from rural villagers from Papua New Guinea, but in the latter case at only very low level.

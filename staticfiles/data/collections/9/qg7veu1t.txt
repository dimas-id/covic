BACKGROUND Cyanoacrylate glues are tissue adhesive with high adherent and hemostatic properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyanoacrylates glue for polypropylene-polyvinylidene fluoride (PP-PVDF) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) fixation in a rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 40 New Zealand white rabbits, three pieces (3×3cm) of a PP-PVDF mesh (n=120) were fixed in IPOM technique on both sides of a midline laparotomy. For mesh fixation we used spiral tacks, nonabsorbable sutures, or cyanoacrylate glue in a randomized manner. All animals were killed after 12 wk. The prosthetic materials were excised en bloc with the anterior abdominal wall for evaluation of the tensile strength and histologic analysis. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. RESULTS Meshes fixed with glue showed a significantly higher tenacity of adhesions (2.75±0.97) compared with those with tacks (2.44±0.97 sutures versus 1.91±0.92 tacks). The percentage of adhesions in the glue group was comparable to the suture group (36.50% ± 27.60% glue, 37.62% ± 27.36% suture). The tensile strength of stapled and sutured meshes was significantly higher than the tensile strength glued mesh (14.15±0.97N suture versus 14.84±0.74 stapler versus 9.64±0.78N glue). Mesh shrinkage was irrespective of the fixation technique. The inflammation reaction was more pronounced in the glue group. CONCLUSIONS Although cyanoacrylate glue showed a considerable cellular ingrowth in this rabbit model, sutures and tacks proved to be superior for IPOM fixation of PP-PVDF meshes in terms of tensile strength.

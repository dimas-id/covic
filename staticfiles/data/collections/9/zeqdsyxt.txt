Abstract The reaction of ethyl dibromofluoroacetate with imines using zinc metal gave 2-fluoroaziridine-2-carboxylates via aza-Darzens reaction of the primary product of the Reformatsky reaction with high diastereoselectivity in excellent yields (quantitative yield and Dr=85:15). This chemoselective formation of 2-fluoroaziridines was achieved by using CH3CN as a solvent. Interestingly, the reaction proceeded without activation of zinc metal, which was necessary for the Reformatsky reaction of bromodifluoroacetate. None of α-bromo-α-fluoro-β-lactams, four-membered cyclization products, and noncyclized 3-amino-2-bromo-2-fluorocarboxylic esters, usual Reformatsky adducts, were formed.

The amphipod Dikerogammarus haemobaphes is a high-risk carrier of parasites that impact wildlife in its non-native range. Studies using the mitochondrial genes, Cytochrome Oxidase Sub-Unit 1 (cox1) and small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S), provide some nucleotide detail for understanding the evolution and phylogeography of this species. Despite this, the origins of the invasion remain unknown, as do the origins of its parasites. This study provides the full annotated mitochondrial genome (15,460 bp) of D. haemobaphes, consisting of 2 rRNAs, 24 tRNAs and 14 protein coding genes. Mitochondrial genes from the UK isolate are compared to existing data on NCBI and are used in a concatenated phylogenetic approach and identify D. haemobaphes as an early member of the Gammaridae (Amphipoda). Viral, bacterial, protistan and microsporidian parasites are present across the Gammaridae, including D. haemobaphes, suggesting the ancestor of the Gammaridae harboured related diseases, and that further screening of amphipods is likely to reveal further microparasite diversity. This correlation suggests that other gammarid invaders have the potential to harbour a range of microparasites. The mitochondrial genome of this species will act a resource to facilitate our understanding of geneflow, disease epidemiology and evolutionary history in this invasion-disease model.

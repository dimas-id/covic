COVID‐19, which appeared to originate in China in December 2019, has spread worldwide pandemically. Recently, a letter regarding COVID‐19 impact on dentistry has been published in this Journal (Prati et al. 2020). In Europe, Italy is the second most affected nation by COVID‐19 infection and the first for number of deaths (WHO SR). In March 2020, the Italian Ministry of Health ordered the suspension of all non‐urgent outpatient activities (including dentistry) in hospitals and clinics of the public health system, until the end of the lockdown (Press releases Italian Ministry of Health, 1).

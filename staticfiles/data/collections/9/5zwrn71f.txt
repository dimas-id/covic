INTRODUCTION A 90-year-old patient was admitted with a hemorrhagic shock from a huge ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with an unfavourable infrarenal aortic neck and a horseshoe kidney (HSK). REPORT We decided on an open surgical approach: the HSK isthmus was sectioned with an Endo GIA 45 mm, and we performed a suprarenal aortic cross-clamping and an aortic graft reconstruction. Postoperatively, no urinary leakage was detected, and renal function showed no impairment. The patient died on the 10th postoperative day from pneumonia. CONCLUSION We believe that the sectioning of the HSK isthmus with Endo GIA is a fast and simple maneouvre.

PURPOSE: To compare and analyze the clinical and CT features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among four different age groups. METHODS: 97 patients (45 males, 52 females, mean age, 66.2 ± 5.0) with chest CT examination and positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) from January 17, 2020 to February 21, 2020 were retrospectively studied. The patients were divided into four age groups (children [0–17 years], young adults [18–44 years], middle age [45–59 years], and senior [≥ 60 years]) according to their age after the diagnosis was made based on PCR test and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease are more common in the senior group. Cluster onset (two or more confirmed cases in a small area) is more common in the children group and senior group. Older patients were found to have a higher incidence of the highest clinical classification (severe or critical) in these four groups. Senior patients have a higher incidence of large/multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO). Child patients are mostly negative for chest CT or with involvement of only one lobe of the lung; while in older patients, there was a higher incidence of involvement of four or five lung lobes. The frequency of lobe involvement was also found to have significant differences in the four age groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical and imaging features of patients in different age groups were found to be significantly different. A better understanding of the age differences in comorbidities, cluster onset, highest clinical classification, large/multiple GGO, numbers of lobes affected, and frequency of lobe involvement can be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients of different ages.

Viruses fully emerge by gaining the ability to sustainably infect new host populations. When the hosts are humans, emerging viruses can present major public health issues, as exemplified by the AIDS pandemic. Therefore, heuristic approaches to identify nascent diseases before they become pandemic would be valuable. Unfortunately, the current patient-based and epidemiological approaches are ill-suited in this regard because they are largely responsive and not predictive. Alternative approaches based on virus evolutionary ecology might have greater potential to predict virus emergence. However, given the difficulties encountered when studying metazoan viruses in this context, the development of new model systems is greatly desirable. Here, I highlight studies that show that bacteriophages are appropriate model organisms for virus emergence research because of the ease in which important population parameters can be manipulated. Ideally this research will permit identifying major factors determining the persistence or extinction of emerging viruses. If such viruses could be recognized in advance, patient-based and epidemiological strategies could be better mobilized to deal with them.

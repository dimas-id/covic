BACKGROUND The use of the self-gripping mesh (Progripâ„¢) during laparoscopic inguinal hernia has been proved to be effective and eliminates the need of additional fixation. However, the deployment of the self-gripping mesh is challenging due to its adhesive property. The purpose of this study was to introduce and describe an easy self-gripping mesh deployment method in laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. METHODS The self-gripping mesh was folded bilaterally towards the center of the mesh and placed vertically to align with the inferior epigastric artery, centered on the internal defect, then unfolded in a horizontal-bilateral unfolding method, first laterally, then medially. RESULTS A total of 63 inguinal hernias were repaired laparoscopicly: 40 patients by TAPP or TEP technique with self-gripping mesh, and there were no perioperative complications. The average time of mesh placement was 186 s (45-250 s). The patients only feel minimal pain (less than VAS 3) the second postoperative morning, and most of the patients were discharged the next day postoperatively; the average postoperative hospital duration was 1 day (1-2 days). CONCLUSION The present "horizontal-bilateral unfolding" mesh deployment method is a relative easy method to implant the self-gripping mesh during laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

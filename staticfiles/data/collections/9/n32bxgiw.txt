Colostral and milk whey rotavirus (RV) and coronavirus (CV) antibody titers stimulated in 15 beef heifers by vaccination with a modified live-RV-CV vaccine were compared with titers in 15 nonvaccinated heifers. Geometric mean antibody titers to RV in colostral and 3-day milk whey from vaccinated heifers were 2,807 and 92, respectively, and in control heifers were 1,613 and 71, respectively. Geometric mean antibody titers to CV in colostral and 3-day milk whey of vaccinated heifers were 877 and 13, respectively, compared with titers were 877 and 13, respectively, compared with titers in nonvaccinated heifers of 731 and 7, respectively. Differences in antibody titers between vaccinated and nonvaccinated heifers were not significantly different.

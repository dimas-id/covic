This chapter explains laboratory techniques for diagnosis of virus infections. An exact virological diagnosis is necessary for studies of the epidemiology of viral infections and for the control of epidemics and nosocomial infections. Most known viruses causing disease in man can be demonstrated by use of cell cultures or experimental animals. The virus infection is indicated by the more or less characteristic changes that the virus causes in cell cultures or by the appearance of disease in experimental animals. The cells of different origin and age may have a markedly varying susceptibility to different viruses. For diagnostic purposes a virus laboratory must therefore have access to a battery of cell lines from animals and man. It is pointed out that demonstration, by use of laboratory techniques; of a virus infection in a patient does not necessarily imply that this infection is the cause of the patient's disease. Many viruses often give inapparent infections or are excreted for a long time after the acute disease.

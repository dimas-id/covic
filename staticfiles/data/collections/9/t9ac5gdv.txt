OBJECTIVES Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for patients with severe respiratory failure is increasingly common. There has been a significant change in the population, technology, and approach used for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over the last 10 years. The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence of postdecannulation deep vein thrombosis in the cannulated vessel in adults who have received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure. DESIGN A single-center, retrospective, observational cohort, electronic note review study. SETTING Tertiary referral university teaching hospital. PATIENTS Patients commenced on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We identified 103 patients commenced on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with 81 survivors from December 2011 to February 2014. We performed postdecannulation venous Doppler ultrasound in 88.9% of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors. The prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in the cannulated vessel following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is 8.1/1,000 cannula days in patients who were screened. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of deep vein thrombosis following decannulation from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure is clinically significant, and routine venous Doppler ultrasound following decannulation is warranted in this population.

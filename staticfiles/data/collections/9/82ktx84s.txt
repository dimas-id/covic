BACKGROUND The effect of bariatric surgery on iron absorption is only partially known. OBJECTIVE The objective was to study the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on heme- and nonheme-iron absorption and iron status. DESIGN Fifty-eight menstruating women were enrolled in this prospective study [mean (±SD) age: 35.9 ± 9.1 y; weight: 101.7 ± 13.5 kg; BMI (in kg/m²): 39.9 ± 4.4]. Anthropometric, body-composition, dietary, and hematologic indexes and heme- and nonheme-iron absorption-using a standardized meal containing 3 mg Fe-were determined before and 12 mo after surgery. Forty-three subjects completed the 12-mo follow-up. Iron supplements were strictly controlled. RESULTS Heme-iron absorption was 23.9% before and 6.2% 12 mo after surgery (P < 0.0001). Nonheme-iron absorption decreased from 11.1% to 4.7% (P < 0.0001). No differences were observed by type of surgery. Iron intakes from all sources of supplements were 27.9 ± 6.2 mg/d in the SG group and 63.2 ± 21.1 mg/d in the RYGBP group (P < 0.001). Serum ferritin and total-body iron decreased more after RYGBP than after SG. CONCLUSIONS Iron (heme and nonheme) absorption is markedly reduced after SG and RYGBP. The magnitude of the decrease in heme-iron absorption is greater than that of nonheme iron. The amounts suggested as iron supplements may need to be increased to effectively prevent iron-status impairment.

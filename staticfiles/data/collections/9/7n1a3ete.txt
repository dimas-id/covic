When interferons (IFNs) bind to their receptors, they upregulate numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral and immune regulatory activities. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that affects over 71 million people in the global population. Hepatocytes infected with HCV produce types I and III IFNs. These endogenous IFNs upregulate a set of ISGs that negatively impact the outcome of pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin treatments, which were previously used to treat HCV. In addition, the IFNL4 genotype was the primary polymorphism responsible for a suboptimal treatment response to pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin. However, recently developed direct-acting antivirals have demonstrated a high rate of sustained virological response without pegylated IFN-α. Herein, we review recent studies on types I and III IFN responses in HCV-infected hepatocytes. In particular, we focused on open issues related to IFN responses in the direct-acting antiviral era.

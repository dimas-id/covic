The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality for patients and stressed healthcare systems worldwide. The clinical features, disease course, and serologic response of COVID‐19 among immunosuppressed patients such as solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, who are at presumed risk for more severe disease, are not well characterized. We describe our institutional experience with COVID‐19 among ten SOT patients, including the clinical presentation, treatment modalities, and outcomes of seven renal transplant recipients, one liver transplant recipient, one heart transplant recipient, and one lung transplant recipient. In addition, we report the serologic response in SOT recipients, documenting a positive IgG response in all seven hospitalized patients. We also review the existing literature on COVID‐19 in SOT recipients to consolidate the current knowledge on COVID‐19 in the SOT population for the transplant community.

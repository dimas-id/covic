OBJECTIVE To compare leak pressures following simple continuous closure of cystotomy with barbed suture to an analogous monofilament suture, in an ex vivo canine model. STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo, simple randomized study. ANIMALS OR SAMPLE POPULATION Urinary bladders harvested from canine cadavers (n = 21). METHODS Urinary bladders were harvested from cadavers immediately following euthanasia. A 3-cm cystotomy was made on ventral midline of the urinary bladder. Urinary bladders were randomly assigned a suture for closure. A digital pressure transducer was inserted through 1 ureter, and the other ligated, while colored isotonic saline was infused into the urinary bladder via a Foley catheter inserted in the urethra. The initial leak pressure was defined as the pressure at which the colored saline solution first leaked from the cystotomy, and the maximum leak pressure was recorded when the pressure reached a plateau or catastrophic failure occurred. A Welch's 2-sample t test was used to compare leak pressure between the barbed and non-barbed closures, with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the initial or maximum leak pressure between the barbed and non-barbed closures. CONCLUSIONS This study showed no difference in initial or maximum leak pressure between cystotomy closures with barbed or non-barbed suture under ex vivo conditions. This indicates barbed suture may be appropriate for cystotomy closure but in vivo studies are needed to support this finding.

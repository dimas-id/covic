H9N2 influenza viruses circulate in wild birds and poultry in Eurasian countries, and have been isolated from pigs and humans in China. H9N2 viruses isolated from birds, pigs and humans have been classified into three sublineages based on antigenic and genetic features. Chicken antisera to H9N2 viruses of the Korean sublineage reacted with viruses of different sublineages by the hemagglutination-inhibition test. A test vaccine prepared from a non-pathogenic A/duck/Hokkaido/49/1998 (H9N2) strain of the Korean sublineage, obtained from our influenza virus library, induced immunity in mice to reduce the impact of disease caused by the challenge with A/Hong Kong/1073/1999 (H9N2), which is of a different sublineage. The present results indicate that an inactivated whole virus vaccine prepared from a non-pathogenic influenza virus from the library could be used as an emergency vaccine during the early stage of a pandemic caused by H9N2 infection.

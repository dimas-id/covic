In the search for new antitumor agents, aminophosphonic acids and their derivatives based on octahydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-one scaffold were obtained and their cytotoxic properties and a mechanism of action were evaluated. Phosphonic acid and phosphonate moieties increased the antiproliferative activity in comparison to phenolic Mannich bases previously reported. Most of the obtained compounds revealed a strong antiproliferative effect against leukemia cell line (MV-4-11) with simultaneous low cytotoxicity against normal cell line (mouse fibroblasts-BALB/3T3). The most active compound was diphenyl-[(1R,6R)-3-oxo-2,5-diazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-4-yl]phosphonate. Preliminary evaluation of the mechanism of action showed the proapoptotic effect associated with caspase 3/7 induction.

Early detection of peritoneal changes is essential for the management of several neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions in veterinary patients. The peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces are normally included in abdominal MDCT examination. Contrast-enhanced MDCT scans with near-isotropic or isotropic resolution are necessary for fine evaluation of the abdominal cavity in dogs and cats. Isotropic imaging and post-processing with dorsal and sagittal reformation can fully delineate the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces and extent of diseases.

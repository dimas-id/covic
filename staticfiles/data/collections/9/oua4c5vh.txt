Although it is not uncommon for patients with Chiari I malformations to present with respiratory complaints, cough syncope is a rare presenting symptom. We report an adult patient who harbored both a Chiari I malformation and atlanto-occipital assimilation who complained of cough syncope, orthopnea, and central sleep apnea. The patient underwent decompressive craniectomy of the posterior fossa and cervical level 2 laminectomy. However, due to a possible initial underappreciation of the profound narrowing of the foramen magnum as a result of these concomitant pathologies, the patient may have had continued impaired cerebrospinal fluid flow, leading to a symptomatic pseudomeningocele and requiring a more extensive decompression that included a cervical level 3 laminectomy as well as a temporary lumbar drain. On 2-year follow-up, he has remained asymptomatic.

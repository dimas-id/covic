Bats are the only flying placental mammals that constitute the second largest order of mammals and present all around the world except in Arctic, Antarctica and a few oceanic islands. Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases originating from animals are zoonotic and more than two-thirds of them originate in wildlife. Bats were evolved as a super-mammal for harboring many of the newly identified deadly diseases without any signs and lesions. Their unique ability to fly, particular diet, roosting behavior, long life span, ability to echolocate and critical susceptibility to pathogens make them suitable host to harbor numerous zoonotic pathogens like virus, bacteria and parasite. Many factors are responsible for the emergence of bat borne zoonoses but the most precipitating factor is human intrusions. Deforestation declined the natural habitat and forced the bats and other wild life to move out of their niche. These stressed bats, having lost foraging and behavioral pattern invade in proximity of human habitation. Either directly or indirectly they transmit the viruses to humans and animals. Development of fast detection modern techniques for viruses from the diseased and environmental samples and the lessons learned in the past helped in preventing the severity during the latest outbreaks.

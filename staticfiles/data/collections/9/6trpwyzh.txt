Epitopes are defined as the molecular structures interacting with specific receptors of the immune system such as antibodies, MHC, and T cell receptor molecules. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB, http://www.immuneepitope.org) is a database specifically devoted to immune epitope data. The database is populated with intrinsic and context-dependent epitope data curated from the scientific literature by immunologists, biochemists, and microbiologists. An analysis resource is linked to the database which hosts various bioinformatics tools to analyze epitope data as well as to predict de novo epitopes. The availability of the IEDB will facilitate the exploration of immunity to infectious diseases, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. The utility of the IEDB was recently demonstrated through a comprehensive analysis of all current information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes derived from influenza A and determining possible cross-reactivity among H5N1 avian flu and human flu viruses.

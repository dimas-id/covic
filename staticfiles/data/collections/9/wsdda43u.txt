Abstract The mRNA encoding the 49-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N) of the bovine coronavirus is bicistronic. A 23-kDa protein, termed the I protein for the ‘internal’ open reading frame (ORF), is also synthesized but in the +1 reading frame beginning 61 nt downstream of the N start codon. Sequences flanking the N and I start codons suggest that the I ORF might be accessed by scanning ribosomes passing over the N start codon. Here we test this idea and demonstrate with translation studies both in vitro and in vivo that the I protein is synthesized according to the leaky scanning model for initiation of translation on the subgenomic N mRNA molecule.

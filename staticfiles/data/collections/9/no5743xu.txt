OBJECTIVE To evaluate the feasibility of training program in video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy comparing intraoperative and postoperative data of patients operated on by an established consultant and trainees. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 100 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomies between May 2008 and May 2012. 66 patients were operated on by an established consultant (Group A) and 34 by trainees (Group B). RESULTS The groups were comparable for clinical characteristics and pathological staging. The mean operating time in Group A was 125 ± 30 min and in Group B was 133 ± 26 min (p = 0.18). The rate of conversion was similar in both groups: 9.1% in Group A and 8.8% in Group B (p = 0.6). The complication rate was comparable (p = 0.4): 36.3% in Group A and 32.3% in Group B. Median time to drain removal and median length of hospital stay was 3 and 5.5 days in Group A and 3 and 5 days in Group B, showing no statistical differences between the two groups (p = 0.3 and 0.5). There were no differences in term of long-term complications between the two groups. CONCLUSION Our study showed that a training program in VATS lobectomy is feasible, without increasing the operative time, conversion rate, postoperative complication, time to drain removal, and length of hospital stay.

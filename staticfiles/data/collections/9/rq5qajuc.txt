BACKGROUND For some common conditions, pre-operative clinic visits are often of little value to the patient or surgeon with transfer to the waiting list being predictable. In response to local patient feedback, we introduced a single hospital visit laparoscopic hernia surgery pathway with focus on informed consent, patient-reported outcomes and post-operative interaction with primary care services. METHODS A single hospital visit service for elective hernia repairs was created. Patients were not excluded on age, BMI or co-morbidity. Following referral, patients were telephoned by a surgeon. If considered appropriate, a symptom assessment tool, procedure information and consent form were sent. All patients were operated without attending clinic or pre-operative assessment. Surgeon-led telephone follow-up was made at either 2 or 7 days post-operatively and patient satisfaction assessed at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 517 patients were referred for single-stop surgery between 2012 and 2015. Median age was 58 (range 20-92), 91 % were male, and mean BMI was 25.6 (17.4-52.0). No patient refused the single-visit pathway. Single-stop patients had higher knowledge questionnaire scores (mean 16 vs. 10, p = 0.01) than patients who had attended clinic. Nine (1.7 %) were requested to attend clinic to confirm diagnosis, and three (0.8 %) were cancelled by their surgeon on the operative day. A total of 393 hernia repairs (331 TEP, 63 open) were performed under general anaesthetic. 92 % were discharged on day zero. Telephone follow-up day two rather than seven decreased attendance to primary care services (25 % vs. 57 %, p = 0.001). At 3 months, 95 % were satisfied and symptom scores were reduced (median 5-0, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Single-visit surgery appears to extend the patient benefits of laparoscopy by reducing hospital visits without compromising safety. Single hospital visit hernia surgery for unselected primary care referrals is possible and acceptable to patients.

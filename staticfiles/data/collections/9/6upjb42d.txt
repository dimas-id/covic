Despite the advantages of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair over the open approach in selected situations, laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) remains a challenge to teach and learn. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a low-cost adaptable simulator for evaluation and training of LIHR. McGill Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Simulator (MLIHS) is a physical simulator that accurately represents inguinal anatomy. MLIHS permits to perform both transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repairs. Six experienced surgeons performed TAPP repairs using MLIHS. They were surveyed to establish face validity, and were scored using a previously validated global rating scale (maximum score = 25). Experienced surgeons considered MLIHS a useful tool for evaluating and training of LIHR. The mean (SD) global rating scores were 24.0 (Â± 0.6). The experienced surgeons considered MLIHS very useful for training and assessment. MLIHS is a valuable and affordable tool for training and evaluation of LIHR.

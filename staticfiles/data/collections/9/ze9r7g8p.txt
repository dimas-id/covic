OBJECTIVE Evaluate the efficacy of Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) in managing suicide risk and deliberate self-harm in adults. METHODS Ten databases were searched for publications referring to CAMS or the Suicide Status Form. Results were evaluated by two reviewers. RESULTS Limited evidence that CAMS is effective in reducing suicide risk and deliberate self-harm in adult populations. CONCLUSIONS Although CAMS appears to show promise in managing suicidal patients across a range of measures, further evidence is needed to clarify its efficacy in managing suicide risk and deliberate self-harm.

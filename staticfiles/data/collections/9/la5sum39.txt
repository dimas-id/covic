Continuous investments in influenza research, surveillance, and prevention efforts are critical to mitigate the consequences of annual influenza epidemics and pandemics. New influenza viruses emerge due to antigenic drift and antigenic shift evading human immune system and causing annual epidemics and pandemics. Three pandemics with varying disease severity occurred in the last 100 years. The disease burden and determinants of influenza severity depend on circulating viral strains and individual demographic and clinical factors. Surveillance is the most effective strategy for appropriate public health response. Active and passive surveillance methods are utilized to monitor influenza epidemics and emergence of novel viruses. Meaningful use of electronic health records could be a cost-effective approach to improved influenza surveillance

Reinforced endostapling can prevent postoperative air leakage from surgical stumps. We herein present a 58-year old woman with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia who developed lethal haemothorax after a thoracoscopic lung biopsy with the use of an endostapler preloaded with bioabsorbable tissue reinforcement material. This lethal haemothorax, which occurred on the day after the lung biopsy, required an emergency operation. The bleeding point was an intercostal artery of the inferior chest wall adjacent to the surgical stump. The operative findings suggested that the reinforced material on the surgical stump scratched the chest wall through respiratory movement.

Cancers of the colon and kidney are common malignancies, however, the occurrence of primary synchronous neoplasms of these two organs is uncommon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a laparoscopic radical left nephrectomy and extended right complete mesocolic excision (CME) for a patient with synchronous renal and colon cancers. While a radical nephrectomy has long been the standard of care for a renal malignancy, CME has only recently been used. Combined surgeries provide the patient with various benefits such as decreased hospital stay, less postoperative pain and morbidity, early return to work and better cosmoses.

The human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) parvovirus causes respiratory disease and primarily affects children. Despite its worldwide prevalence, the mechanisms of HBoV1 replication and pathogenesis remain largely undefined. In this study of 846 children hospitalized at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China for respiratory tract infection between June 2009 and May 2011, HBoV1 was detected in 112 (13.2%) by real-time quantitative PCR. The median age of HBoV1-positive patients was 10 months old. Forty-five (40.2%) of the HBoV1 cases were monoinfections, and 67 (59.8%) were viral co-infections. Genotyping of all 112 HBoV1-positive cases yielded 27 full HBoV1 sequences, as well as two NS1 gene sequences, 15 NP1 gene sequences and 10 VP1/VP2 gene sequences harbouring 24, 10 and 43 mutations, respectively. Statistical analysis revealed no relationship between genetic mutations and clinical manifestations of HBoV1-positive patients. However, the viral loads were significantly lower in samples with mutations G236A or A447G in NP1, or G1461A in VP1/VP2, than in samples with wild-type HBoV1. Future studies should investigate whether these mutations in the HBoV1 gene may represent useful markers of disease pathogenesis.

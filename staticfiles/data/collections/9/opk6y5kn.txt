Dendritic cells (DCs) are known to be the most powerful professional antigen-presenting cells so far. It could activate primary immune response, and also downregulate immune response. DCs have a unique character of immunoregulation. DC-SIGN, a molecule designated as CD209, is one member of the C-type lectin superfamily. It is not only a pattern recognition receptor but implicated in immunoregulation of DCs. DC-SIGN has become hotspot of recent studies because of its important role in mediating DC adhesion, migration, inflammation, activating primary T cell, triggering immune response and participating in immune escape of pathogens and tumors. These studies on DC-SIGN involved in primary and secondary immune response and relevant mechanism will certainly provide us with a new method in treating and preventing certain diseases.

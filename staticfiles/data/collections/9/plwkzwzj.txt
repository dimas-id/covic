In this manuscript, we describe a significant advantage of the intraoperative near infrared spectroscopic techniques (NIRS) using in a malignant hypertensive patient during kidney transplantation. This patient underwent operation becasue of the presence of a suitable cadaveric kidney. Moreover, although the patient's hypertension was intensively treated by cardiology for a long time, it could not be controlled. Thus, despite severe hypertension, the patient was anaesthetized. Mean arterial pressures of about 70-90 mmHg, which are considered to be normal for most people, could cause cerebral hypoperfusion in such a patient. It is a significant advantage that the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation is quickly assessed by NIRS in the case of a kidney transplant performed under general anaesthesia.

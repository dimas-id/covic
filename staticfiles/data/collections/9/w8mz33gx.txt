Resistant systemic hypertension in patients is defined as the inability to control blood pressure despite taking at least three antihypertensive drugs, one of which is a diuretic. Two nonpharmacologic approaches are being evaluated in resistant hypertensive patients. First, the RheosÂ® Baroreflex Hypertension Therapy system is an implantable device that activates the carotid baroreflex through electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus wall. Sustained and clinically lower blood pressure has been observed in patient clinical trials. The second approach is a catheter-based strategy which denervates the renal afferent and efferent autonomic nervous system. This strategy has also been shown to be effective in drug-resistant patients, and has also been shown to decrease renin production, preserve renal function, improve glucose tolerance, and reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. Both carotid sinus stimulation and renal denervation are now being evaluated in clinical trials for the long-term control of hypertension.

In order to adapt port rapid detection of food borne norovirus, presently we developed a new typed detection method based on F(0)F(1)-ATPase molecular motor biosensor. A specific probe was encompassed the conservative region of norovirus and F(0)F(1)-ATPase within chromatophore was constructed as a molecular motor biosensor through the “ε-subunit antibody-streptomycin-biotin-probe” system. Norovirus was captured based on probe-RNA specific binding. Our results demonstrated that the Limit of Quantification (LOQ) is 0.005 ng/mL for NV RNA and also demonstrated that this method possesses specificity and none cross-reaction for food borne virus. What’s more, the experiment used this method could be accomplished in 1 h. We detected 10 samples by using this method and the results were consistent with RT-PCR results. Overall, based on F(0)F(1)-ATPase molecular motors biosensor system we firstly established a new typed detection method for norovirus detection and demonstrated that this method is sensitive and specific and can be used in the rapid detection for food borne virus.

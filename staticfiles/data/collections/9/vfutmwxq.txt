Publisher Summary Coronaviruses have recently emerged as an important group of animal and human pathogens that share a distinctive replicative cycle. Some of the unique characteristics in the replication of coronaviruses include generation of a 3' coterminal-nested set of five or six subgenomic mRNAs, each of which appears to direct the synthesis of one protein. Two virus-specific RNA polymerase activities have been identified. Many of the distinctive features of coronavirus infection and coronavirus-induced diseases may result from the properties of the two coronavirus glycoproteins. The intracellular budding site, which may be important in the establishment and maintenance of persistent infections, appears to be due to the restricted intracytoplasmic migration of the E1 glycoprotein, which acts as a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein. E1 also exhibits distinctive behavior by self-aggregating on heating at 100Â°C in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and by its interaction with RNA in the viral nucleocapsid. The E1 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an O-linked glycoprotein, unlike most other viral glycoproteins. Thus, the coronavirus system may be a useful model for the study of synthesis, glycosylation, and transport of O-linked cellular glycoproteins.

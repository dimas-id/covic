Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emerged globally. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface is crucial for SARS-COV-2 entering into the cells. The expression of ACE2 in skin suggested that skin might be a way of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. We found the elevated ACE2 level of patients with psoriasis but downregulated after IL-17 antibody treatment. Further results showed that ACE2 expression increased either in psoriasis or in atopic dermatitis, which were typical inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction. And elevated ACE2 level was also detected in mouse models of dermatitis induced by imiquimod, calcipotriol, repeated tape-stripping or 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB) respectively. Moreover, alleviation of cutaneous inflammation with skin recovery moisture also lowered expression of ACE2 in mouse models with barrier deteriorated inflammatory skin disorders. Furthermore, inflammatory skin disorders with barrier dysfunction increased the penetration of topical FITC conjugated spike protein into the skin. Conversely, improvement in skin permeability barrier could prevent this penetration. Thus, indicating the special link between inflammatory skin disorders with skin barrier dysfunction and increasing risk of COVID-19.

Reported shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the NHS have caused anxiety amongst healthcare workers [1]. Several designs for improvised PPE have been circulated online and via social media. One particularly widely shared design involves a 3D printed adaptor to allow the mating of a standard anaesthetic heat and moisture exchange (HME) filter to a commercially available snorkelling mask. Thingiverse, an online repository of 3D printable files, contains at least 18 adaptor designs that users can download [2].

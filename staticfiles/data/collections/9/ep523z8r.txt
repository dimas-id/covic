PURPOSE OF REVIEW High-resolution manometry (HRM) is increasingly performed worldwide, to study esophageal motility. The Chicago classification is subsequently applied to interpret the manometric findings and facilitate a diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders. This review will discuss new insights regarding the diagnosis and management using the Chicago classification. RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies have demonstrated that high-resolution manometry is superior to conventional manometry, and has a higher sensitivity to diagnose achalasia. Furthermore, the subclassification of achalasia as used in the Chicago classification has prognostic value and can be used to direct treatment. Diagnosis of esophageal spasm has been improved by using the distal latency as diagnostic criterion. Recently, criteria for minor disorders of peristalsis have been sharpened, leading to a lower rate of patients with abnormal results, thereby increasing the relevance of a diagnosis. High-resolution manometry is now considered the gold standard for diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders. The Chicago classification provides a standardized approach for analysis and categorization of abnormalities that has led to a significant increase in our knowledge regarding the diagnosis and management of motility disorders. Further refinement of the classification will be required.

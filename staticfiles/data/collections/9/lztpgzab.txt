Antibody-mediated immunity (AMI) has been used for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases for > 100 years, and has a remarkable record of safety, efficacy and versatility. AMI can be used for defence against a wide variety of biological weapons, and passive antibody (Ab) therapy has the potential to provide immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. Recent advances in the Ab field make it possible to generate Abs with enhanced antimicrobial functions. There are significant gaps in our understanding of Ab function, such that the development of Ab-based strategies remains a largely empirical exercise. Nevertheless, the advantages inherent in the therapeutic and prophylactic use of AMI provide a powerful rationale for continued development that will undoubtedly yield many new vaccines and therapeutic Abs.

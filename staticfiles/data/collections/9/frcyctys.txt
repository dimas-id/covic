To investigate the cause of differences among ecological plant groups in the east of the Elborz mountain rangeland, the role of edaphical and topographical characteristics was considered. Two ordination techniques, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), were used. The values of slope, aspect, altitude and lithology information were provided by Geographic Information System (GIS), and geomorphological land units were determined by intersection of overlaid data layers. Plant sampling was undertaken within nine land units with similar lithology and altitude but which differed in slope and aspect, using 30 randomly selected 1 m(2) plots per land unit. Soil samples were taken from two depths (0–20 and 20–50 cm) in each plot. Organic matter, bulk density, texture, calcium carbonate, total nitrogen and available phosphorus and potassium contents were determined. The results indicated that plant species have different responses to edaphical and topographical parameters. The invader species group had a balanced amount of influence from all soil components and topographic factors, whereas the native grasses were located in productive soils, which typically have a low grazing intensity, such as the north facing slopes. Coniferous bushy trees, cushion plants and some shrub plant groups were found on steep slopes with alkaline soils. The broad‐leaved bushy trees plant group was abundant in fine texture soils on low and humid slopes.

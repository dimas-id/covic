Abstract Viral diseases continue to pose some of the greatest challenges to modern medicine. For many viral diseases, prophylactic vaccines are unlikely to be developed in the near future. Fortunately, effective antiviral therapies have been developed for many of these viruses. In this review, I will focus on antiviral therapy for herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and human papillomavirus. The development of compounds targeting these viruses illustrates many of the principles driving current antiviral development. It is likely that our increasing understanding of viral replication and the virus-host interaction will lead to more rapid development of new antivirals in the future.

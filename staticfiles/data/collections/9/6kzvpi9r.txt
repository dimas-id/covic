Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are localized mainly in the stomach, and the therapeutic approach is surgical resection. Laparoscopy can be performed for tumors located in the greater curvature of the stomach. Among the treatment alternatives, a single-incision laparoscopic technique is used more frequently than standard laparoscopy due to the successful results of laparoscopic surgery. Here, we report the use of single-incision surgical glove-port laparoscopy for the resection of 2 gastrointestinal stromal tumors localized in the greater curvature of stomach.

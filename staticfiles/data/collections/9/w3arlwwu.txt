Dermatological manifestations have shown to be associated with COVID-19 infections. The numbers of papers have quadrupled within May 2020 alone. One particular cutaneous manifestation named pseudo chilblains (COVID toe), expressed mostly in otherwise asymptomatic younger patients, has had particular media attention. Public health bodies, on the other hand, have been slow to recognize it as a symptom. This article will be discussing two case studies to demonstrate the lack of public knowledge and of public health guidance associated with this symptom. We will further explore the use of COVID toe in the epidemiology of COVID-19 and its utility as a sign for total cases and contact tracing.

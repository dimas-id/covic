The discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) are causing public health emergency. A handful of literatures have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas therapies for COVID‐19 are rather limited. In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID‐19 patients, we did this timely descriptive study. 6 laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 patients were enrolled and received the transfusion of ABO‐compatible convalescent plasma. The efficacy of this intervention was determined by the alleviation of symptoms, changes in radiologic abnormalities and laboratory tests. No obvious adverse effect observed during the treatment. Transfusion of convalescent plasma led to a resolution of ground glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation in patient #1, #2, #3, #4 and #6. In patient #1 and #5 who presented with SARS‐CoV‐2 in throat swab, convalescent plasma therapy elicited an elimination of virus. Serologic analysis indicated an immediate increase in anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody titers in patient #2 and #3, but not in patient #1. This study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is effective and specific for COVID‐19. This intervention has a special significance for eliminating SARS‐CoV‐2 and is believed to be a promising state‐of‐art therapy during COVID‐19 pandemic crisis. This article is protected by copyright.

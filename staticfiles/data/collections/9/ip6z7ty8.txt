Abstract Polyurethane (PU), a honeycomb structure material, was used as a substrate onto which TiO2 and Cu–TiO2 were deposited in order to integrate the adsorption property to the photocatalysts. TiO2 deposited on PU (TiO2/PU) and Cu-doped TiO2 deposited on PU (Cu–TiO2/PU) were synthesized and applied to the removal of Candida famata (C. famata), a frequently encountered airborne yeast. The removal capacities of C. famata by PU, TiO2/PU and Cu–TiO2/PU were 1.5×105, 3.2×105 and 6.9×105 (CFU/cm3) under dark condition and 1.5×105, 3.3×105 and 1.8×106 (CFU/cm3) under visible light irradiation, respectively. PU and TiO2/PU seemed to exhibit only an adsorption ability for removing C. famata in aerosols under both dark and visible light. The C. famata removal capacity of Cu–TiO2/PU under visible light was increased 2.6-fold compared to that under dark condition. This significant increase was attributed to the Cu dopant, which enhanced the electron–hole separation efficiency and capacity of TiO2, resulting in the high photocatalytic activity of Cu–TiO2/PU under visible light.

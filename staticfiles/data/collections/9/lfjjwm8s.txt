TMPRSS11D (HAT) belongs to the large type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, participating in various biological and physiological processes. TMPRSS11D expression has been reported during squamous cell carcinogenesis, however, its expression during non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development has not been studied. In this study, we determined the mRNA and protein expression of TMPRSS11D in NSCLC tumorous and matched adjacent normal tissues by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry analysis (TMA-IHC) respectively. TMPRSS11D protein expression in tumorous tissues were correlated with NSCLC patientsâ€™ clinical characteristics and overall survival. Both TMPRSS11D mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in NSCLC tumorous tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. High TMPRSS11D protein expression was associated with high TNM stages, and high TMPRSS11D protein expression is an independent prognostic marker in NSCLC. Based on our results, we conclude that TMPRSS11D could play a role in NSCLC development and progression. Because of its role in proteolysis of extracellular matrix, targeting TMPRSS11D may prevent the development of metastasis in NSCLC.

Introduction On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), which broke out from Wuhan, China in December 2019, has been increasing rapidly The novel coronavirus infection is designated as a designated infectious disease under Article 6(8) of the Infectious Diseases Act from February 1, 2020 As a general rule, it is mandatory to treat the disease at a designated medical institution for type 1 or type 2 infectious diseases Our center is the only designated medical institution for Type 1 infectious diseases in Wakayama Prefecture and the only designated medical institution for Type 2 infectious diseases in Wakayama City Therefore, patients with novel coronavirus infection or those with a history of infection may be examined and operated on In the absence of clinically specific measures and manuals for the surgery of novel coronavirus-positive patients, our center has decided to operate on patients with a positive viral history (negative at the time of the decision to operate) Prior to surgery, a multi-disciplinary simulation was conducted with a physician from the Department of Infectious Diseases, a certified nurse for infection control, an anesthesiologist, an operating physician, and a certified surgical nurse (presented as a reference at the end of this paper), and a manual for the surgery center was created In addition, the content was updated after patient surgery to reflect on the issues Although this manual has not been proven to be the most reasonable method of dealing with novel coronavirus patients during surgery, many facilities are currently working on the creation of a similar manual based on clinical practice as a matter of urgency, so we have decided to introduce this manual prepared by our center as a resource We would be grateful if you could give us your comments on this manual

INTRODUCTION We investigated whether the peg transfer task is interchangeable between a VR simulator and a box trainer. Our research questions: (1) Are scores of the box trainer interchangeable with the virtual equivalent of the exercise; (2) does training on the box affect performance on the VR simulator and vice versa; and (3) which system is preferred? METHODS Experienced laparoscopists and medical interns were randomly assigned to one of two groups (V or B). They performed eight repetitions of the peg transfer task (4 on each simulator system) following a crossover study design. Group B started on the box trainer and group V started on the VR simulator. Opinion of participants was evaluated by a questionnaire. RESULTS A significant correlation was found between time to complete the task on the box and the VR simulator. The comparison of the performances per system showed that group B (N = 14) performed the peg transfer task on the VR simulator in significantly less time than group V (N = 14; p = 0.014). Overall, the box was preferred over the VR simulator. CONCLUSIONS Although performances on the box trainer and VR simulator were correlated, they were not interchangeable. The results also imply that assessment on the VR simulator after pretraining on the box is acceptable, whereas VR simulator training alone might not suffice to pass an assessment on a box trainer. More research is needed to validate the use of the VR simulator as a FLS and PLUS assessment instrument.

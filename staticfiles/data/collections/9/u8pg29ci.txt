Andrographolide is a diterpene lactone compound extracted from Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F) Nees, which is commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine. Andrographolide has effects of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antivirus, antitumor, and immune regulation and is used in treatment of cardiovascular-cerebrovascular diseases and protection of the liver and gallbladder. Andrographolide water solubility is poor and its bioavailability is low; its pharmacological effects are extensive but weak, so the preparation requirements are strict.

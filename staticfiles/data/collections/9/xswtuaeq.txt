Streptococcus mutans plays an important role in the development of dental caries in humans by synthesizing adhesive insoluble glucans from sucrose by mutansucrase activity. To explore the anti-cariogenic characteristics of rubusoside (Ru), a natural sweetener component in Rubus suavissimus S. Lee (Rosaceae), we investigated the inhibitory effect of Ru against the activity of mutansucrase and the growth of Streptococcus mutans. Ru (50 mM) showed 97% inhibitory activity against 0.1 U/mL mutansucrase of S. mutans with 500 mM sucrose. It showed competitive inhibition with a K(i) value of 1.1 Â± 0.2 mM and IC(50) of 2.3 mM. Its inhibition activity was due to hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions based on molecular docking analysis. Ru inhibited the growth of S. mutans as a bacteriostatic agent, with MIC and MBC values of 6 mM and 8 mM, respectively. In addition, Ru showed synergistic anti-bacterial activity when it was combined with curcumin. Therefore, Ru is a natural anti-cariogenic agent with anti-mutansucrase activity and antimicrobial activity against S. mutans.

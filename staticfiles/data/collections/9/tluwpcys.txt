Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) cerebral oximetry is an established and standard monitoring modality for surgery under extracorporeal circulation with circulatory arrest. It helps to reduce the neurological complication, but in many instances, it becomes not only technically challenging but also is difficult to interpret and take corrective action based on the NIRS values. In this case study, we aimed to present the inadequacy of cerebral oximetry for detecting neurological complication.

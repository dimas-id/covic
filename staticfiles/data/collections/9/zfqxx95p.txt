Background: Unique case of retained needle in the AirSeal trocar during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Case Presentation: A 68-year-old male with prostate cancer underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Upon laparoscopic removal of final intra-abdominal suture by bedside assistant, needle became dislodged from suture and was unable to be located after a standard systematic search. Ultimately, needle was found caught in the assistant's AirSeal trocar device. Conclusion: Intraoperative loss of a foreign body should include inspection, and possible radiographic evaluation, of the trocar mechanism as part of a complete systematic approach.

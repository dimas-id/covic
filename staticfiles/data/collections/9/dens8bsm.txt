BACKGROUND Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist (IL-6Ra), can treat cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with observed improvements in COVID-19 case series. RESEARCH QUESTION Can tocilizumab benefit hospitalized COVID-19 patients? STUDY DESIGN and Methods: An observational study of consecutive COVID-19 patients hospitalized from 03.10-31.20 and followed through 04.21.20 was conducted by chart review. Patients were treated with tocilizumab using an algorithm that targeted CRS. Survival and mechanical ventilation (MV) outcomes were reported for 14 days and stratified by disease severity designated at admission (severe, â‰¥3L supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation >93%). For tocilizumab-treated patients, a pre/post analyses of clinical response, biomarkers and safety outcomes was assessed. Post-hoc survival analyses were conducted for race/ethnicity. RESULTS Among 239 patients, median age was 64 years; 36% and 19% were Black and Hispanic, respectively. Hospital census increased exponentially, yet MV census did not. Severe disease was associated with lower survival (78% vs 93%; p<0.001), greater proportion requiring MV (44% vs 5%; p<0.001) and longer median MV days (5.5 vs 1.0; p=0.003). Tocilizumab-treated patients (N=153, 64%) involved 90% of severe patients; 44% of non-severe patients received it for evolving CRS. Tocilizumab-treated patients with severe disease had higher admission hsCRP levels (120 vs 71mg/L; p<0.001), received tocilizumab sooner (2 vs 3 days; p<0.001), but survival was similar to non-severe patients (83% vs 91%; p=0.11). For tocilizumab-treated patients requiring MV, survival was 75% (95%CI=64%-89%). After tocilizumab, few adverse events occurred, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., hsCRP, IL-6) improved; however, D-dimer and sIL2R levels increased significantly. Survival in Blacks and Hispanics, after controlling for age, was significantly higher than in whites (log-rank p=0.002). INTERPRETATION A treatment algorithm that included tocilizumab to target CRS may influence mechanical ventilation and survival outcomes. In tocilizumab-treated patients, oxygenation and inflammatory biomarkers improve with higher than expected survival. Randomized trials must confirm these findings.

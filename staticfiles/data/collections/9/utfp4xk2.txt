The Cantor distribution is obtained from bitstrings; the Cantor-solus distribution (a new name) admits only strings without adjacent 1 bits. We review moments and order statistics associated with these. The Cantor-multus distribution is introduced -- which instead admits only strings without isolated 1 bits -- and more complicated formulas emerge.

Severe traumatic wounds are challenging to manage during surgery. The introduction of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is a breakthrough in wound management. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of VAC on cytokines in wounds during the management of severe traumatic wounds following initial debridement. VAC and conventional wound care (CWC) were independently applied to severe traumatic wounds on pigs. The expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), migration inhibitory factor (MIF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, collagen I and human fibroblast collagenase 1 were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. VAC significantly increased the expression of ICAM-1, MIF, VEGF and collagen I compared with that induced by CWC at the protein and mRNA levels. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that VAC therapy is an effective method for treating severe traumatic wounds, as it increases the expression of cytokines in wounds. VAC significantly increases the expression of ICAM-1, MIF, VEGF and collagen I to manage severe traumatic wounds.

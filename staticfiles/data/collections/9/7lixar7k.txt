An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan has rapidly become a global public health pandemic. As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described priority levels for testing patients with suspected COVID-19 and information on when to seek medical attention. However, there is a paucity of further guidance for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) who may not present with typical symptoms of COVID-19 due to altered physiology. This may pose challenges with surveillance, risk stratification, and initial management of this vulnerable population. In this point-counterpoint discussion, we outline important differences in presentation along with COVID-19 cases co-morbid with SCI.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to analyze Turkish language videos on YouTube about Coronavirus and pregnancy. METHODS YouTube was searched for the following keywords: "Coronavirus, gebelik," "Coronavirus, Hamilelik," "COVID-19, gebelik" and "COVID-19, hamilelik". All ranking data for each video was recorded, video sources and target audiences were analyzed . Videos were designated as "informative, "misleading" "personal experience" and "news update." The usefulness of the videos were analyzed by DISCERN score and the quality of the content was calculated by MICI score. RESULTS Seventy-six videos had a total of 1.494.860 views, with 40.849 likes and 575 dislikes. The source of information in informative videos was physicians (73%), and news agencies (20%), and the majority of these targeted patients. The DISCERN score of videos was 2.9±1, 1.6±0.9, and 1.9±0.9 respectively for respectively for the informative group, personal experience group, and news update group. The mean MICI score for informative videos was low and calculated as 5.3±2.8. CONCLUSION YouTube videos are easily accessible sources of COVID-19 information for pregnant women.

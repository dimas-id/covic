Coronavirus-like particles were visualized in the feces of a young domestic shorthair female cat with diarrhea. On the surface projections, these particles could be distinguished from the enteric coronavirus-like particles of human, dog, cattle and monkey origin. They appeared morphologically similar to a feline enteric coronavirus recently described by other authors. A precipitin antigen was detected in the cat feces by counterimmunoelectroosmophoresis using a rabbit antibovine coronavirus serum.

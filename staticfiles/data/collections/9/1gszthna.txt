Catastrophe modelling began with earthquakes, then expanded to cover windstorms, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other natural hazards, and has evolved in the twenty-first century to cover significant man-made risks like terrorism, and cyber crime. The modelling of man-made risks is reviewed, with particular attention given to the principles of terrorism risk modelling. Pandemic risk is also covered because of its historical linkage with political risk. The application of man-made risk modelling to financial risk transfer is discussed.

All living things are associated with a boundary defined ecological niche. Steady state conditions are rarely constant but evolutionary adaptation is too slow to adapt to daily threats so a surrogate variation mechanism is necessary. The genome defines the most basic instructions for life so that a molecular biology perspective provides the foundation for understanding resilience. Variations in the expression of RNA offers rapid variation and this book proposes this is the basis of resilience. This book attempts to illuminate mechanisms of resilience beginning with elaborating threats leading to disruption in steady state conditions. Recognition of threats and defense systems are described followed by adaptive changes in gene expression that refine responses. Finally, environmental conditions are discussed that serve to dampen the adaptive response oscillator to disruptive threats at the level of RNA expression. This prologue is intended to acquaint the reader with my background and the genesis of optimism for an idea that the benefit of transcriptome plasticity is resilience. I grew up in several National Parks, remote regions of the United States that are set aside to preserve natural environments. I attended 12 schools by the time I graduated from high school, a fact that forced me to develop personal resilience. My career path as a scientist followed a path from ecologist to pharmacologist to molecular biologist. I was a professor that transitioned to biotechnology ensuring research subjects involving very diverse in subject matter so I appreciate the value of plasticity.

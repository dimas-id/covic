We introduce COVIDep (https://COVIDep.ust.hk), a web-based platform that provides immune target recommendations for guiding SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. COVIDep implements a protocol that pools together publicly-available genetic data for SARS-CoV-2 and epitope data for SARS-CoV to identify B cell and T cell epitopes that present potential immune targets for SARS-CoV-2. Correspondences between outputs of COVIDep and immune responses recorded in COVID-19 patients and preclinical vaccine trials are also indicated. The platform is user-friendly, flexible, and based on up-to-date data. It may help guide vaccine designs and associated experimental studies for SARS-CoV-2.

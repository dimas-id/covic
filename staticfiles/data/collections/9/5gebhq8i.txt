Here after performing docking and molecular dynamics of various small molecules derived as a secondary metabolite from fungi, we propose Flaviolin to act as potent inhibitor of 3-chymotrypsin (3C) like protease (3CLpro) of noval corona virus SARS-CoV2 responsible for pandemic condition caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

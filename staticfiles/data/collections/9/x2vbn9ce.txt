The incidence of symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia and bladder outlet obstruction has increased during the last two decades. Most of men are treated conservatively. When medical therapy is inadequate to relief symptoms, surgical treatment is necessary. Absolute indications for surgical treatment are gross hematuria, recurrent urinary infections and retentions as well as bladder stones. With advent of minimally invasive surgery, large prostates tend to be treated either endoscopically or laparoscopically (including robotic assistance). Herein, the robotic-assisted simple prostatectomy is described.

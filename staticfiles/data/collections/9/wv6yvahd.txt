Translational control is widely used to regulate gene expression. This mode of regulation is especially relevant in situations where transcription is silent or when local control over protein accumulation is required. Although many examples of translational regulation have been described, only a few are beginning to be mechanistically understood. Instead of providing a comprehensive account of the examples that are known at present, we discuss instructive cases that serve as paradigms for different modes of translational control.

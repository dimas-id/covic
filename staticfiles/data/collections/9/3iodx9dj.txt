As of May 19, 2020, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) shared evidence indicating an inability for COVID-19 patients having contracted a second infection to spread the virus. Viral samples from re-infected patients could not be grown in culture, a sign of dead virus particles, attributable to neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly, a negative COVID-19 test may no longer be mandated for returning to school or work, or even donating organs. The transplant community should consider lifting donation constraints on patients testing positive for a second COVID-19 infection.

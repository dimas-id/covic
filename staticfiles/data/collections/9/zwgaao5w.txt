We consider how the prolonged, complex and uncertain aftermath of the COVID‚Äê19 crisis will present challenges and opportunities for counselling and psychotherapy. Increased mental strain on populations, individuals and professionals is likely to be compounded by further constraints in therapeutic resources.

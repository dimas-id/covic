INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between slit and non-slit mesh placement in laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair. METHODS This is a retrospective study of 113 patients who underwent laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with Ultrapro mesh between January 2010 and December 2011. Sixty-two and 82 hernias were operated on in the slit mesh and non-slit mesh groups, respectively. Postoperative complications, recurrence, and patient satisfaction levels were evaluated. RESULTS One hernia in the slit mesh group (1/62, 1.6%) and one in the non-slit mesh group (1/82, 1.2%) developed recurrence (P = 1.00). The incidence of postoperative neuralgia was 4/62 (6.5%) and 7/82 (8.5%) in the slit mesh and non-slit mesh groups, respectively (P = 0.76). Satisfaction rates in the slit mesh and non-slit mesh groups were similar at 60/62 (96.8%) and 80/82 (97.6%), respectively (P = 1.00). CONCLUSION No significant differences in outcomes were found between slit and non-slit mesh placement. Both have low complication rates, low recurrence rates, and high satisfaction levels.

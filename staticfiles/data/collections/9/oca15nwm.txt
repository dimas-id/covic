Adoption of robotic technology in urology has been widely popularized as it provides considerable advantages over standard techniques, including improved instrument dexterity, three-dimensional high-definition optics, and enhanced ergonomics. As a result, these features have facilitated the adaptation of robotics for laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) to overcome challenges with clashing, suturing, and intra-abdominal triangulation. Since the inception of robotic LESS by our institution in 2008,(1) many centers have gone on to study this approach in various urologic applications. Herein we discuss the evolution of robotic LESS access, instrumentation, and outcomes with special focus on up-and-coming technology.

Report of the first uniportal wet lab run in South Africa. This included four university centers involving live surgery. Lobectomies as well as other video assisted procedures were performed. The results are the introduction of thorascopic programs in all four centers. The next stage in this program is to extend the outreach to the other centers in the country as well as in the neighboring countries. During 2016 a beginning will be made in Namibia as well as in Botswana.

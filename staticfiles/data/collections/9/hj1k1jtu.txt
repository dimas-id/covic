Abstract A multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) method was developed for simultaneous detection and typing/subtyping of influenza viruses A/H1, A/H3 or B, and respiratory syncytial viruses A or B, followed by DNA semiquantitation using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Such method provides a rapid, specific and sensitive diagnostic tool for detection and semiquantification of respiratory illness specimens.

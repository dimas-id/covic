Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurring during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. This case report describes successful treatment of preterm labor during acute COVID-19 infection. Standard treatment for preterm labor may allow patients with acute COVID-19 infection to recover without the need for preterm delivery. Key Points: Acute COVID-19 infection is associated with a high rate of preterm delivery. Standard treatment for preterm labor such as intravenous magnesium sulfate, antepartum steroid therapy and antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococcus infection were effective in this patient. In the absence of maternal or fetal compromise, acute COVID-19 infection is not an indication for early elective delivery.

The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has rapidly spread throughout the world, accounting for significant morbidity and mortality. There is a concern that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors increase susceptibility to COVID-19. Currently there are no clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse effects of these medications on COVID-19 outcomes. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be continued in patients in otherwise stable conditions who are at risk for or having COVID-19.

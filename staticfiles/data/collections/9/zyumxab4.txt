Abstract Human health and animal health are closely intertwined. We share hundreds of diseases with animals, and they are vectors for many diseases that assail humansâ€”but, at the same time, they are essential to many treatments and cures. We discuss in this chapter various aspects of intimate relationship between human and animal health, giving examples of the importance of multidisciplinary studies in understanding these connections and the fundamental aspects of strategies for promoting the health and well-being of both groups.

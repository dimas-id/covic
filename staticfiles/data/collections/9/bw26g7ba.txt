The purpose of this research is to determine the incidence of income on the satisfaction of quality of life in Latin American capitals. The data was taken from the CAF Survey in 2017 (ECAF), made by Development Bank of Latin America. To do this, an econometric model was constructed which represents the relationship between the studied variables. Among the main findings, it was identified that, except for Mexico City, in all the analyzed cities a deteriorated state of health reduces the probability that the individual feels satisfied with his or her life. Therefore, health is a crucial element to increase the citizensâ€™ perception of the quality of life in Latin American cities.

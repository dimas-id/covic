Based on the analysis of the empirical data for the number of infections in more than 20 countries we propose here a hitherto unknown universal model for the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic that depends not on time, but on the number of infections itself. This change of the independent variable overcomes the crucial issue of analyzing very different countries worldwide within one mathematical framework with similar parameters. This was previously impossible leading to individual description for every country. Our model allows describing the pandemic including its endpoint surprisingly good and giving a figure of merit for the success of the measures to fight the pandemic.

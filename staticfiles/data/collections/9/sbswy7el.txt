The world is currently face to face with a pandemic which is spreading rapidly across the globe caused by SARS-CoV-2, a strain of Coronaviruses (CoVs) belonging to subgenus Sarbecovirus of genus Betacoronavirus. World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 Feb 20 named this disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Covid-19. This pandemic is spreading rapidly and more than 20,00,000 cases have occurred globally. The human Coronaviruses discovered in 1960s were considered potentially harmless endemic viruses with seasonal distribution before late 2002. The CoVs are found in a large number of domestic and wild animals and birds. The first pandemic caused by Coronavirus caused by SARS-CoV was recognized in the late 2002 in Guangdong Province and resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality. This was followed by MERS-CoV which began in 2012 in the Arabian peninsula with multiple outbreaks related to it in various parts of the globe. Various studies have suggested how these viruses made their entry from their natural reservoir bats via intermediate host like civets and camels in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively. The intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 still needs to be established. The SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% similarity to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related-Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV RaTG13). SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be more distant in relation to SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%). At the whole genome sequence level pangolin CoV and SARSr-CoV RaTG13 show 91.02% and 96.2% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 but the S1 subunit of spike protein of pangolin CoV is more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than SARSr-CoV RaTG13. The genetic analysis of the currently circulating strains of the pandemic have shown 99.98-100% similarity in their genomes implying a recent shift to humans. The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be identified to implement control measures in the present pandemic. Also, how the virus moves interspecies will help predict and prevent future pandemics.

The advent of trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) has facilitated removal of tumors previously deemed unresectable, by providing access to the deep structures of the head and neck. Despite this, the wider dissemination of TORS has been restricted due to issues with line of access, as the da Vinci robot was never designed with head and neck surgery in mind. Flexible instruments and novel energy delivery devices offer great potential in overcoming some of the existing challenges surrounding TORS. This review aimed to summarize the existing literature surrounding energy delivery in TORS and highlight areas of future innovation. MEDLINE was searched for studies relating to energy delivery in TORS in November 2019. The existing literature surrounding monopolar and bipolar electrocautery, LASER (CO2, Tm:YAG and blue LASER), Ligasure and Harmonic was reviewed. Additionally, the latest iteration of the da Vinci; the SP, and the FLEX robot were evaluated as novel methods of energy delivery in TORS. Overall, these novel energy devices and robotic systems are predicted to further improve energy delivery to the head and neck. The use of flexible LASER in particular is well substantiated in the literature. This has the potential to achieve treatment de-escalation, based on the excellent outcomes demonstrated for disease-free margins and post-operative morbidity.

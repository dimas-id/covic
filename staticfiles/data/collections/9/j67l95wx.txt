Recent epidemiological reports on Chinese population affected by novel coronavirus showed a wide spread of clinical and biochemical alterations, suggesting a relationship between progression of lung damage to acute respiratory distress syndrome and the systemic inflammatory response, triggering an irreversible multiple organ damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation Bedside ultrasound assessment provides integrated information, describing a multisystemic and dynamic clinical scenario for every patient Furthermore, this approach allows to concentrate multiple information in the hands of a single operator, also limiting the risk of exposure to infection for healthcare professionals As per our experience, herewith reported, we described the characteristics of 10 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection Ultrasound findings were related to clinical information, blood test analysis, and results of instrumental tests, such as chest X-ray and chest computed tomography According to our ultrasound data, COVID-19 appears to be a systemic pathology even in those cases of mild to moderate disease By this multisystem ultrasound approach, we could immediately recognize patients with a diffuse organ involvement and a more severe clinical pattern;moreover, we can protect healthcare workers and limit infection within health facilities

An attempt was made to understand the gap between health and social vulnerability to Covid-19 pandemic. By using multistage sampling technique, 150 samples were collected during February and March 2020. Data highlight that households are highly exposed to novel Covid-19 and also equally sensitive to inadequate and poor availability and accessibility of clean water, sanitation and health care system. Data suggest a grass root awareness programme (ex-ante preventive measures) in the regional languages; increase public health budget to meet the demand and improve the supply chain; establishment of more physical and human infrastructure in long run; comprehensive plan to ensure continuous water supply in the rural areas.

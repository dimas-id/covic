Acute lung injury (ALI) is a leading cause of death in people infected with H5N1 avian influenza virus or the SARS-coronavirus. Imai et al. (2008) now report that ALI is triggered by the signaling of oxidized phospholipids through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the adaptor protein TRIF. These findings provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of ALI, a condition for which treatment options are currently very limited.

In China the protective effect of seasonal influenza vaccine has only been assessed in controlled clinical trials and proven to be highly effective. However, the post-licensure effectiveness of influenza vaccine has not been examined. In our study all influenza cases from the 19 surveillance sites in Guangzhou were laboratory confirmed during 2009 and 2010. Controls were randomly selected from children aged 6 to 59 months in the Children's Expanded Programmed Immunization Administrative Computerized System. 2529 cases and 4539 controls were finally enrolled. After adjusting for gender, age and area of residence, the vaccine effectiveness of full vaccination was 51.79% and 57.78% in the 2009 and 2010 influenza season, respectively. Partial vaccination provided 39.38% and 35.98% protection to children aged 24 to 59 months in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and no protective effect was observed among younger children. Full vaccination is highly protective and partial vaccination is protective for older children. Influenza vaccination in general should be encouraged, and full vaccination should be particularly encouraged because its protective effect is much stronger than that of partial vaccination.

Between March 26 and April 6, among 80 patients who underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT in our department (Brescia, Italy), 4 showed the presence of an interstitial pneumonia suspected for COVID-19 with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmation. All patients except one had bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in at least 2 pulmonary lobes. Inferior lobes and basal segments were the most frequent site of disease. All lung lesions had an increased FDG uptake corresponding to the interstitial pneumonia, and in one case, mediastinal nodal involvement was registered.

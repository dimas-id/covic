This paper reviews current scientific information about the duration of immunity induced in dogs by infection or vaccination. It describes the shortcomings of the methods used to measure the immune responses of dogs, and explains the need for basic studies on the nature of protective humoral and cellular responses, and standardised assays for the long-term duration of immunity to pathogens other than rabies. The information is inadequate to warrant uniform recommendations on the ideal intervals for vaccination; each vaccine must be evaluated on the basis of its own merits and the characteristics of the disease it is intended to guard against.

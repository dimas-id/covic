PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in anxiety and depression between adolescents with myopia and those with normal vision and to examine the relationship between the level of anxiety and depression and the degree of myopia. METHODS A total of 1,103 first-year high school students aged 14-17 years were included in the study. The study group comprised 916 persons with myopia, while the control group comprised 187 persons without refractive error. Volunteers underwent routine eye examinations and completed a set of questionnaires about anxiety and depression. Then, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were compared between groups, and the relationships between anxiety and the degree of myopia and between depression and the degree of myopia were analyzed. RESULTS There was a significant difference in anxiety rate between the students with normal vision and those with myopia. The SAS scores among students with mild, moderate, and severe myopia were also significantly different. However, compared with the students with normal vision, the rate of depression was not significantly increased in the students with myopia, except in cases of severe myopia. Additionally, the SAS scores correlated closely with the diopters of the participants' glasses (r = 0.43, p = .045), while the relationship between SDS scores and the diopters of glasses was not significant (r = 0.19, p = .325). CONCLUSION There was a correlation between myopia and mental health in adolescent students, especially in terms of anxiety.

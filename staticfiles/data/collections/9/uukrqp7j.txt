In order to show that the newly developed K-string composition distance method, based on counting oligopeptide frequencies, for inferring phylogenetic relations of prokaryotes works equally well without requiring the whole proteome data, we used all ribosomal proteins and the set of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases for each species. The latter group has been known to yield inconsistent trees if used individually. Our trees are obtained without making any sequence alignment. Altogether 16 Archaea, 105 Bacteria and 2 Eucarya are represented on the tree. Most of the lower branchings agree well with the latest, 2003, Outline of the second edition of the Bergeyâ€™s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology and the trees also suggest some relationships among higher taxa.

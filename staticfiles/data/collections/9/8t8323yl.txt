Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteric coronavirus. Bioinformatics predicts that PDCoV encodes two accessory proteins (NS6 and NS7), the species-specific proteins for coronavirus. In this study, four mAbs against the predicted NS7 were prepared by using the purified recombinant NS7 protein. Indirect immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that all mAbs recognized cells transfected with an NS7 expression construct or infected with PDCoV. Western blot showed that NS7-specific mAbs recognized an additional protein band of about 12 kDa from PDCoV-infected cell lysates but not from cells with the ectopic expression of NS7. Detailed analysis suggested that this additional protein band represented a novel accessory protein, termed NS7a, a 100 amino acid polypeptide identical to the 3â€² end of NS7. Moreover, NS7a is encoded by a separate subgenomic mRNA with a non-canonical transcription regulatory sequence. In summary, our results identified a third accessory protein encoded by PDCoV, which will enhance our understanding of PDCoV.

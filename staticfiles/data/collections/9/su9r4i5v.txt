INTRODUCTION Perioperative anesthetic management in cases of severe airway obstruction with positional symptoms can be associated with difficulties in ventilation or intubation, with a risk of acute respiratory decompensation at every stage of anesthesia. PATIENT CONCERNS Here we describe the anesthetic management of a 67-year-old man with a massive intrathoracic goiter causing severe tracheal obstruction with positional symptoms. The patient presented with progressive dyspnea that was aggravated in the supine position and was scheduled for total thyroidectomy. DIAGNOSIS Preoperative computed tomography showed a large goiter extending into the thoracic cavity, with diffuse segmental tracheal narrowing for 6 cm. The diameter at the narrowest portion of the trachea was 4.29 mm. INTERVENTIONS Before the induction of general anesthesia, we applied extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in preparation for potential difficulties in securing the airway during general anesthesia. Subsequently, anesthesia was successfully induced and maintained. OUTCOMES After the surgical procedure, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and chest radiography showed resolution of the tracheal narrowing. ECMO was weaned 2 hours after the surgery, and the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day. He was discharged without any complication. CONCLUSION The findings from this case suggest that the use of ECMO before the induction of general anesthesia is a safe method for maintaining oxygenation in patients with severe tracheal obstruction.

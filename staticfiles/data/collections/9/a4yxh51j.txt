Summary Background During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, many patients avoided hospital visit because of fear of infection. Antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal is a risk factor for seizure recurrence. Therefore, seizure control during the SARS outbreak is a good model for examining the impact of drug withdrawal in seizure control. Methods All seizures experienced by each patient before, during, and after the SARS outbreak periods were registered in each patient's seizure diary. The patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of drug withdrawal as well as seizure attack. In each group, seizures occurring during three different periods were compared. Risk factors for seizure recurrence were also examined. Results Of 227 cases, 49 stopped taking medication during the outbreak. Among them, 28 suffered seizure attacks during AED withdrawal. Four cases developed cluster attacks and two cases had status epilepticus after AED withdrawal. AED withdrawal produced a significant increase in seizure frequency. The major risk factors for withdrawal seizures were symptomatic etiologies, polytherapy and non-seizure free before AED withdrawal. Conclusions The SARS outbreak adversely affected seizure control because of AED withdrawal. Patients with polytherapy, non-seizure free and symptomatic etiologies were more susceptible to recurrence of seizures after AED withdrawal.

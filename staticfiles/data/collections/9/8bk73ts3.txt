This study evaluated the feasibility and safety of robotic single port hysterectomy and laparoscopic single port hysterectomy, and to compare the perioperative parameters of the two systems. Twenty patients underwent robotic single port hysterectomy and 25 patients underwent laparoscopic single port hysterectomy. All hysterectomies were successfully performed via a single port and there were no conversions to conventional multi-port laparoscopy, multi-port robotic, open surgery, or vaginal surgery. The median operative time and hysterectomy time in robotic and laparoscopic groups were 90 vs. 90 min (P 0.74), 57.5 vs. 60 min (P 0.17), respectively. The median estimated blood loss was 40 ml in the robotic group and 50 ml in the laparoscopic group (P 0.77). No operative and post-operative complications were observed in the two groups. The median time to discharge from the hospital was one day for both techniques (P 0.17). Robotic and laparoscopic single port systems are feasible and safe for hysterectomy operation in terms of operative time, conversion to laparotomy or multiport laparoscopy/robotic rates, complication rates, and postoperative results in the hands of experienced surgeons. The possible benefits of robotic single port surgery compared with conventional laparoscopy should be evaluated in further randomized controlled studies.

The Macintosh laryngoscope has been described as 'the most numerously and widely made durable item in the history of anesthesia' (Sir Anthony Jephcott, February 6, 1983). This laryngoscope was originally designed to facilitate intubation in unparalyzed patients and became universally adopted by the anesthetic community. In spite of enormous subsequent changes in anesthetic practice, the Macintosh laryngoscope continues to dominate 50 years after its key indication has become obsolete. This study explores the development and success of this ubiquitous instrument.

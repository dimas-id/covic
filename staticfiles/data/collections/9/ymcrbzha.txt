BACKGROUND: Split liver transplantation is still discussed controversially. Utilization of split liver grafts has been declining since a change of allocation rules for the second graft abolished incentives for German centres to perform ex situ splits. We therefore analysed our long-term experiences with the first ex situ split liver transplant series worldwide. METHODS: A total of 131 consecutive adult ex situ split liver transplants (01.12.1987â€“31.12.2010) were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality rates and 1- and 3-year patient survival rates were 13, 76.3, and 66.4 %, respectively. One- and three-year graft survival rates were 63.4 and 54.2 %, respectively. The observed 10-year survival rate was 40.6 %. Continuous improvement of survival from era 1 to 3 was observed (each era: 8 years), indicating a learning curve over 24 years of experience. Patient and graft survival were not influenced by different combinations of transplanted segments or types of biliary reconstruction (p > 0.05; Cox regression). Patients transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis had better survival (p = 0.021; log-rank), whereas all other indications including acute liver failure (13.6 %), acute and chronic graft failure (9.1 %) had no significant influence on survival (p > 0.05; log-rank). Biliary complications (27.4 %) had no significant influence on patient or graft survival (p > 0.05; log-rank). Hepatic artery thrombosis (13.2 %) had a significant influence on graft survival but not on patient survival (p = 0.002, >0.05, respectively; log-rank). CONCLUSIONS: Split liver transplantation can be used safely and appears to be an underutilized resource that may benefit from liberal allocation of the second graft.

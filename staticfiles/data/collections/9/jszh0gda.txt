Nowadays, the application of typical game elements in non-ludic environments has been extended. Gamification has become a very interesting resource to promote engagement and participation in a wide variety of areas including education. For this reason, researchers are increasingly interested in the study of gamification. There are many papers related to the impact that this methodology has on the student’s motivation, engagement or satisfaction. The aim of this paper is to analyze four aspects: “Pressure/tension”, “Perceived choice”, “Perceived competence” and “Effort/importance”. The first part of the study analyzes the aspects at two weeks between a test group and a control group. The second part is even more novel, because it analyzes the aspects when the test group is no longer gamified. Most studies focus on what happens when gamifying, but not when a group of students stops gamifying. The results obtained will serve to advance a part of the knowledge about gamification.

INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Different techniques of mesh placement for cystocele repair are known. Our goal was to compare anatomical and functional outcomes of three different techniques of mesh placement over a 3-year follow-up. METHODS Between March 2003 and June 2004, 230 patients (stage 2-4 pelvic organ prolapse (POP)) were included in a prospective study. For cystocele repair, mesh was implanted either with two arms into the retropubic space (RP) or with two to four arms into the obturator foramen (TO), or fixed to the arcus tendineous fascia pelvis (FG). RESULTS Patients' distribution is as follows: 142 TO, 32 RP, and 31 FG. Anatomical success (cystocele < stage 2 in the POP staging system) was clearly poorer after the retropubic free technique, with success rates of 69% (RP), 90.1% (TO), and 96.6% (FG) (p = 0.004). POP distress inventory (p < 0.005) and POP impact questionnaire scores were both significantly poorer after RP. CONCLUSIONS RP technique is less effective than TO and FG techniques.

Although there is no reported genetic predisposition in contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the mortality rate varies among different ethnic groups. Here we determined potential correlation between COVID-19 and spice consumption. The data from 163 countries including total cases, total deaths, and total recovered were analyzed. It was observed that there is a clear interrelated prevalence between the total number of COVID-19 cases per million population tested and the gram of spice supply per capita per day. Nations with lower consumptions of spices per capita showed greater number of COVID-19 cases per million population. This is not surprising as herbs and spices are well-known to boost immunity. Although the precise molecular mechanisms associated with spices and immunity are not completely understood, our findings led us to hypothesize that spice consumption plays a role in our ability to fight COVID-19; however, intensive research is needed to determine the translational value of these findings.

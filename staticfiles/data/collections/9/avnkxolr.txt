Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, important elective procedures, such as screening colonoscopy, have been delayed or cancelled, and there may be a very long waitlist for rescheduling once the moratorium is lifted. However, DNA-based stool sample tests may be useful for colorectal cancer screening when colonoscopy is not available. The aim of this review is to demonstrate the potential utility of enhanced DNA-based stool testing for colorectal cancer screening and diagnosis during crises that strain available healthcare resources, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review shows that DNA-based stool sample tests have the potential to enable colorectal cancer screening to prioritize patients to elective colonoscopy procedures, the continued delay of which during the COVID-19 pandemic has already placed a burden on future elective procedures.

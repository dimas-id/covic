Researchers predict that the negative effects of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will continue to increase. These negative effects are not solely limited to psycho-pathological problems. Serious physiological, social, and economical difficulties due to COVID-19 have already been observed in various nations. In this study, we suggest a new type of specific phobia, which may be categorized under DSM-V 300.29. The current study developed a self-report instrument whose items address the specific phobia diagnosis criteria of the DSM-V and tested its initial psychometric properties. Results show that the scale has initial evidence of construct, convergent, and discriminant validity, and internal consistency reliability. It should be further tested; however, the COVID-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S) items provide support for assessing the levels of phobia reactions among a wide range of age groups.

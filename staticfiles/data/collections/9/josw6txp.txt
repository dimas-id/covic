The COVID-19 epidemic required rapid and frequent adaptations from the prehospital emergency medical services (EMS). The exposure of EMS providers is significant, particularly during procedures at risk of aerosolization such as advanced airways management or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. EMS personal need to be equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment and trained in its use. Interhospital transfers from COVID-19 patients are complex and involve mainly intubated patients. The possible shortage of resources may motivate the implementation of dedicated pre-hospital triage and orientation recommendations, which should be consistent with the hospital processes.

A 13-year-old boy is described who developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), biochemical pancreatitis and skin vasculitis after an acute respiratory infection due toMycoplasma pneumoniae. The boy was mechanically ventilated for 17 days, but could be discharged in good clinical condition after 36 days of hospitalization. However, major disturbances of the lung function tests persisted, suggesting interstitial fibrosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of ARDS afterM. pneumoniae infection in childhood.

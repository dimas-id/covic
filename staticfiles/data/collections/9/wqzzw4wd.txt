Prolonged prone position ventilation reduces the 30-day mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and probably in COVID-19 infection, too. Although the respiratory illness is the most important clinical manifestation of COVID-19, a large number of patients with COVID-19 suffer from new onset cardiac dysfunction where ECG and ECG monitoring play a critical role. However, the effects of prone position on the ECG is unknown. A healthy, 30-year-old man is presented with the change of ECG mimicking old myocardial infarction in the V1-3 leads after prone position. This could help us to recognize the true pathologic ECG signs in this situation. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(26): 1103-1104.

BACKGROUND Dumping syndrome is a well-known side effect of laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB), and it is commonly believed that dumping syndrome is less likely to occur after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), due to the preservation of the pyloric sphincter. However, it is not uncommon for patients undergoing LSG at our center to report symptoms suggestive of dumping syndrome. OBJECTIVE To assess the prevalence of symptoms of dumping syndrome after LSG compared with LRYGB. SETTING A single surgical group at a high-volume (700 cases per year) Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery Center of Excellence. METHODS One thousand four hundred seventy-one LRYGB (366) and LSG (1105) patients received a questionnaire to assess symptoms of dumping syndrome, utilizing a modified version of the Sigstad scoring system. Dumping syndrome was considered to be present when the questionnaire score exceeded a threshold value. RESULTS A total of 360 responses were received (249 LSG, 111 LRYGB). 26.5% (66) LSG and 41.4% (46) LRYGB exceeded the threshold for dumping syndrome (p < 0.01). 84.8% (56) LSG and 84.7% (39) LRYGB reported early dumping syndrome (p > 0.05). Thirty-six percent (24) LSG and 28% (13) LRYGB reported late dumping syndrome (p > 0.05). Twenty-seven percent (62) LSG and 44.4% (44) LRYGB reported at least one symptom of dumping syndrome with sweets (p < 0.05). 34.3% (85) LSG and 35.5% (39) LRYGB reported symptoms when drinking with or within 30 min of a meal (p > 0.05). 14.5% (36) LSG and 17.3% (19) LRYGB reported symptoms after alcohol consumption (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Dumping syndrome after LSG is prevalent but has not been widely reported. This finding may impact clinicians and patients in their choice of procedure and has relevance in post-operative education and care.

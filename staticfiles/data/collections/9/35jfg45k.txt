Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by macrophage and neutrophil leukocyte recruitment and activation in the liver. Damage‐ and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns contribute to a self‐perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM‐1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐mimicking complexes GF9‐HDL and GA/E31‐HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5‐week alcohol feeding with the Lieber‐DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM‐1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol‐fed mice, and TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM‐1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol‐induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM‐1 signaling. The TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly inhibited macrophage (epidermal growth factor‐like module‐containing mucin‐like hormone receptor‐like 1 [F4/80], clusters of differentiation [CD]68) and neutrophil (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) markers and proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP‐1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α], interleukin‐1β [IL‐1β], macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP‐1α]) at the mRNA level compared to the HDL vehicle. Administration of TREM‐1 inhibitors ameliorated liver steatosis and early fibrosis markers (α‐smooth muscle actin [αSMA] and procollagen1α [Pro‐Col1α]) at the mRNA level in alcohol‐fed mice. However, the HDL vehicle also reduced serum ALT and some cytokine protein levels in alcohol‐fed mice, indicating HDL‐related effects. Conclusion: HDL‐delivered novel TREM‐1 peptide inhibitors ameliorate early phases of inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and activation in the liver and attenuate hepatocyte damage and liver steatosis. TREM‐1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for further investigations in ALD.

COVID-19 is frequently associated with severe systemic consequences, including vasculitis, a hyperinflammatory state and hypercoagulation. The mechanisms leading to these life-threatening abnormalities are multifactorial. Based on the analysis of publicly available interactomes, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly causes a deficiency in C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), a pathogen-specific mechanism that may help explain significant systemic abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

This article advocates for a universal approach to infection control measures in cystic fibrosis. The central tenets of infection control include hand hygiene, contact precautions, regular microbiological surveillance and adopting inpatient, outpatient, domestic and social practices to minimise acquisition of common CF pathogens. Infection control measures should be proactive and prospective, assuming all patients harbour aggressive pathogens, and not relying on past culture results. The challenges of implementing these policies include cost, equipment, education, consistency, meticulousness all whilst balancing additional procedures to a busy clinical workload.

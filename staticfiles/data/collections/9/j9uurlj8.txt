A retained microcatheter is a rare complication of endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. We describe such a case that was complicated by delayed microcatheter fracture within the internal carotid artery and subsequent thrombo-embolism resulting in transient ischaemic attacks. We also describe endovascular management of this complication through the use of several carotid stents.

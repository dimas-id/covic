The execution of an event in a complex and distributed system where the dependencies vary during the evolution of the system can be represented in many ways, and one of them is to use Context-Dependent Event structures. Many kinds of event structures are related to various kind of Petri nets. The aim of this paper is to find the appropriate kind of Petri net that can be used to give an operational flavour to the dependencies represented in a Context/Dependent Event structure.

Using longitudinal plasma samples from thirty COVID-19 patients, we observed that virus-specific antibodies are detectable in 100% of patients two weeks after symptom onset. We also show that these patients produced variable levels of neutralizing antibodies which reached a plateau two weeks after symptom onset and then declined in the majority of patients. Furthermore, we report that neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in 56% (14/25) of asymptomatic carriers.

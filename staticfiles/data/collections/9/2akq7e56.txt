In this work we are studying the sentiment in Open Source Software projects and more specifically in the process of bug reporting, to investigate the human factor, namely, the feedback from the community (end-users, developers, testers, etc.). One of the characteristics for which Open Source Software has gained attention, over the years, is the fact that it is continuously being tested and maintained by its community of volunteers. Sentiment analysis, a rapidly growing field, can enrich software evaluation with a social aspect. Results suggest that FLOSS projectsâ€™ bug reports can potentially constitute a rich emotionally - imbued information source.

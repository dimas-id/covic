Significant misinformation about COVID-19 has been spread on the internet. Parents of children with complex aerodigestive problems have a hard time understanding the information they encounter on the internet and the news media and interpreting how it relates to their child's complex needs. Our multidisciplinary team, at the suggestion of a parent, hosted 3 virtual "town halls" in which families could ask questions directly of pediatric otolaryngology, pediatric pulmonology and case management in order to efficiently obtain factual evidence-based up-to-date advice. The information discussed at the town halls was then annotated and disseminated via active, parent-run aerodigestive social media forums. The information disseminated via the town halls reached 4787 Facebook participants.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow diverters are increasingly used to treat a broad category of cerebral aneurysms. We conducted an in vitro study to angiographically compare the flow diversion effect of Surpass Evolve from Stryker Neurovascular with the Pipeline Shield Embolization Device from Medtronic Neurovascular. METHODS Three copies each of three carotid aneurysm geometries were manufactured from silicone. Evolve and Pipeline flow diverters were deployed in one copy of each geometry; the third copy was used as Control. High-speed angiography was acquired under pulsatile flow in each replica, contrast concentration-time curves within the aneurysms were recorded, and the curves were quantified with six parameters. The parameters were statistically evaluated to compare the flow diversion effect of both devices. RESULTS The Evolve showed greater flow diversion trends in almost all intra-geometry comparisons than the Pipeline. When aggregated over the three geometries, the Evolve was statistically significantly better than the Pipeline in four of the six parameters, and about the same or better (not statistically significant) than the Pipeline in the other two parameters. CONCLUSIONS The Evolve device demonstrated greater in vitro flow diversion effects than Pipeline. Comparative efficacy of the devices will need to be adjudicated based on clinical outcomes.

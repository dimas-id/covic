Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the standard treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis in patients with situs inversus totalis (SIT). In an effort to reduce morbidity and improve the cosmesis single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy has recently emerged, where the surgery is done through a single port, typically the patient's navel. This improves the cosmesis, lessens post-operative pain and ensures virtually a "scar less" surgery. We report a case of successful single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy for a patient with SIT, and describe its technical advantages and review of literature.

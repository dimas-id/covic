BACKGROUND Laparoscopy has gradually become the gold standard for the treatment of non-palpable testicles (NPT), with different success and complication rates. OBJECTIVES To evaluate outcomes of the one-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy for NPT in our department. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the medical files of patients who underwent laparoscopic orchidopexy with the identical technique. Only patients with at least one year follow-up were included. At follow-up we assessed the age (at surgery), follow-up time, laterality of testes, postoperative complications, testicular size and testicular localization. RESULTS Thirty-six consecutive patients, median age 16 months, underwent one-stage laparoscopic orchiopexy. Sixteen patients (44.4%) had peeping testis type, in 13 patients (36.1%) the testicle was located within 2 cm from the internal ring and in the remaining 7 patients (19.4%) it was detected > 2 cm from the internal ring. In six children (16.7%) dividing the spermatic vessels was performed in one stage with laparoscopic orchiopexy. In the remaining 30 patients (83.7%) a laparoscopic one-stage procedure was performed with preservation of the spermatic vessels. Testicular atrophy was observed in 2 cases (5.6%), and 6 patients (16%) had a relatively small testicle compared to the contralateral normal testicle at follow-up. Two patients (5.6%) presented with testicle positioning at the entrance area into the scrotum. None of the patients demonstrated hernia recurrence at follow-up. There was no difference in surgical outcome in children who had surgery with preservation of the spermatic vessels versus those who underwent orchiopexy with division of the spermatic vessels in one stage. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transection of the testicular vessels appeared to be safe in boys with high abdominal testes that did not reach the scrotum after laparoscopic high retroperitoneal dissection.

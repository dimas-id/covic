Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has two inconsistent phenomena: its reproduction number is almost two; and it shows earlier and lower peaks for new cases and the total number of patients. Object: To resolve this difficulty, we constructed a mathematical model that can explain these phenomena. Method: We applied a susceptible-infected-model with the proportion of asymptomatic patients among the infected (q) as a key parameter for estimation as well as the basic reproduction number (R0). Results: We observed the first outbreak peak in Japan on April 3 for those infected on March 29 .Their R0 and q were estimated respectively as 2.048 and 99.987%. Discussion and Conclusion: By introducing a very high proportion of asymptomatic cases, two inconsistent phenomena might be resolved. This hypothesis should be verified through additional study.

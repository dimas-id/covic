COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Starting from Wuhan (China) where it was firstly reported, it rapidly spread to the rest of the world, causing a pandemic with more than 300,000 deaths to date. We report an extremely severe case of coronavirus pneumonia in an over 80-year-old patient with hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Despite a clearly poor anamnestic and clinical prognostic forecast, she was successfully discharged thanks to a careful evaluation of the case and of the complications that have arisen. Although a higher vulnerability of geriatric patients has been observed, the literature on elderly COVID-19 patients has remained very scarce, especially in those over 80. The article aims to explore factors that may allow the successful outcome and provides important elements to better understand this disease.

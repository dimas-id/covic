Infectious Bronchitis virus (IBV) genotype Q1 was detected for the first time in China in 1996, and then spread worldwide. The first report of Q1 genotype in Italy occurred in 2011 and a deep molecular investigation of a Q1 isolated in Italy in 2013 has led to speculation regarding the origin of this genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 sequence of a Q1 Italian strain revealed a close relationship with sequences of the 624I strains circulating in Italy in the early 1990s and this led to the idea that 624I was an ancestor of the Q1 genotype. Despite the fact that most heterogeneity of IBVs occurs in the S1 gene, the sequence analysis of this gene alone was not sufficient to confirm or deny this hypothesis. In the present study, an Italian 624I (gammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/IP14425/96) was fully sequenced for the first time and compared to all available complete Q1 genome sequences. This analysis confirmed the genetic correlation between GammaCoV/AvCov/Ck/Italy/IP14425/96 and Q1 strains, suggesting a common origin between 624I and Q1 genotypes.

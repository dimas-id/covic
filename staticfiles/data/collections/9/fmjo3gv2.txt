Interactions between swine influenza virus and swine alveolar macrophages were studied in vitro. Cell lysis occurred 24 h post-infection and was shown by a decreased neutral red uptake. UV inactivation of the influenza virus, or the addition of anti-influenza antibodies suppressed the virus-induced macrophage lysis. Inversely, pretreatment of swine alveolar macrophages by a phagocytosis inhibitor, namely cytochalasin B, increased the cell susceptibility to virus-induced lysis. The present in vitro studies support the hypothesis that defects in pulmonary antibacterial mechanisms associated with influenza infections are partly due to a direct toxic effect of the virus on alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, the studies show that virus-induced macrophage lysis is influenced by specific humoral immune responses and by modifications in microfilament cell functions.

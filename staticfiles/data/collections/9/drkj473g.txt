Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus infection was diagnosed in neonatal calves with enteritis. Successful diagnostic procedures included direct immunofluorescence of frozen tissue sections, histopathology, and virus isolation. Virus isolation from buffy coats and serum was successful in detecting infected animals, whereas direct immunofluorescence of buffy coat samples was found to be less reliable. Virus was not isolated from any fecal samples. Booster vaccinations and the culling of animals shedding virus resulted in improved calf viability in this herd. It is suggested that procedures for the diagnosis of BVD virus infection should always be included in the diagnosis of neonatal calf enteritis.

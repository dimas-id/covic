PURPOSE An incisional hernia may occur through the incision area following a surgical operation, through the trocar opening and even through drainage exit points. Various synthetic surgical meshes have recently been used for the surgical repair of incisional hernias. In this study, we analysed the burst strength forces of heavyweight mesh and lightweight mesh in an incisional animal model. METHODS Following experimental formation of incisional hernias in 32 Wistar albino rats, they were divided into four groups. Polypropylene suture was used for closure of the abdominal incision in Group 1. In Groups 2, 3 and 4, polyester, polypropylene + polyglactin and polypropylene meshes, respectively, were fixed on the surface of the fascia after closing the defects in the rats. Polypropylene and polyester meshes are classified as heavy mesh. Light mesh is composed of a non-absorbable part (polypropylene) and an absorbable part (polyglactin), which will disappear 80 days after implantation. The rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment. The pullout force of the fascia and meshes were recorded by use of a digital tension meter. RESULTS The mean pullout forces for Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 were found to be 123.4 +/- 13.3, 292.33 +/- 17.4, 281.66 +/- 16.3 and 310.60 +/- 26.1 N, respectively. CONCLUSION At the end of the experiment, the polypropylene (25 g/cm(2)) present in the lightweight mesh was found to lose only a small percentage of the burst strength compared to the polypropylene (85 g/cm(2)) present in the heavyweight mesh.

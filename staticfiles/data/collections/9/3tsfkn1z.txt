Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a highly virulent positive-sense single stranded RNA virus that spreads rapidly via respiratory droplets, causing severe acute respiratory syndromes with significant mortality and morbidity. Currently 210 countries and territories are affected around the world with a reported 2.6 million confirmed cases. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has changed the way patients attend their specialist appointments and receive medical care. While some specialist clinics have closed we have implemented strategies and restructured our academic practice in Australia to minimize the spread of disease while treating patients who need urgent care. We hope to share these strategies in the hope they may be useful to the dermatology community.

The aim of this study was to determine the radiologic findings associated with admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with pH1N1 infection. One hundred and four patients (15â€“96 years) with laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection seen at the Emergency Department from July to December 2009 who underwent chest radiographs were studied. Radiographs were evaluated for consolidation, ground-glass opacities, interstitial patterns, distribution, and extent of findings. Eighty-seven (83.7%) of the patients were managed in the ward, and 17 (16.3%) patients eventually required admission to the ICU. All patients admitted to the ICU showed abnormalities on the initial radiograph. The presence of consolidation, multifocal, diffuse, and bilateral involvement on the initial radiograph was associated with a statistically higher risk of requiring ICU admission (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences regarding age, sex, and presence of underlying comorbidities. Evolution to ARDS was found in eight cases that necessitated ICU care. All of them had on the initial radiograph patchy multifocal consolidations (p < 0.001) with bilateral lesions in six cases. A higher number of lung zones involved and consolidation on the initial chest radiograph as well as a rapid progression of the radiological abnormalities were identified in patients requiring ICU admission and development of ARDS. Initial chest radiographs show acute abnormalities in all patients with severe disease. The findings of a multifocal patchy consolidation pattern with bilateral or diffuse lung involvement on admission should alert of the impending severity of disease and the risk of necessitating ICU admission

BACKGROUND Recent authors have pioneered the use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for umbilical cholecystectomy. The SILS approach has the potential of reducing the trauma of the surgical access and postoperative pain. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) greatly reduces patient postoperative pain compared with traditional thoracotomy incisions. The current trend is to use fewer working ports to reduce even more postoperative pain, chest wall paresthesia, and hospital stay. No reports have described using a SILS port in VATS. METHODS From September 2009 to March 2010, 13 patients had surgery for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The patients underwent single-lung ventilation. A 2.5-cm-long incision was made at the sixth intercostal space in the median axillary line. The pleural space was entered by blunt dissection for placement of a single flexible port. A 5-mm 0Â° videothoracoscope, a roticulating grasper, and an endoGIA stapler were introduced through port channels. Apical lung blebs were stapled, and pleurodesis by pleural abrasion with Marlex mesh was performed. RESULTS The study enrolled nine men (69.2%) and four women with a median age of 26.3 years. No complications were recorded. The postoperative pain was mild for 10 patients (76.9%) and moderate for 3 patients. Mild chest wall paresthesia (numbness) was observed in three patients (23.07%). The postoperative hospital stay was 2.15 days. CONCLUSIONS Although the SILS port is for laparoscopic use, it allowed an adequate lineup of the instruments along the intercostal space and adequate instrument maneuverability for stapling and resecting of apical lung bullae or blebs. The procedure was accomplished successfully for 92.3% of the patients. This is the first report on the use of a SILS port in VATS. Further work and development of a proper thoracic single port are needed to define the uses and advantages of this uniportal technique.

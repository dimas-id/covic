The article illustrates the efficacy of proper social distancing methods during disease outbreaks. We inspect the outbreak by counting the number of ways n individuals are infected, given an initially infected patient introduced in a lattice(c(n)). Using self-avoiding walks on lattices where the infection spreads according to the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Removed) model, we were able to show an exponential decay of the ratio of initial and final values of c(n) after the distancing methods were employed.

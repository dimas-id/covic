Background This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomies performed by a training consultant or an experienced consultant. Methods The study included 103 patients (81 males, 22 females; mean age 59.6Â±9.5 years; range, 32 to 84 years) who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy due to non-small cell lung cancer. The training consultant assisted on the same side with the experienced consultant during the operations of the experienced consultant. The experienced consultant observed in the operating room and provided advice from a distance during the first five operations of the training consultant. Comorbidities, postoperative complications, and mortality were evaluated. Results Patients" demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and postoperative complications were similar between the two surgeons (p>0.05). Operative time, incidence of prolonged air leak, and length of hospital stay were higher in procedures performed by the training consultant (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in rates of life-threatening complications or mortality. Conclusion Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy can be performed safely by surgeons in training. Effective training programs may produce outcomes comparable to those of experienced surgeons.

Canine circovirus (CanineCV), a new pathogen, was found to be associated with canine hemorrhagic diarrhea, vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis, and acute gastroenteritis. Although CanineCV was highly positive rate in diarrhea cases, its pathogenicity remains controversial. In this study, the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of CanineCV infection among domestic dogs in northeastern China was investigated by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on recombinant capsid protein. Results revealed the proposed iELISA had no cross-reactivity with other related pathogens, and yielded good diagnostic values. Then, to evaluate the rCap iELISA, this study applied it to detect antibodies against CanineCV in 1,047 clinical serum samples obtained from northeastern China in 2016â€“2017. Results showed the positive rates in the five cities of Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces ranged from 22.22 to 42.29%. Statistical analysis shows a significant difference in age between dogs <3 months old with respect to the >1-year-old dogs (p = 0.005), that is, the CanineCV infection was more frequently identified from older dogs. In the artificially infected experiment, the dogs developed seroconversion after 9 or 12 days and the main way of virus excretion was through feces. More interestingly, among the 32 ELISA-positive serum samples, 34.75% samples tested positive for the CanineCV DNA by qPCR, far higher than that in ELISA-negative serum samples (5.26%, 2/38). This report is the first to demonstrate that CanineCV infection is common in the dog population in northeastern China. The results showed obvious differences in the positive rate associated with diarrhea, age, but not with different cities. This study also provide basis for evaluating the pathogenic potential of CanineCV. But, the pathogenicity, the relationship between antibody level and immune protection, and the harmful effects of this virus remain to be established.

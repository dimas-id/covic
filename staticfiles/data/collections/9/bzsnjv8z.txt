Many risk factors have been proposed in the development of the cerebral aneurysms. Hemodynamics including blood velocity, volume flow rate (VFR), and intravascular pressure are thought to be prognostic indicators of aneurysm development. We hypothesize that treatment of cerebral aneurysm using a flow-diverting stent will bring these hemodynamic parameters closer to those observed on the contralateral side. In the current study, a patient with a giant cerebral aneurysm was studied pre- and postoperatively using phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) to measure the hemodynamic changes resulting from the deployment of a flow-diverting stent. PC-MRI was used to calculate intravascular pressure, which was compared to more invasive endovascular catheter-derived measurements. After stent placement, the measured VFRs in vessels of the treated hemisphere approached those measured on the contralateral side, and flow symmetry changed from a laterality index of -0.153 to 0.116 in the middle cerebral artery. Pressure estimates derived from the PC-MRI velocity data had an average difference of 6.1% as compared to invasive catheter transducer measurements. PC-MRI can measure the hemodynamic parameters with the same accuracy as invasive methods pre- and postoperatively.

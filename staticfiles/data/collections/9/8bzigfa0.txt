The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has necessitated a dramatic shift in how our dermatology residents and fellows are educated. Distance or online learning has become the norm, and several national and international academic societies have combined resources to assure that continuing medical education occurs during this difficult time. The purpose of this communication is to review select online resources available to dermatology trainees and to encourage our colleagues to continue to advance our specialty through distance learning.

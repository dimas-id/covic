Background Coronary artery diseases and autoimmune disorders are common in clinical practice. In this study, a novel method of immune-modulation to modify the endothelial function was studied to modulate the features of the endothelial cells, and thereby to reduce coronary artery disease and other disorders modulated by endothelium. Methods HUVEC cells were seeded in the cell culture, and streptococcus pyogenes were added to the cell culture, and the supernatant was studied for the secreted proteins. In the second phase, the bacterial lysate was synthesized, and the lysate was added to cell culture; and the proteins in the supernatant were studied at various time intervals. Results When streptococcus pyogenes alone was added to culture, E Cadherin, Angiostatin, EpCAM and PDGF-AB were some of the biomarkers elevated significantly. HCC1, IGFBP2 and TIMP were some of the biomarkers which showed a reduction. When the lysate was added, the cell-culture was maintained for a longer time, and it showed the synthesis of immune regulatory cytokines. Heatmap analysis showed a significant number of proteins/cytokines concerning the immune/pathways, and toll-like receptors superfamily were modified. BLC, IL 17, BMP 7, PARC, Contactin2, IL 10 Rb, NAP 2 (CXCL 7), Eotaxin 2 were maximally increased. By principal component analysis, the results observed were significant. Conclusion There is potential for a novel method of immunomodulation of the endothelial cells, which have pleiotropic functions, using streptococcus pyogenes and its lysates.

This study mainly focused on the very serious COVID-19 epidemic situation at present and provided a new insight for the treatment and monitor of patients with COVID-19. Through this meta-analysis, we could draw a conclusion that less expression of blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells count might reflect the severity of infection and often accompanied by a poor prognosis. Hence, we inferred blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells count could be a promising biomarker for disease assessment and monitor of patients with COVID-19.

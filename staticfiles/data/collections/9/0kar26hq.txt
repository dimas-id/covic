Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has become an effective multiple organ support therapy instead of single renal replacement as initially expected, and it is widely used in intensive care unit (ICU). After the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a series of expert recommendation or consensus have been developed to diagnose and treat the disease, including CRRT in acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyper inflammatory response. However, CRRT in COVID-19 is extraordinarily different from regular one due to different pathophysiology and infectious clinical scenarios. Accordingly, the paper aims to elaborate the similarities and differences between CRRT in COVID-19 and routine treatment in terms of safety and accessibility, indications and timing, clinical operation, anticoagulation, fluid management, prevention and control of infectious diseases, etc.

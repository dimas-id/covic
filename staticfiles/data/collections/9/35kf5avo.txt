In April 2020, respiratory disease and increased mortality were observed in farmed mink on two farms in the Netherlands. In both farms, at least one worker had been found positive for SARS-CoV-2. Necropsies of the mink revealed interstitial pneumonia, and organ and swab samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by qPCR. Variations in viral genomes point at between-mink transmission on the farms and lack of infection link between the farms. Inhalable dust in the mink houses contained viral RNA, indicating possible exposure of workers.

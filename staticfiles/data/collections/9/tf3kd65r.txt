Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is expected to affect operations and lifestyles of interventional cardiologists (ICs) around the world in unprecedented ways. Timely gathering of information on this topic can provide valuable insight and improve the handling of the ongoing and future pandemic outbreaks. Methods and Results A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via email, text messaging, WhatsAppTM and social media to ICs between April 6 and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the U.S. (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protection equipment (PPE) was available to 95% of respondents, however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70% and 74% indicated absence of COVID-19 pre-testing. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient, primarily due to fear of viral transmission (88%). While the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%) and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss. Conclusions Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission. There is near universal adoption of PPEs, however COVID-19 pre-testing and access to FIT-tested N95 masks is suboptimal. While there is concern over impending financial loss, substantial engagement in telemedicine and online education is reported.

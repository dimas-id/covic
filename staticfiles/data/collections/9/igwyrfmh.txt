Abstract: Immunoglobulin Y (IgY) is the major antibody in chickens, and is transferred in large quantities to the egg yolk to confer passive immunity to the developing embryo. IgY can easily be harvested from the yolk, and is an ideal alternative to using mammalian IgG antibodies. The following chapter discusses the production and purification of IgY, as well as its many advantages and applications, including the use of IgY as a diagnostic and analytical tool and for passive immunotherapy to treat numerous health conditions.

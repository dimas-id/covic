We describe the process and outcome of our efforts to port a legacy Fortran benchmark code to heterogeneous GPU-accelerated computing architectures using OpenMP. The benchmark code is one of the multi-zone NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB-MZ) called SP-MZ. This “mini-app” mimics the computation and data movement that is found in popular legacy and modern implicit computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers. Our objective was to examine how efficiently legacy Fortran codes can be ported to accelerators by leveraging OpenMP directives. We describe the development and optimization process and demonstrate the performance impact of various code modifications. We show select profiling results from the NVIDIA Visual Profiler (nvpp) to help others diagnose and overcome performance issues in their own applications. We present results for two compute systems endowed with NVIDIA V100 accelerators.

We whole-genome sequenced 55 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Western Germany and investigated the genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the Heinsberg district and Dusseldorf. While the genetic structure of the Heinsberg outbreak indicates a clonal origin, reflective of superspreading dynamics during the carnival season, distinct viral strains are circulating in Dusseldorf, reflecting the city's international links. Limited detection of Heinsberg strains in the Dusseldorf area despite geographical proximity may reflect efficient containment and contact tracing efforts.

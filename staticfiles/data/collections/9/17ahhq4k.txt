We report on a 33-year old Polish truck driver who was admitted as a COVID-19 suspicion case to our hospital after a short stay in northern Italy and was eventually diagnosed with fulminant Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. In retrospect, the patient always had his dog with him in the truck cab and was regularly licked in the face. Following adequate therapy, the patient recovered completely after 8 weeks and was discharged from the hospital in good general condition.

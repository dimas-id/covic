PURPOSE The aim of this study was the compare the midterm outcomes of laparoscopic greater curvature plication (LGCP) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 to 35 kg/m². MATERIALS AND METHODS This single center, retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted for obese patients that underwent LGCP or LSG from March 2013 to February 2016. These two patient groups were compared in terms of demographics, perioperative outcomes, weight loss [percent excess weight loss (%EWL)], comorbidity resolution, and immediate and long-term complications. RESULTS A total of 149 patients were eligible for the study. Seventy-five patients underwent LGCP (group A) and 74 LSG (group B). These two groups were matched for age, gender, and baseline BMI. Three patients in each group were readmitted for complications within 30 days postoperatively. %EWL in groups A and B were 51.1±16.9 and 47.8±20.8 at 3 months (p=0.084), 71.1±20.2 and 74.5±21.8 at 6 months (p=0.165), 77.1±18.4 and 87.8±25.1 at 12 months (p=0.002), 70.5±18.5 and 83.4±28.7 at 24 months (p=0.005), and 67.3±15.3 and 78.6±31.7 at 36 months (p=0.054), respectively. Intergroup differences in resolution rates of metabolic comorbidities between the two groups were not significant. CONCLUSION Although mean weight loss after LGCP was inferior to that after LSG, especially after six months postoperatively, it was acceptable, and LGCP had an excellent metabolic comorbidity resolution rate in patients with BMIs, ranging from 30 to 35 kg/m².

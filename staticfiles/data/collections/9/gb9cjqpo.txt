Hypertension is one of the most important treatable causes of mortality and morbidity in the world, but despite the wide availability of pharamacological therapy, blood pressure is poorly controlled in many patients. Renal sympathetic denervation (RSD) is a novel therapeutic option whereby the renal sympathetic nerves, which lie within and around the wall of the renal arteries, are ablated using a catheter placed within the arterial lumen. The Symplicity HTN-2 trial has shown that RSD reduces blood pressure to a clinically relevant degree; this finding has resulted in an explosion in interest in the procedure and RSD has the potential to become a standard therapy for many hypertensive patients. Many new devices are in development that will simplify the procedure, and several novel indications for RSD are currently being investigated in clinical trials.

The risk of terrorist attacks with weapons of mass destruction like biological agents is increasing. Biological agents can be disseminated as aerosols or by contaminating food and beverages. The multitude of agents and the different pathways of transmission cause very different clinical presentations. Natural infections with potential biological agents in Germany are rare and in most cases imported from endemic areas abroad. It is crucial to include these diseases in the spectrum of differential diagnosis. Local and state health departments have to be notified as early as possible in dubious cases. Public health management can be efficient only, if there is high reporting discipline and all epidemic measures are well coordinated.

In this commentary, we focus our attention on what is known about SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. We report literature and National data. The possible and different explanations for understanding why the infection seems to be more benign and less frequent in children are discussed. The possible role of children in the COVID-19 viral disease pandemic is also commented. Finally, our work suggests to search for future evidence and containment strategies to manage virus spread.

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countries on all continents where containment and isolation measures have been systematically applied. AIM: To synthesize the available evidence on the management of home isolation due to COVID-19 infection. METHOD: A scoping review has been carried out using the Trip Database, PUBMED, CINAHL, COCHRANE and Scopus controlled language without any limits. From all the documents located, information was extracted on the date of publication, country of publication, type of study, assessment of the level of evidence and degree of recommendation, and results of interest to answer the research question. Critical reading of the selected documents has been carried out, but without using it as an exclusion criterion but rather informative. RESULTS: 163 records were located and 14 were selected. The recommendations have been grouped into 10 topics around all the daily management of home care. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of robust evidence on isolation from COVID-19 infection is objective. Most of the documents are reviews carried out after the consensus of experts at the international level.

Viral respiratory tract infections are a major cause of outpatient and hospital admissions among young children. The aim of the study was to describe the incidence and the course of viral respiratory infections in children aged 0-5 years. Material and methods. The total number of 114 children was included into the study. All patients presented influenza-like symptoms and were examined for the presence of 12 viruses. Nosopharyngeal swabs were tested with RT-PCR method for: influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3 virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, adenowirus, RSV A, RSV B virus and two coronaviruses: OC43 and 229E/NL63. Results. The viral etiology of respiratory tract infection was confirmed in 72 children (62%), in 62 (54%) patients the disease was caused by a single etiological agent, while in 9 (8%) patients there were viral coinfections. The most often found viruses were influenza A and B viruses (35 patients, 30%), and RSV infections (27 patients, 24%). Conclusions. Since influenza viruses are the most common etiological agents of respiratory tract infections in young children, it is strongly recommended to increase the influenza vaccine coverage rates among children younger than 5 years, as the vaccination is the most effective tool in the prevention of the disease.Copyright Â© 2016 Medpress.

Ribavirin is an antiviral agent commonly used in Hong Kong for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The choice of oral ribavirin therapeutic products available in the local market is currently limited to capsules. The present study investigated the chemical stability of an oral ribavirin suspension (200 mg/5mL) prepared extemporaneously from oral capsules using a sugar-free suspension formula. The suspension was subjected to stability testing at 4 deg C for up to 28 days. Employing a validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic method, the ribavirin content of the extemporaneous preparation has been demonstrated to exhibit negligible changes throughout the storage period. No degradation product was observable in all high-peroformance liquid chromatograms, suggesting that the suspension remained chermically stable under the stated conditions.

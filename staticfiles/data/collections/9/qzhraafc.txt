The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted operations in academic Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology throughout the U.S. and will continue to impact them for the foreseeable future. It has also created an environment conducive to innovation and the accelerated implementation of new ideas. These departments will need to adapt their operations to accomodate COVID-19 and to continue to meet their tripartite mission of clinical excellence, medical education, and women's health research. This "Call to Action" paper from leaders of AGOS and CUCOG provides a framework to help leaders of Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology re-imagine and re-engineer their operations in light of the current COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.

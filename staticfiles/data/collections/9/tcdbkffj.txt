Metabolic syndrome (MetS)-a diagnostic grouping of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity-has been indicated as a risk factor for perioperative complications following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). This study investigates the impact of MetS on perioperative complications, specifically the importance of controlling MetS components. One hundred thirty-three patients undergoing TJA with all four components of MetS were identified. They were matched one-to-one with patients without MetS. Control of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension was assessed. Thirty-five patients with MetS were found to have at least a single uncontrolled component. The complication rates were 49%, 8%, and 8% for uncontrolled MetS, controlled MetS, and no MetS, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed independent associations between control of MetS components and both perioperative complications and length of stay. Both surgeons and patients should be aware of the substantial risk of dangerous complications following TJA in patients with uncontrolled metabolic syndrome.

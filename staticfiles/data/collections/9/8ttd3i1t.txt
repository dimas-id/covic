Lung hernias are rare and are most commonly secondary to blunt or penetrating trauma. Few cases have been reported after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and only one case after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy. We report a case of lung hernia after video-assisted, thoracoscopic, right upper lobectomy. The hernia was demonstrated by computerized tomography and repaired by minimally invasive techniques. We believe that the combination of removal of a large lung specimen and the presence of emphysema may predispose to lung herniation after thoracoscopic lobectomy. Thoracic surgeons should be aware of this possible complication.

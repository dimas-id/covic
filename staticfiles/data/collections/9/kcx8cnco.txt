Predictions about the further development of the Corona pandemic are widely diverging. Here, a simple yet powerful algorithm is introduced for extrapolating infection rate and number of total infections from available data. The calculation predicts that under present conditions the infection rate in Germany will culminate in a few weeks and decrease to low values by mid-June 2020. Total number of infections will reach several 100,000 though.

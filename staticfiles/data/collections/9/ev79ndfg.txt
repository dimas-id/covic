Objective: This study aimed to summarize the characteristics of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) to provide reliable evidence for further guiding clinical routine. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were thoroughly searched to identified relevant articles involving the features of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with COVID-19. All data were analyzed utilizing R software version i386 4.0.0. Random-effects models were employed to calculate pooled mean differences. Results: 19 trials incorporating 1332 cases were included in the study. The results demonstrated that the incidence of ground-glass opacities (GGO) was 0.79, consolidation was 0.34; mixed GGO and consolidation was 0.46; air bronchogram sign was 0.41; crazy paving pattern was 0.32; interlobular septal thickening was 0.55; reticulation was 0.30; bronchial wall thickening was 0.24; vascular enlargement was 0.74. subpleural linear opacity was 0.28; intrathoracic lymph node enlargement was 0.03; pleural effusions was 0.03. The distribution in lung: the incidence of central was 0.05; peripheral was 0.74; peripheral involving central was 0.38; diffuse was 0.19; unifocal involvement was 0.09; multifocal involvement was 0.57; unilateral was 0.16; bilateral was 0.83; The incidence of lobes involved (>2) was 0.70; lobes involved ([less double equals]2) was 0.35. Conclusion: GGO, vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening more frequently occurred in patients with COVID-19. Peripheral, bilateral, involved lobes >2 might be the features of COVID-19 in the distribution aspect. Therefore, based on the aboved features of COVID-19 in chest CT imaging, it might be a promising means for identifying COVID-19.

Virus isolation and accurate characterization plays a crucial role in the rapid identification of the causative agents of infectious disease outbreaks especially if the causative viruses are novel where no pre-existing diagnostic reagents would be available. A new cell culture tube, named Jui Meng (JM) Cell Culture Tube, was developed to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency and biosafety of work pertaining to virus isolation. The design of the tube is based heavily on the principle of practicability, functionality, biosafety and long-term cost saving for diagnostic laboratory work in virus isolation. It is designed to culture an initial inoculum of one milliliter of culture medium containing 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cells/ml.

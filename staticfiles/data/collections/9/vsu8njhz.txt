This chapter reviews otolaryngology conditions most commonly seen by pediatricians. Included are issues involving the ears, nose, and nasopharynx; the sinuses, throat, mouth, and oropharynx; and the neck. The most common surgical otolaryngologic procedures will also be discussed. Many of these conditions can be effectively identified, diagnosed, and treated by primary care physicians. However, for certain conditions, prompt identification and timely referral to an otolaryngologist is required.

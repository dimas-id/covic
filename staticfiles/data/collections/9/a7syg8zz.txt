For the COVID-19 pandemic, and for future pandemics, public health authorities at the local, state, and national levels must develop, deploy, and routinely disseminate, in as timely a manner as possible, a standard set of metrics that are goal-aligned with the public health response and that enable collective action by the whole of society, including the general public. An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires nimble, intensive, and effective public health action to minimize spread, suffering, and deaths-as well as socioeconomic and racial inequities in these outcomes. "Epidemic intelligence"-a well-chosen, publicly facing set of metrics aligned with the goals of the public health response-is an important public good sometimes neglected early in emergency responses.

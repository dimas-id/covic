Groups of barrier-raised but not certified virus-free Sprague-Dawley rats, obtained from the same source over the course of several years, were placed on an identical immunosuppressive regimen. This caused reactivation of latent Pneumocystis carinii infection, manifest as P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) of varying severity. Rats were euthanized after 9-12 wk of immunosuppression. An assessment of the severity of the induced PCP was made, based on the total number of organisms extracted from the lungs and their ability to proliferate in short-term cell culture. Serum samples obtained at sacrifice were tested by indirect immunofluorescence for antibodies to coronavirus, parvovirus, Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. A total of 60 rats were examined. Thirty-four of these (57%) developed moderate or severe PCP. No antibodies were detected to either coronavirus or Mycoplasma pulmonis in any of the rats. Although antibodies were detected to parvovirus in 13/60 (22%), to PVM in 29/60 (48%), and to Sendai virus in 47/60 (78%), there was no apparent correlation between the presence or absence of antibodies to these agents and the severity of PCP. Sequential observations during the course of immunosuppression are needed to clarify the role of concomitant infections in the development of PCP.

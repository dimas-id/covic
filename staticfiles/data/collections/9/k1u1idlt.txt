The association between severe bronchiolitis and dual infection by human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) was investigated in !2-year-old infants with bronchiolitis who were admitted to the hospital during the 2001–2002 winter season. hMPV in nasopharyngeal aspirate and/or cells and fluid collected by nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). hRSV was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate and/or cells and fluid collected by nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage by enzyme immunoassay, tissue culture, and RT-PCR. Dual infection with hMPV and hRSV confers a 10-fold increase in relative risk (RR) of admission to a pediatric intensive-care unit for mechanical ventilation (RR, 10.99 [95% confidence interval, 5.0–24.12]; P < .001, by Fisher exact test). Dual infection by hMPV and hRSV is associated with severe bronchiolitis.

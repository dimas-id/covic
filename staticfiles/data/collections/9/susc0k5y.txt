OBJECTIVES: The sudden changes of healthcare system due to COVID-19 particularly affect the organization of psychiatry. The objective of this review is to examine the adaptations of psychiatric care in France during this pandemic. METHOD: This narrative review is based on the observation of changes made in French psychiatric hospitals and on an analysis of the literature. RESULTS: Regarding psychiatric hospitalization, the COVID-19 epidemic required rapid measures that profoundly modified the conditions of patientsâ€™ reception, forcing the medical staffs to adapt their methods of care. The authors noted the creation of at least 89 wards specifically dedicated to patients with COVID-19 needing psychiatric hospitalization, allowing dual care of general medicine and psychiatry. Regarding ambulatory care, maintaining patients with long-term follow-up was a priority. Patients recalling and teleconsultation have been precious resources but cannot entirely replace face-to-face consultations. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 epidemic created unprecedented situation of large-scale upheavals in the healthcare system and in society. Despite the absence of previous recommendations on the subject, French psychiatry has shown great adaptability. Some changes could inspire post-COVID-19 care.

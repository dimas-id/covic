The coronavirus pandemic that began in China at the end of last year, claimed its first confirmed death in Spain at the end of January 2020, where to date, 200,000 infections and 20,852 deaths have been recorded. In addition to the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection described in the literature (fever, dry cough, diarrhea, and respiratory involvement) recently, skin exanthematic lesions have been described. We present three cases (two suspected and one confirmed) of patients presenting ulcers in the oral cavity. Oral manifestations developed during the lock-down period between the last week of March and the first week of April 2020, and consisted of pain, desquamative gingivitis, ulcers and blisters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report describing of a COVID-19 patient with oral manifestations. Intraoral examinations should be carried out in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, always when having the recommended protection measures available to a better understanding of the disease.

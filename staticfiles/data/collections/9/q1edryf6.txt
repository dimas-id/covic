INTRODUCTION Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery is a recently innovated urologic surgical procedure. Transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site adrenalectomy (LESS-A) is technically safe and feasible in patients with benign adrenal tumors. To improve patient counseling and informed consent, we evaluated patient-reported postoperative pain, body image, and cosmetic satisfaction after transumbilical LESS-A. METHODS We reviewed 24 patients who underwent transumbilical LESS-A and assessed their operative and esthetic outcomes and incisional pain. Incisional pain was evaluated using a 10-point visual analog scale, and the body image and cosmetic satisfaction were measured using a questionnaire that included a body image scale (range, 5-20 points) and a cosmetic scale (range, 3-24 points). RESULTS Pure LESS-A was performed on 10 patients using a multichannel port; an additional 5-mm trocar was used in two obese patients. Supplementary to the single-incision approach, one or two 3-mm ports were used in 12 patients. The mean operative time was 203 min; the mean blood loss was 41 mL. The mean pain visual analog scale scores on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7 were 3.5, 2.2 (P = 0.012), and 1.5 points (P = 0.018), respectively. The mean body image scale and cosmetic scale scores indicating wound satisfaction 1 month after the surgery were 20 and 22 points, respectively. Although one patient had liver injury during surgery, the postoperative course during the 3-month follow-up was uneventful. CONCLUSION Transumbilical LESS-A confers less postoperative pain and better cosmetic satisfaction than conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Therefore, this procedure could potentially become a standard treatment option for benign adrenal tumors.

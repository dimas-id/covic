Highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) generally causes severe encephalitis in humans. Respiratory symptoms are infrequently observed, likely reflecting variations in infection kinetics in human airways. Supporting this idea, we recently identified individual differences in NiV replication kinetics in cultured airway epithelia from different human donors. As type III interferons (IFN-λ) represent major players in the defence mechanism against viral infection of the respiratory mucosa, we studied IFN-λ induction and antiviral activity in NiV-infected primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) cultured under air-liquid interface conditions. Our studies revealed that IFN-λ was upregulated in airway epithelia upon NiV infection. We also show that IFN-λ pretreatment efficiently inhibited NiV replication. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of IFN-λ varied in HBEpCs from two different donors. Increased sensitivity to IFN-λ was associated with higher expression levels of IFN-λ receptors, enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1, as well as enhanced induction of interferon-stimulated gene expression. These findings suggest that individual variations in IFN-λ receptor expression affecting IFN responsiveness can play a functional role for NiV replication kinetics in human respiratory epithelial cells of different donors.

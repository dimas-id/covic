We have used cell or tissue-specific promoters to express lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) proteins in selected cells in independent lines of transgenic mice. Upon adoptive transfers into these mice, MHC-restricted LCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes homed specifically to either the choroid plexus (SV40 promoter) or Î² cells of the islets of Langerhans (rat insulin promoter). The availability of promoters specific for neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes makes this approach compelling for evaluating T cell trafficking into the CNS and for analyzing antigen presentation in vivo in the CNS.

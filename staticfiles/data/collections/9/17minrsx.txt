The sentinel node (SN) concept has been found to be feasible in gastric cancer. However, the lymphatic network of gastric cancer may be more complex, and it may be difficult to visualize all the SN distributed in unexpected areas by conventional modalities. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer. A total 24 patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. Three modalities (CT lymphography, dye and radioisotope [RI] methods) were used for the detection of SN. The images of CT lymphography were obtained at 10 min after injection of contrast agents. The SN were successfully identified by CT lymphography in 83.3% of patients; detection rates by the dye and RI methods were 95% and 100%, respectively. Most patients, in whom SN were successfully detected by CT lymphography, had positive results at 5 min after injection of the contrast material. The SN stations detected by CT lymphography were consistent with or included those detected by dye and/or RI methods. In conclusion, CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer is feasible and has several advantages. However, based on this initial experience, CT lymphography had a relatively low detection rate compared with conventional methods, and further efforts will be necessary to improve the detection rate and widen the clinical application of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer.

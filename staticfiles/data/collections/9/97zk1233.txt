Abstract The treatment for most viral infections in children primarily is supportive. Severe viral illnesses and significant secondary complications that require treatment in the intensive care unit may occur in immunocompromised patients and also in infants and children who were previously healthy. Antiviral agents with specific activity against certain respiratory viruses, herpesviruses, and enteric viruses are available. New drugs are under development, and their use in pediatric patients is a subject of active research. The clinician's knowledge of the mechanisms of action, spectrum of activity, and side effects of these drugs is an important tool for their judicious use in the treatment of the critically ill child.

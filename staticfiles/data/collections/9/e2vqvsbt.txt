COVID-19 patients in the critical care unit tend to have prolonged hospital stay requiring high doses of sedation and paralysis to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome, resulting in a shortage of these drugs. In our hospital, we have instituted strategies to rationalise drug and oxygen usage. This includes prioritising time-sensitive elective cases, reducing overall elective case load, favouring opioid-reduction strategies and usage of alternative anaesthetic agents not commonly used in ICU. Both intensive care physicians and anaesthesiologists have to cooperate on drug conservation as similar drugs are used in elective operating lists as in the ICU. Patient safety is of utmost importance and we should keep in mind some pitfalls and ethical concerns of these alternative strategies.

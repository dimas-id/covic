The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus has had devastating consequences across the globe. However, multiple clinics and hospitals have experienced a decrease in rates of acute myocardial infarction and corresponding cardiac catheterization lab activations, raising the question: Has the risk of myocardial infarction decreased during COVID? Sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, and sleep has been importantly impacted during the pandemic, possibly due to the changes in work-home life leading to a lack of structure. We conducted a social media-based survey to assess potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in risk of myocardial infarction. We used validated questionnaires to assess sleep patterns, tobacco consumption and other important health outcomes to test the hypothesis that increases in sleep duration may be occurring which have a beneficial impact on health. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in circadian rhythm, with subjects waking up 105 minutes later during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). Subjects also reported going to sleep 41 minutes later during the pandemic (p < 0.0001). These shifts led to longer duration of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, subjects reported sleeping 6.8 hours per night, which rose to 7.5 hours during the pandemic, a 44 minute or 11% increase (p < 0.0001). We acknowledge the major negative health impact of the global pandemic but would advocate for using this crisis to improve the work and sleep habits of the general population, which may lead to overall health benefits for our society.

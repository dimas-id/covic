The impact on healthcare services in settings with under-resourced health systems, such as Nigeria, is likely to be substantial in the coming months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity services still need to be prioritized as an essential core health service. The healthcare system should ensure the provision of safe and quality care to women during pregnancy, labor, and childbirth, and at the same time, maternity care providers including obstetricians and midwives must be protected and prioritized to continue providing care to childbearing women and their babies during the pandemic. This practical guideline was developed for the management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Nigeria and other low-resource countries.

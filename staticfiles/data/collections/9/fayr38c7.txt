Protein structures solved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) or X-ray crystallography often miss the sugar molecules known as glycans that cover large swaths of the proteins’ surfaces The recently reported structures of the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, are no different Researchers are now working to fill in some of those sugary blanks to better understand the virus’s biology and to help drugmakers develop vaccines and treatments “People usually go for what they can analyze” and focus mostly on the protein components of a structure, says Andrea Thorn, a structural biologist at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg She is a member of the Coronavirus Structural Task Force, a group of scientists who specialize in modeling and processing crystallographic and cryo-EM data Because structural biology measurements don’t reveal much about glycans on proteins, “we often fail to recognize what an important part of the structure they

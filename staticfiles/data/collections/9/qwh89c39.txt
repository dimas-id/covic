Abstract This research focuses on the 2014 Ebola crisis response by emergency managers in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metropolitan region in the State of Texas, U.S.A. It examines the patterns of crisis communication and the use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during the first month of the crisis. Primary data collected from 24 face-to-face interviews and 12 online surveys are analyzed. The research identifies elements contributing to organizational failures, which by their very nature gain public and media attention, and also explicates the less mentioned successful decisions made by response agencies in the DFW region. It is important to investigate both failures and successes to help inform organizational learning for better preparedness to future health crises. Findings suggest that, although there was a breakdown in communication between small city governments/ municipalities and higher levels of government at the State and Federal levels, prior training and collaborative relationships helped in improvised decision-making. Takeaways for practitioners include reiterating the importance of establishing SOPs, merits of flexibility, and improvisational decisions for shared learning.

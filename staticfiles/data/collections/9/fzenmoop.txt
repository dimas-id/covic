BACKGROUND COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health concern affecting over 5 million people and posing a great burden on the health systems worldwide. OBJECTIVE To determine the knowledge, attitude and practice of medical students in Uganda on COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted an online, descriptive cross-sectional study in mid-April 2020, using WhatsApp Messenger. Medical students in 9 of the 10 medical schools in Uganda were approached through convenient sampling. Bloom's cut-off of 80% was used to determine good knowledge (≥12/15), positive attitude (≥20/25) and good practice (≥12/15). RESULTS Data of 741(response rate =30%) 1st- to 5th-year medical students, 468 (63%) male with a mean age of 24 ±4 years was analyzed. Majority (n=626, 84%) were pursuing a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) degree. Overall, 671 (91%) had good knowledge, 550 (74%) had positive attitude and 426 (57%) had good practices. Knowledge was associated with: fourth-year of study (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 4.1 (95% Confidence interval): 1.6-10.3; P<.01). Attitude was associated with: female sex (aOR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5-1; P=.04) and TV/Radio shows (aOR: 1.1; 95%CI: 0.6-2.1; P=.01). Practices was associated with: age ≥ 24 years (aOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1; P=.02) and online course (aOR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-3.2; P=.03). Some 592 (80%) medical students were willing to participate in front-line care if called upon. CONCLUSIONS Medical students in Uganda have sufficient knowledge on COVID-19 and are a large reservoir for healthcare response when the need arises. CLINICALTRIAL

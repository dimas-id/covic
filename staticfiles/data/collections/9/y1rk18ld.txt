The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) is the causal agent of the newly-termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In January 2020, the World Health Association (WHO) declared the CO-VID-19 as an epidemic. Abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients currently are considered as prognostic factors of severity. Our aim is to summarize the current data available in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS An electronic search was performed in the Database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) of the World Health Organization. Thrombin Time (TT), Prothrombin Time (PT), Fibrinogen (FIB), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APPT), and D-Dimer have been detected as parameters to study in every COVID-19 patient. CLINICAL APPLICATION The coagulation function panel has been described to be altered in critical COVID-2019 patients. DIC, which plays an important role in advanced stage, is known to be associated with sepsis. Anticoagulant therapy, mainly with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), appears to be associated with better prognosis in patients with severe COV-ID-19. DISCUSSION Coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection is significantly deranged compared with normal patients. FIB and D-Dimer/FDP are the most significantly altered values and the early deetection of alteration could be useful to address therapies. D-Dimer/FDP (DD/FDP) alteration correlates with severity. Markedly elevated D-Dimer can be used to guide the introduction of anticoagulation therapy and evaluate prognosis of COVID-19. In every patient admitted with SARS-CoV2 infection PT, FIB, D-Dimer/FDP, and platelets must be ordered. We suggest daily extraction for every patient admitted and tested positive for COVID-19.

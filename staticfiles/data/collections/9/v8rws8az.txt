Over the past 20 years, the growing awareness that purinergic signaling events literally shape the immune and inflammatory responses to infection and allergic reactions warranted the development of animal models to assess their importance in vivo in acute lung injury and chronic airway diseases. The pioneer work conducted with the adenosine deaminase (ADA)-deficient mouse provided irrefutable evidence that excess adenosine (ADO) accumulating in the lungs of asthmatic patients, constitutes a powerful mediator of disease severity. These original studies launched the development of murine strains for the two major ectonucleotidases responsible for the generation of airway ADO from ATP release: CD39 and CD73. The dramatic acute lung injury and chronic lung complications, manifested by these knockout mice in response to allergens and endotoxin, demonstrated the critical importance of regulating the availability of ATP and ADO for their receptors. Therapeutic targets are currently evaluated using knockout mice and agonists/antagonists for each ADO receptor (A(1)R, A(2A)R, A(2B)R, and A(3)R) and the predominant ATP receptors (P2Y(2)R and P2X(7)R). This chapter provides an in-depth description of each in vivo study, and a critical view of the therapeutic potentials for the treatment of airway diseases.

Lung disease rivals the position for the top cause of death worldwide. Causes and pathology of the myriad lung diseases are varied, yet nutrition can either affect the outcome or support treatment in the majority of cases. This chapter explores the modifiable risk factors, from lifestyle changes to dietary intake to specific nutrients, anti-nutrients, and toxins helpful for the nutritionist or dietitian working with lung disease patients. General lung health is discussed, and three major disease states are explored in detail, including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Although all lung diseases have diverse causes, many integrative and functional medical nutrition therapies are available and are not being utilized in practice today. This chapter begins the path toward better nutrition education for the integrative and functional medicine professional.

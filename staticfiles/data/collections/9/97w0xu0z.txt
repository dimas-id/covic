In this paper, epidemic spread with the staged progression model on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is studied. First, the epidemic threshold of the simple staged progression model is given. Then the staged progression model with birth and death is also considered. The case where infectivity is a nonlinear function of the nodesâ€™ degree is discussed, too. Finally, the analytical results are verified by numerical simulations.

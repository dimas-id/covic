Fifteen isolates of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were obtained from the kidney, trachea, and cecal tonsil of IB suspected chickens between 2001 and 2002 years in Korea. The S1 glycoprotein gene of IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase â€“ polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Fifteen Korean IBV isolates were classified into 4 groups by their RFLP patterns using restriction enzymes, HaeIII, BstYI, and XcmI. The RFLP patterns for 3, 1, and 1 of 15 isolates corresponded to the patterns of IBV Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts strains, respectively. Ten of 15 isolates generated unique KM91 RFLP pattern that was observed in the IBV KM 91 strain previously isolated in Korea. To confirm genetic diversity in the S1 genes of IBV isolates, viral RNAs of representative 9 of 15 IBV isolates were amplified, cloned, sequenced and compared with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains. Korean IBV isolates showed amino acid sequence similarity between 61.8% (K446-01 and K161-02) and 96.1% (K281-01 and K210-02) with each other and they showed amino acid sequence similarity between 42.9% (K161-02 and GA980470) and 96.5% (K203-02 and KB8523) compared to non-Korean IBV strains. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean IBV field isolates were branched into five clusters in which 3 clusters were differentiated from non-Korean IBV strains. Especially, Korean IBV isolates K069-01, K507-01, K774-01 and K142-02 formed a separate cluster. It seems that IBVs continue to evolve and IBVs showing various genetic differences may cocirculate in Korea.

Neurologic disease is a common presentation of domestic ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) with infectious, neoplastic, and traumatic etiologies documented. Adrenocortical neoplasia is also well documented in domestic ferrets, with metastatic lesions rarely described. This case report describes an abnormal presentation of adrenocortical adenocarcinoma with myxoid differentiation and subsequent metastasis to the spinal cord and vertebral bodies, resulting in hind limb paraplegia in an adult spayed female ferret.

A low frequency leukocyte subpopulation, referred to as natural interferon producing cells (NIPC) is able to produce high amounts of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) following contact with noninfectious viral structures. In order to examine the possible leukocytic nature and bone marrow origin of NIPC, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were reconstituted with porcine leukocyte populations, including bone marrow cells. At different times after reconstitution, enriched CD4 and CD45 positive porcine cells were isolated from various mouse organs and tested for the presence of porcine NIPC by porcine IFN-alpha specific ELISPOT assay, after in vitro stimulation by UV inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Although engraftment of porcine cells in SCID mice was shown by flow cytometry and by the production of pig immunoglobulins, no IFN-alpha secreting cells could be detected. This result suggests that NIPC do not derive from bone marrow precursor cells, or that growth factors needed for in vivo expansion of porcine NIPC were absent in mice.

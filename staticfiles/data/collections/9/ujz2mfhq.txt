BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The optimal treatment for patients with acute stroke refractory to stent-based thrombectomy (SBT) is unclear. This study aimed to report clinical outcomes of manual aspiration thrombectomy (MAT) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke refractory to SBT. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and angiographic data of 30 patients who underwent MAT with a Penumbra reperfusion catheter because of refractory occlusion after SBT with a Solitaire stent as first-line endovascular therapy. Refractory occlusion was defined by a lack of successful revascularization (defined as Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction ≥2b) after five retrieval attempts. A good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of ≤2 at 3 months. RESULTS Successful revascularization was achieved in 83.3% (25/30) of the patients who underwent MAT after failed SBT. There was no arterial rupture or dissection or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Two embolic occlusions in a new arterial territory and five subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred, neither of which caused neurological worsening. At the 3-month follow-up, 36.7% (11/30) of patients exhibited a good outcome. The mortality rate was 6.7% (2/30) at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that MAT with the Penumbra reperfusion catheter can further increase the revascularization rate without serious complications in patients with acute stroke with refractory occlusions after SBT with a Solitaire stent.

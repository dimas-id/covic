OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Various papers related to the application of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for the prevention of occupational disease were reviewed. The Internet was used as the primary tool to search for the necessary research data and information, using such online resources as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, NDSL, and PubMed. The key search terms were “adverse outcome pathway,” “toxicology,” “risk assessment,” “human,” “worker,” “occupational safety and health,” and so on. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The aim of this paper is to explain the use of AOP for the understanding of chemical toxicity as a conceptual means and to predict the toxic mechanism. The tools of AOP have emerged as a forward-looking alternative to the existing chemical risk assessment paradigm. AOP is being applied to the assessment of acute toxicity and to chronic toxic chemicals in the workplace. Not only can it lead to breakthroughs in occupational and environmental cancer prevention, it is also widely used in chemical risk assessment and has led to breakthroughs in the prevention of occupational disease in the workplace.

Abstract Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute multifocal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that typically follows an infectious illness. Its clinical course in most cases is monophasic; however, relapsing ADEM is rarely seen, which poses a diagnostic challenge for distinguishing this disease from multiple sclerosis (MS). Although typically encountered in children, it also occurs in adults with disease characteristics slightly different from the pediatric cases. Formerly, ADEM occurred particularly often in children with measles. However, the illness most often follows a non-descript viral or even bacterial infectious illness. ADEM occurs throughout the world, and may even be more common in less-developed countries, where MS is rare, than in developed ones, where MS is common. Children seldom get MS as opposed to adults, indicating that ADEM constitutes a distinct entity from MS. The prognosis of ADEM is generally good, but severe neurologic sequelae after ADEM are occasionally seen. In this chapter, the etiology, clinical/laboratory/radiologic characteristics, treatment options, and prognosis of ADEM are discussed.

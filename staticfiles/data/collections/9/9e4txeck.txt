The number of hospitalized cases has declined significantly in Wuhan. However, there have been reports that several cases of re‐detectable positive SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in recovered COVID‐19 patients, the potential reasons of re‐detectable positive patients remained elusive. Here, we report three confirmed cases of COVID‐19 whose IgM was negative and IgG was positive before the first discharge, while nasopharyngeal swab test of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA turned positive again during hotel isolation. In addition, all three cases presented negative results for IgM antibodies and positive results for IgG antibodies during re‐admission period. These cases suggested that the reasons for re‐detectable positive patients with profile of antibodies may be related to several factors. It is necessary to quarantine COVID‐19 patients for 14 days after discharge, and the role of antibodies in anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 warrants further investigation. This article is protected by copyright.

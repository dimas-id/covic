BACKGROUND Although monopolar electrocautery is preferred by many laparoscopic surgeons and is more cost-effective than bipolar or ultrasonic scissors, few studies have compared these outcomes between different monopolar electrocautery devices used in laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, this study compared the surgical outcomes between monopolar endo-hook versus endo-shears during laparoscopic right hemicolectomy for right colon cancer. METHODS Using a prospective database of patients treated at our institute, we analyzed the surgical outcomes of 358 consecutive patients with right colon cancer who underwent curative laparoscopic surgery with a monopolar endo-hook (n = 164) or endo-shears (n = 194) between March 2009 and March 2017. RESULTS There were no differences in age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists' grade, previous operative history, or clinical stage between the endo-hook and endo-shears groups. The estimated blood loss was similar between the endo-hook and endo-shears groups (90.9 ± 60.3 vs. 92.0 ± 89.3 mL; P = 0.893). The number of harvested lymph nodes was greater in the endo-hook group (53.5 ± 20.3 vs. 48.1 ± 18.5; P = 0.008). Hospital stay was shorter in the endo-hook group (6.8 ± 2.2 vs. 7.8 ± 4.8 days; P = 0.013). Although chylous ascites was more frequent in the endo-hook group (21.3% vs. 7.7%, P < 0.001), the postoperative morbidity rate was lower in this group (9.8% vs. 18.0%; P = 0.025). All instances of chylous ascites healed spontaneously without intervention. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that the use of a monopolar endo-hook during laparoscopic right hemicolectomy might permit more meticulous lymph-node dissection and reduce morbidity compared with the use of monopolar endo-shears. Therefore, we suggest that the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery might be associated with the type of electrocautery device used.

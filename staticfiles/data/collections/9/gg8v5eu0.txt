PURPOSE Pancreatic fistula represents the most important complication in terms of clinical management and costs after pancreaticoduodenectomy. A lot of studies have investigated several techniques in order to reduce pancreatic fistula, but data on the effect of sutures material on pancreatic fistula are not available. The analysis investigated the role of suture material in influencing pancreatic fistula rate and severity. METHODS Results from 130 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreaticojejunostomy performed between March 2013 and September 2014 were prospectively collected and analyzed. In 65 cases pancreaticojejunostomy was performed with absorbable sutures, in the other 65 cases using non-absorbable sutures (polyester, silk and polybutester). RESULTS Pancreaticojejunostomy with non-absorbable sutures had the same incidence of pancreatic fistula, but less severe and with less episodes of post-operative bleeding if compared with absorbable sutures. A sub-analysis was carried out comparing polydioxanone with polyester: the latter was associated with a lower pancreatic fistula rate (11.9% vs. 31.7%; p = 0,01) and less severe pancreatic anastomosis dehiscence (grade C - 0% vs. 30%; p = 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that hard pancreatic texture, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at final histology and the use of polyester for pancreaticojejunostomy were associated with a lower pancreatic fistula rate (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of pancreatic juice and bile on different sutures and pancreatic tissue response to different materials. However, pancreaticojejunostomy performed with polyester sutures is safe and feasible and is associated to a lower incidence of pancreatic fistula with less severe clinical impact.

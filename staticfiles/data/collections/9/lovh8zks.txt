Sterile magnetic drapes are frequently used during surgery to hold metal instruments on the sterile field. Magnetic fields may potentially interfere with the function of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. In this study, we evaluated the potential magnetic interference of magnetic drapes on pacemaker function. A magnetic drape with 70 magnets was placed with its approximate center over the pacemaker of 50 patients during their visit to the cardiology clinic. In those pacemakers that demonstrated magnetic interference, the drape was pulled caudally in 3-cm increments until the interference ceased. If there was no interference, the drape was folded in 2 over the pacemaker. The number of magnets necessary to maintain magnetic interference with the pacemaker was also tested. Magnetic interference was observed in the pacemakers of 47 (94%) patients: 35 with the unfolded drape and another 12 with the folded drape. Patients whose pacemakers had interference with the unfolded drape weighed less (68 ± 15 kg vs 81 ± 19 kg; P = 0.016) than those who had no interference. In 54% of patients, magnetic interference ceased when the drape was pulled 3 cm caudally and at 15 cm, no pacemaker had magnetic interference. Magnetic drapes may cause magnetic interference with cardiac pacemakers, and this interference ceases at a caudal distance of 15 cm. Magnetic interference seems more likely in patients with lower body weight. Careful monitoring of the pulse and electrocardiogram for asynchronous pacing activity should be considered when magnetic drapes are used in patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices.

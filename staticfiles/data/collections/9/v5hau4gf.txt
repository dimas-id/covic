This case report describes the clinical characteristics of a 50-year-old woman that developed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and was admitted at the COVID-19 dedicated unit where she developed neurological symptoms 10 days after admission. After neurological examination, including a panel of blood cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, a diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) was hypothesized and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) was initiated. Fourteen days after the start of IVIG treatment, the patient has been discharged at home with the resolution of respiratory symptoms and only minor hyporeflexia at the lower limbs, without any side effect.

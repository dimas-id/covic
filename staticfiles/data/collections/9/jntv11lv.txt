A prospective study was conducted to identify the viruses causing respiratory diseases in unconditioned, random-source dogs. During the quarantine period, respiratory disease occurred in 86 of 167 (52%) dogs, and 34 (21%) died. Most affected dogs had a distemper-like illness which required extensive and prolonged care. Histopathologic studies confirmed the diagnosis of canine distemper in 10 of 12 (83%) fatal infections examined. Sixty-seven of 91 (74%) dogs which arrived without canine distemper antibody became ill, and 30 (32%) died. In contrast, only 16 of 67 (24%) dogs with canine distemper antibody had respiratory disease, and only 3 (4%) died. Parainfluenza SV5 and canine adenovirus--type II were recovered from 27 of 54 and 22 of 54 sick dogs, respectively. Canine herpesviruses, canine coronaviruses, and canine parvoviruses were less frequently isolated. Increased antibody titers to SV5 were found consistently, and rises in titer to the other viruses were demonstrated. Many of the sick dogs were infected with two or more viruses. Although several viral agents were detected during these epizootics, prevention of canine distemper appeared to be the key to controlling severe, prolonged, and often fatal respiratory disease.

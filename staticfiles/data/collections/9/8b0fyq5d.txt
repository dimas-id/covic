INTRODUCTION Recent studies have described the benefits of performing bowel resections for benign and malignant diseases as a total laparoscopic procedure with intra-corporeal anastomosis. We describe our preliminary experience with total laparoscopic surgery for benign lower gastrointestinal diseases. METHODS All patients (n = 32) who had received elective bowel surgery with intra-corporeal anastomosis for benign diseases between November 2013 and August 2015 were included in this retrospective study. RESULTS A total of 15 patients (47%) had a primary anastomosis, 17 patients (53%) had a stoma reversal. The median length of stay was five days (range: 3-16). Surgical complications requiring re-operation were present in five patients (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb) of whom two presented with anastomotic leaks (6%; 95% confidence interval: 2-20%). No post-operative medical complications according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification were seen. The median duration of surgery was 127 min. (range: 61-211 min.). No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION A total laparoscopic approach to benign lower gastrointestinal diseases with intra-corporeal ana-stomosis was feasible. FUNDING none. TRIAL REGISTRATION The trial is registered with the Danish Data Protection Agency.

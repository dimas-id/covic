The effect of weaning calves at different ages (NW = not weaned, W5 = 5.5 months old and W2 = weaned after being born and then fed with natural Holstein Friesian milk until 2 months old), on animal performance and carcass and Longissimus thoracis muscle quality, was studied in 36 eight month-old Rubia Gallega calves. Feed ingestions, weight gains, slaughter (SW) and carcass weights (CW), carcass conformation and fat scores, and meat characteristics (24 hours postmortem): colour, pH, water holding capacity, chemical composition and texture (Warner Bratzler (WB) test, sensory panel), were studied. NW calves showed the highest SW and CW (P < 0.001). Yellowness (b*), redness (a*) and chroma (C*) were higher in NW than W2 calves (P < 0.05). Shear firmness was higher in W2 than in NW and W5 veal. W2 veal was less elastic (P < 0.05), tender (P < 0.05) and juicy (P < 0.01) than NW and W5 veal.

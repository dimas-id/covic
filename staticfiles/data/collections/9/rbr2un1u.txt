The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first reported to cause human infection in September 2012. In July 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee determined that MERS-CoV did not meet criteria for a "public health emergency of international concern," but was nevertheless of "serious and great concern". This report summarizes epidemiologic information and provides updates to CDC guidance about patient evaluation, case definitions, travel, and infection control as of September 20, 2013.

BACKGROUND Valvuloplastic esophagogastrostomy by double flap technique (VEG-DFT) is a promising procedure to prevent reflux after proximal gastrectomy (PG), and is achieved by the burial of the abdominal esophagus into the gastric submucosa; however, laparoscopic VEG-DFT is technically demanding due to complicated suturing and ligation maneuvers. The present study was designed to determine the feasibility and safety of robotic VEG-DFT. METHODS After robotic PG, seromuscular flaps were extracorporeally created at the anterior wall of the remnant stomach through a small umbilical incision. Then, using a robot, the posterior wall of the esophagus was fixed to the cranial end of the mucosal window, and layer-to-layer sutures were placed between the anterior aspects of esophagus and the remnant stomach. Finally, the anastomosis was covered by seromuscular flaps. Short-term outcomes of 12 consecutive patients who underwent VEG-DFT between January 2014 and December 2015 were assessed. RESULTS Operations were successfully completed using robotic assistance in all patients. Median operative, surgeon console, and anastomosis times were 406 (324-613 min), 267 (214-483), and 104 (76-186) min, respectively, and median estimated blood loss was 31 (5-130) ml. The first six cases were required to reach a learning plateau. Both mortality and morbidity rates within 30 days after surgery were 0%. Postoperative hospital stay was 10 (9-30) days. No postoperative reflux esophagitis was observed, whereas anastomotic stenosis, which required endoscopic balloon dilation, developed in three patients (25%) in postoperative month 2. There was a significant association between the total number of stitches used for VEG-DFT and anastomotic stenosis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Robotic assistance may be useful for VEG-DFT with a short learning curve. Attention is required to prevent postoperative anastomotic stenosis possibly caused by an excessive number of stitches for esophagogastrostomy.

Interventional Pulmonology (IP) is experiencing a rapid evolution of new technologies. There is a need to develop structured training programs, organized in high volume expert centres in order to improve trainee education, and including the development of validated metrics for their competency assessment. Concerning teaching methods, a gradual progression from theory to practice, using new teaching techniques, including live sessions and low and high fidelity simulation, flipped classroom models and problem-based learning (PBL) exercises would provide a training setting more suitable for our current need to improve skills and update professionals. Training programs should be learner centered and competence-oriented, as well as being based on a spiral-shaped approach in which the same subject is addressed many times, from new and different perspectives of knowledge, ability, behaviour and attitude, until the trainee has demonstrated a high degree of skill and professionalism5. Furthermore there is a need to standardize the training programs as guide for physicians wishing to undertake a gradual and voluntary improvement of their own competencies, and assist those planning and organizing training programs in IP. The article includes a general part on Core Curriculum contents, innovative training methods and simulation, and introduces the following articles on the skills hat the Interventional Pulmonologist must master in order to perform the different procedures. This monography should be considered a starting point that will evolve over time and results in better training for practitioners and better care for our patients. The task of establishing a trainee's competence to practice independently as an Interventional Pulmonologist remains the responsibility of the IP fellowship program director and faculty, who validate logbooks and assess competence for each procedure. These standards need to be reviewed and approved by national and International Scientific Societies and Healthcare Institutions with the aim to improve, disseminate and incorporate them in healthcare programs.

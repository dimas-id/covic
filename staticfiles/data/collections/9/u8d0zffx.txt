INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the long-term evolution of tongue somatosensory evoked potentials (tSSEP) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). METHODS: Out of initial 121 participants, after two-year follow-up, the data were available for 74 and after four-year follow-up for 58 pwMS. In all pwMS complete neurological examination, brain MRI, cervical spinal cord MRI (if available) and tSSEP were performed at baseline visit (M0). Complete neurological examination and tSSEP were performed 2 and 4 years later (M24 and M48). tSSEP results were interpreted in the form of ordinal tSSEP score and quantitative tSSEP zscore calculated from the sum of z-transformed tSSEP latencies. RESULTS: Differences in tSSEP scores and tSSEP zscores in three different timepoints showed significant worsening of both scores over time. For the tSSEP score the difference was significant for M0-M24 and M0-M48 visits, but not for M24-M48 visits. For the tSSEP zscore the difference was significant for M0-M48 and M24-M48 visits, but not for M0-M24 visits. The only significant negative predictor found for the tSSEP score improvement was presence of cervical spinal cord lesions on the MRI. A moderate to high correlation was observed between both forms of tSSEP score at all three timepoints. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant deterioration of trigeminal sensory pathway in MS over time, giving further insight into trigeminal system damage in pwMS.

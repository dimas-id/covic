This chapter examines the operations of the World Bank (a multilateral development institution), the International Monetary Fund (a multilateral financial institution) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (a multilateral fundraising and financing institution) to fight HIV/AIDS. We also examine the role of bilateral donors and the private sector in financing the fight against HIV/AIDS. We examine the relationships among bilateral donors and international organizations, what distinguishes their roles in the global HIV/AIDS pandemic and the extent to which their activities overlap. In addition, we consider how funding strategies and parameters may affect the effectiveness of AIDS funding in preventing transmission and providing treatment.

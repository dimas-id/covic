ABSTRACT Background A novel viral strain known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created a worldwide pandemic known as Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Early reports from China highlighted the risks associated with performing endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We present a rare complication of nasoseptal flap (NSF) necrosis associated with COVID-19, further emphasizing the challenges of performing these procedures in this era. Case Description A 78-year-old male underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum resection of a pituitary macroadenoma for decompression of the optic chiasm. The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF). The patient developed meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak on post-operative day thirteen requiring revision repair of the defect. Twelve days later, he developed persistent fevers and rhinorrhea. The patient was re-explored endoscopically, and the NSF was noted to be necrotic and devitalized with evident CSF leakage. At that time, the patient tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. Post-operatively, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and death. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of NSF necrosis in a patient with COVID-19. We postulate that the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 may have contributed to vascular pedicle thrombosis and NSF necrosis. Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on the nasal tissues is still being elucidated, this case highlights some challenges of performing endoscopic skull base surgery in the era of COVID-19.

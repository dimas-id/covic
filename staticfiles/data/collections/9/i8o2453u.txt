A 27-year-old man presented to our hospital with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. This patient showed imaging findings of diffuse bronchiolitis, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations. Antibiotics were not effective, and we performed bronchoalveolar lavage, in which only human rhinovirus infection was detected by multiplex PCR testing.

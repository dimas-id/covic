The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic since its outbreak in December 2019, which posed a threat to the safety and well-being of people on a global scale. Cancer patients are at high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and their critical morbidity and case fatality rates are high. The ablation expert committee of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology compiled corresponding expert recommendations. These recommendations summarize the preventive measures and management of tumor ablation treatment in medical institutions, including outpatient clinics, oncology wards, ablation operation room, and postablation follow-ups in accordance with the guidelines and protocols imposed by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and the experience in management and prevention according to various hospitals. This consensus aims to reduce and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its cross-infection between cancer patients in hospitals and provide regulatory advice and guidelines for medical personnel.

Publisher Summary This chapter provides an introduction to the book that focus on environmental microbiology. The book defines the important microorganisms that are involved in environmental microbiology, the nature of the different possible environments in which they are situated, the methodologies used to monitor microorganisms and their activities, and the possible effects of microorganisms on human activities. The book addresses the new challenges of modern environmental microbiology, in which pathogens and bioremediation remain fundamental to the field. However, in both cases, the subject areas have been greatly enhanced through the application of molecular genetics and biotechnological tools. Another important area that has been included is that of molecular ecology, which involves investigating diversity in the environment and mining and exploiting that diversity for new natural products and activities. Thus, this book can be used in teaching environmental microbiology as well as a general reference book for practitioners in the field of environmental microbiology.

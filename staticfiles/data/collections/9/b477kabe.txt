The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the declaration of pandemic by the World Health Organization have made an enormous impact on medical and dental care across the world. The current COVID-19 situation may teach dental teams a better approach and optimal ways concerning the management of patients with special needs, by bringing people together to discuss and optimize standards of care, as often happens in challenging situations. We can always learn new things that turn out to be valuable and useful even in exceptionally difficult times, and in addition, dental services can benefit from enabling positive attitudes and introducing constructive changes. Clinicians just need to keep in mind that adjustment to a new future reality appears inevitable for both patients and professionals who provide care.

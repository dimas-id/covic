Awake craniotomies represent an essential opportunity in the case of lesions in eloquent areas. Thus, optimal surveillance of the patient during different stages of sedation, as well as the detection of seizure activity during brain surgery, remains difficult, as skin electrodes for electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis are not applicable in most cases. We assessed the applicability of ECoG to monitor different stages of sedation, as well as the influence of different patient characteristics, such as tumour volume, size, entity, and age or gender on permutation entropy (PeEn). We conducted retrospective analysis of the ECoG data of 16 patients, who underwent awake craniotomies because of left-sided brain tumours at our centre between 2014 and 2016. PeEn could be easily calculated and compared using frontal and parietal cortical electrodes. A comparison of PeEn scores showed significantly higher values in awake patients than in patients under anaesthesia (p â‰¤ 0.004) and significantly higher ones in the state of transition than under general anaesthesia (p = 0.023). PeEn scores in frontal and parietal leads did not differ significantly, making them both applicable for continuous surveillance during brain surgery. None of the following clinical characteristics showed significant correlation with PeEn scores: tumour volume, WHO grade, first or recurrent tumour, gender, and sex. Being 50 years or older led to significantly lower values in parietal leads but not in frontal leads. ECoG and a consecutive analysis of PeEn are feasible and suitable for the continuous surveillance of patients during awake craniotomies. Hence, the analysis is not influenced by patients' clinical characteristics.

Acute management of ischemic stroke is a burning topic in 2017 since stroke represents the leading cause of acquired handicap in adults. Over the last past years, major improvement took place, especially with the demonstration of the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy, thus needing to better organize care pathways, and optimize access to neurologists and interventional neuroradiology platforms. Intensive care stroke units remain the pivotal place of patients' management. A multidisciplinary coordination is required, with continuous teaching of all the actors involved in stroke management, so as to increase the number of patients who could benefit from available active treatments.

Positive-stranded RNA viruses include important human, animal and plant pathogens. Their genomes are able to fold into complex structures stabilized by base pairing between individual nucleotides, many of which are highly conserved and have essential functions during virus replication. With new studies and technological advances the diversity of roles, mechanisms and interactions in which such structured viral RNA functions is becoming increasingly clear. It is also evident that many RNA structures do not function as discrete elements but through mechanisms involving multiple, long-range and often dynamic RNARNA interactions. Through a range of examples and recent advances, this review illustrates the diverse roles and mechanisms of structured viral RNA during the replication of positive-stranded RNA viruses infecting humans and animals.

Reperfusion therapy is a measure of care in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which should be performed once we have the diagnosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention is considered the gold standard, however in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reperfusion strategy is more focused on fibrinolytic therapy due to the shorter time required to perform and less exposure. This pandemic represents a contact problem in health personnel, since cases are increasing worldwide, so it is important to know the measures that must be followed to avoid coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

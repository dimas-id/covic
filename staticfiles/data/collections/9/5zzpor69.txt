BACKGROUND Emergency medical care is performed in an uncontrolled environment and involves invasive procedures and life support measures. The performance of these duties places emergency care practitioners (ECPs) at risk of occupationally acquired injuries and communicable diseases. Although legislative guidelines exist for the protection of healthcare workers, little is known about the protective measures available for and utilised by ECPs in the pre-hospital environment in South Africa. OBJECTIVES To review the availability and implementation of emergency medical services (EMS)-specific infection control policies and standard operating procedures in the pre-hospital environment. METHODS Interviews with key informants were used to collect data concerning policies on communicable diseases and infection control in the EMS, the operational aspects of these policies, and educational programmes on communicable diseases and infection control for ECPs. RESULTS There is no national policy on communicable diseases and infection control in EMS. Only KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng have EMS-specific standard operating procedures for communicable diseases and infection control. Formal education and in-service training is limited. CONCLUSIONS A national communicable disease and infection control policy specific to the EMS needs to be developed together with an accredited training module on communicable diseases and infection control for EMS in the pre-hospital environment.

The MIDnight study carried out in a geriatric hospital confirms the hypothesis of gaps between recommendations and off‐label use of drugs, like midazolam. Such gaps expose patients to risks and prescribers to legal issues. However, withdrawing midazolam would be an additional risk since it would deprive patients of an unequalled drug. The authors of the article [1] chose to deal with this dilemma in a multi‐phase evaluation program aimed at analyzing practices, understanding use factors, and producing recommendations to make prescriptions and their use in the elderly safer.

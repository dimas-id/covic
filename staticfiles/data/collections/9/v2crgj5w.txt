Infectious and noninfectious pulmonary diseases are commonly found on postmortem autopsy studies in patients with hematological malignancy. Despite the technological advances in diagnostic testing and imaging modalities, obtaining an accurate clinical diagnosis remains difficult and often not possible until autopsy. Major diagnostic discrepancies between clinical premortem diagnoses and postmortem autopsy findings have been reported in these patients. The most common missed diagnoses are due to opportunistic infections and cardiopulmonary complications. These findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance, monitoring and treatment of infections and cardiopulmonary disorders in these patients. Autopsies remain important in determining an accurate cause of death and for improved understanding of diagnostic deficiencies, as well as for medical education and quality assurance.

OBJECTIVES The 5MAX ACE is a new large bore aspiration catheter available for vessel recanalization for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We report our initial experience with its use. METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy for AIS using the 5MAX ACE reperfusion catheter at our institution was performed. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics and procedural data were obtained from chart review. Successful recanlization was defined as achievement of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score (TICI) 2b-3 and time to recanalization was defined as time from groin puncture to achievement of at least TICI 2b recanalization. RESULTS The 5MAX ACE was used in 15 patients from July-October 2013. Direct aspiration was used as the primary technique in 10/15 (67%) patients. Out of these, aspiration alone was sufficient for recanalization in 3 (20%) patients. In the remaining 7 (47%) patients, additional devices were used. In 5/15 (33%) patients, combined aspiration/stentriever thrombectomy using Solitaire™ (3/5 patients) and Penumbra 3D Separator™ (2/5 patients) were used as the primary technique. Successful recanlization (TICI 2b-3) was achieved in 11/15 (73%) patients. Average time from groin puncture to successful recanalization was 46 +/- 30 minutes (range 14-98 minutes). There were no procedural complications. CONCLUSION The 5MAX ACE is a useful recanalization tool, either by direct aspiration or combined stentriever/aspiration. It may be most advantageous with large clots in the internal carotid artery. The potential for effective and faster recanalization using this device alone or in combination may be a good topic for future study.

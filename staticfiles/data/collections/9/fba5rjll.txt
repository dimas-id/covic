Priming of autoreactive T cells in lymph nodes by dendritic cells (DCs) is critical for the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). DC activation reflects a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. One anti-inflammatory factor is prostaglandin D2 signaling through its cognate receptor, D-prostanoid receptor 1 (PTGDR), on myeloid cells. Loss of PTGDR signaling might be expected to enhance DC activation and EAE but here we show that PTGDR(−/)(−) mice developed only mild signs of MOG(35-55) peptide immunization-induced EAE. Compared to wild type mice, PTGDR(−/)(−) mice exhibited less demyelination, decreased leukocyte infiltration and diminished microglia activation. These effects resulted from increased pro-inflammatory responses in the lymph nodes, most notably in IL-1β production, with the unexpected consequence of increased activation-induced apoptosis of MOG(35-55) peptide-specific T cells. Conditional deletion of PTGDR on DCs, and not other myeloid cells ameliorated EAE. Together, these results demonstrate the indispensable role that PGD(2)/PTGDR signaling on DCs has in development of pathogenic T cells in autoimmune demyelination.

OBJECTIVE To examine the immunological reactions between the peptides of SARS coronavirus (SARS-Cov) S-protein and the serum of SARS patients for identifying the SARS-Cov epitope. METHODS The peptides from S1 domain of SARS-Cov S-protein were synthesized by peptide synthesizer, and the immunological reaction of the peptides with the serum of SARS patients were examined by means of ELISA. RESULTS The optical density value of the immunological reaction of synthesized 8 peptides with SARS patient serum was 1.5-2.6 times higher than that with normal serum. CONCLUSION The 8 peptides from S1 domain of S protein appear to have low immunogenicity to the serum of SARS patients, indicating that these peptides may not be the epitope of the SARS-Cov.

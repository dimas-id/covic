Respiratory rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recognized as a cornerstone for the therapeutic path. Physiotherapy involves physical activity with aerobic and anaerobic exercises, which can improve the patient's symptomatic picture, such as motor function, emotional status (depression and anxiety), and improve the pain perception. The training of proprioception is not included in the structure of the exercises proposed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The training of proprioception is a very useful strategy for stimulating the cerebellum, a neurological suffering area in patients with COPD. The cerebellum sorts information about pain and emotions, as well as motor stimuli. The article discusses the need to introduce proprioception in respiratory rehabilitation protocols, highlighting the neurological relationships with the management of comorbidities.

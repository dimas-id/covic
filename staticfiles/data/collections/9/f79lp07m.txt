AIM Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of SARS, an emerging disease characterized by atypical pneumonia. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with the nucleocapsid (N)protein of SARS-CoV as a bait, the N protein was found to interact with MAP19, a non-enzymatic protein of MASP(mannan-associated serine protease). The interaction between SARS-CoV N and MAP19 would be further tested in cells in this article. METHODS The interaction between SARS-CoV N and MAP19 was demonstrated by immuno- coprecipitation, and the amount of MAP19 influenced by SARS-CoV N was investgated by Western blot. RESULTS The interaction between SARS-CoV N and MAP19 was already demonstrated by immuno-coprecipitation. SARS-CoV N greatly increased the amount of MAP19. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV N can bind with MAP19 in cells. Our study may be conductive to further research into the molecular mechanism of action between SARS-CoV N and MAP19.

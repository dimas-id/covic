Abstract Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2infection, many recommendations have been made. However, the very nature of acute lymphoblastic leukemias and their treatment in children and adolescents led the Leukemia Committee of the French Society for the fight against Cancers and leukemias in children and adolescents (SFCE) to propose more specific recommendations, even if data for this population are still scarce. They may have to evolve according to the rapid evolution of knowledge on COVID19.

Aim: The main purpose of the study is to assess the awareness of a group of Egyptians about COVID-19 infection and their perception of the role of dentists in its prevention. Subjects and methods: An observational cross-sectional survey included 74 participants who attended Minia University Dental Hospital, Minia City, Egypt, from 10 March to 2 April 2020. A face-to-face interview using an anonymous questionnaire was carried out in this study. The questionnaire contained 20 questions divided into three parts; the first part included the participants’ baseline characteristics. The second part analyzed the participants' awareness of COVID-19 infection through ten questions. Finally, four questions outlined participants' perception of the role of dentists in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Results: Overall participant awareness was adequate at 55.4%. The percentages of “good” and “poor” overall awareness scores were 40.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Most respondents' perception of dentists' role in COVID-19 prevention was poor. All baseline characteristics showed no statistically significant difference related to the participants' awareness about COVID-19 infection and its spread (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: From the findings of the present pilot study, it can be concluded that the general population's awareness of COVID-19 infection and its route of transmission was adequate. Participants' understanding of the role of dentists in COVID-19 prevention was poor.

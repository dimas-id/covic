BACKGROUND The separation of autologous and functional active components of the lateral abdominal wall for closing large midline defects was introduced in 1990. The original components separation technique (CS) has undergone numerous modifications. The aim of this work is to summarise the essential steps of the development. METHODS Based on a literature review, the original technique, the modifications and advancements are presented and evaluated regarding indication, techniques and results. RESULTS The original technique still has a high status, because of the large extent of rectus complex medialisation. Numerous modifications of the anterior conventional component separation with different clinical results were described. The development of a minimally invasive technique with balloon dilatation trocars was an essential step and decreased wound morbidity. The modified posterior component separation by transverse abdominis release currently seems to be an encouraging alternative to be regarded as a widening of the sublay technique. All methods can be combined with implantation of prosthetic or biological implants in intraperitoneal, sublay or onlay technique, whereby the recurrence rate can be decreased. CONCLUSION From where we stand today no single technique can generally be recommended. The latest methods aim for decreasing complications and recurrences by means of minimally invasive procedures. The surgical strategy still depends on the complexity and extent of abdominal wall defect and has to be determined according to individual aspects and sometimes requires an interdisciplinary approach.

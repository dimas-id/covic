INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) procedures in relation to suture material used for apical suspension. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for two senior surgeons who supervised and performed USLS with both suture types in 2008-2009. Permanent and delayed absorbable sutures were compared for failure of anatomical support. Failure, defined as recurrent prolapse beyond the hymen, was evaluated using survival analysis. RESULTS Two hundred forty-eight procedures were performed. One percent in the permanent group had a loss of support beyond the hymen compared to 6% in the delayed absorbable group (p = 0.034). The preoperative prolapse stage and duration of follow-up did not differ between the two groups. The number of sutures used did not differ between patients who failed and those who did not fail. CONCLUSIONS The use of permanent sutures for USLS of the vaginal apex was associated with a lower failure rate than delayed absorbable sutures in the short-term.

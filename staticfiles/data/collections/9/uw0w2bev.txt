Neoplasia is a common cause of disease in domestic ferrets worldwide. The most common neoplasms are islet cell tumors (insulinoma), adrenocortical neoplasms, and lymphoma. The definitive etiology has yet to be defined, but husbandry, genetic predisposition and infectious agents are postulated causes. Definitive diagnosis requires sampling and microscopic analysis of the neoplasm, but initial testing including blood, urine and diagnostic imaging can aid the diagnostic process. Based on the type of tumor and its location, therapeutic options include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Numerous chemotherapeutic protocols and drugs have been published for the use in ferrets and a ferret specific formula for calculating body surface area has been established. In addition to the more commonly affected endocrine and hemolymphatic systems, ferrets can also develop tumors in the skin and subcutis, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, musculoskeletal, nervous, urinary, respiratory and vascular systems.

The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis in Toronto in the spring of 2003 had major consequences for prenatal learners. Classes in hospitals were cancelled; many couples were left without any prenatal education. This paper outlines the decision-making process of one programme that was determined to keep classes open. The impact of SARS on hospital procedures is also described. Childbirth educators are encouraged to prepare for future public health emergencies. Strategies to prepare for conducting childbirth education classes during times of crisis are outlined.

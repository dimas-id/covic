OBJECTIVES To report the recommendations of an expert panel to reorganize Neurourology units and to prioritize examinations and both conservative and surgical treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-systematic review of the literature and national experts' opinion summarizing the recommendations in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of neurourological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified nominal group technique was used due to extraordinary meeting and mobility restrictions during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Neurourological patients have special physiological and pathological characteristics that make them more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. For prioritization purposes, they encompass in Functional Urology patients and their management is considered non-urgentor delayable with no specific deadline of recovery from normality. However, it is important to identify individual situations jeopardising the upper urinary tract, urinary retention or predisposing to urinary infections/sepsis. A classification is provided prioritizing conservative/outpatient management and the surgical treatment of the events occurring in neurourological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In neurourological patients we can find exceptional clinical situations in which a delayed treatment could develop irreversible changes in the upper urinary tract, advocating a more urgent treatment inspecific scenarios.

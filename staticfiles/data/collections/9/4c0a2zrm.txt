The option prioritization is the most effective preference ranking approach within the framework of the graph model for conflict resolution, in which a set of option statements for each decision maker (DM) involved in a dispute is determined by individual judgments. Inevitably, some option statements may be unnecessary or redundant. To address the redundancy of option statements, a novel option statement reduction method as well as an effective reduction algorithm is developed in this research based on the rough set theory. Furthermore, the Elmira conflict is utilized to show how the proposed option statement reduction method can be employed for efficiently eliminating redundant option statements of DMs.

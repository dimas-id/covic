OBJECTIVE: To present an established practice protocol for safe and effective hospital-setting ophthalmic practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Literature was reviewed to identify articles relevant to COVID-19 pandemic and ophthalmology. The following keywords were used: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and telemedicine, combined with eye, ophthalmology, conjunctivitis and tears. Data were extracted from the identified manuscripts and discussed among subspecialists to obtain consensus evidence-based practice. RESULTS: A protocol for ophthalmic practice in the era of COVID-19 pandemic was established. The protocol covered patient screening, clinic flow, required personal protective equipment and modifications of ophthalmic equipment for improved safety. CONCLUSION: Important literature emerged with respect to the practice of ophthalmology in the era of COVID-19. An evidence-based ophthalmic practice protocol was established and should be modified in the future to accommodate new insights on the COVID-19 pandemic.

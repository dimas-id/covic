Measurement of serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) is used to assess exocrine pancreatic function in dogs and cats. Ferrets ( Mustela putorius furo) serve as valuable animal models for human diseases such as cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary diseases, and may be a useful model of other diseases including pancreatitis. We developed and analytically validated a competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measurement of TLI in ferret serum by determination of analytical sensitivity, assay linearity, accuracy of spiking recovery, precision, and reproducibility. Analytical sensitivity of the assay was 0.55 μg/L. Observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio for dilutional parallelism was 90.2-127.9% (mean: 108.1 ± 11.9%). The O/E ratio for spiking recovery was 94.5-113.0% (mean: 103.9 ± 7.2%). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 2.7-5.7% and 3.5-8.2%, respectively. The reference interval (RI) for serum TLI derived from 31 healthy ferrets was 28-115 μg/L; the 90% confidence interval for the lower and upper limits of the RI were 10.0-32.1 μg/L and 103-126 μg/L, respectively. This TLI RIA is analytically sensitive, sufficiently linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible for the measurement of TLI in ferret serum samples.

Background: Clear cell hidradenoma (acrospiroma) is adnexal tumors that arise from the distal excretory duct of eccrine sweat glands. It is generally defined in humanbeings. It presents solitary structure in firmness nodule. Most frequently are encountered in head, face, and upper extremities in humans. Hidradenomas are called generally by definition benign. Their malignant transformations and metastasis are seen very rarely. In veterinary literature database, the malignant form of tumor has been defined as an unique report in four dogs. They are extremely rare tumors in dogs. It is not documented within multiple tumor complex up to now.Case: In the case, three tumors were detected in a 9-year-old neutered female German shepherd dog. After clinical examination, a complete surgical resection of all masses was performed and masses were sent to Pathology for diagnosis. A mass on the right last rib was a 8x6 cm in diameters with severe ulceration. The mass had a hard texture, immobility and irregular borders. Other masses were localized on the back and left caudo-abdominal mammary lobe. Tumors on the back and the mammary lobe did not invade muscle layer, but the tumor on the last rib aggressively invaded surrounding tissue and were very difficult to remove surgically After macroscopy, all the masses were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), Mayers mucicarmine and Periodic Acid Shiff (PAS) stainings. In the first mass, there were multilobular epithelial islands between prominent fibrous septa from the upper to deep of dermis. The neoplastic cells were generally round or polyhedral in shape. Some of cytoplasms were eosinophilic at different degree. But cytoplasms were generally finely granular and vesicular or clear in appearance. Some cells had possible glycogen deposits. Nucleus was oval to round and had fine reticular chromatin and a distinct nucleolus.[...](AU)

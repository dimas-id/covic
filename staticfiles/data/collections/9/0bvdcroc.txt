COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has constituted a pandemic unparalleled in modern history. The spread, case numbers, and socioeconomic consequences have resulted in pandemic control measures attempting to "flatten the curve". Australia recorded its first case of COVID-19 on the 25th of January 2020. The federal government responded to the virus spread by escalating human movement controls: during February any person arriving from countries with high rates of infection were expected to quarantine for 14 days in a third country before entering Australia.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is a key component of therapy for acute coronary syndromes managed with and without percutaneous coronary intervention. Recent advances have given patients a wider variety of therapeutic options including the use of combinations of agents, dosing strategies, and durations of therapy. The optimal regimen minimizes thrombotic risk without increasing the risk of bleeding. Choosing the best therapy for each patient is an individualized dilemma that requires new, evidence-based tools to support regimen decision-making.

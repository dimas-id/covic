Abstract COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world. One of the principle preventive strategies is practicing social distancing. Congregations of the faithful at local and transnational level are strongly recommended by several world religions and religious orders. Gathering of large number of people in close approximation could be a fertile ground for the spread of novel pathogens. The refusal to suspend such gatherings could lead to potential widespread dispersal of infections.

It is an undeniable fact that material handling systems aim at supplying the right materials at the right locations at the right time. This fact creates the need for the design of logistic-train-fleet-oriented, distributed and scalability-robust control policies ensuring deadlock-free operations. The paper presents a solution to a multi-item and multi-depot vehicle routing and scheduling problem subject to fuzzy pick-up and delivery transportation time constraints. Since this type of problem can be treated as a fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem, a solution to it can be determined using both computer simulation and analytical ordered-fuzzy-numbers-driven calculations. The accuracy of both approaches is verified based on the results of multiple simulations. In this context, our contribution consists of proposing an alternative approach that allows avoiding time-consuming computer simulation-based calculations of logistic train fleet schedules.

In the midst of rising positive cases of COVID-19, the hospitals face a newfound difficulty to prioritize on their patients and accommodate them. Moreover, crowding of patients at hospitals pose a threat to the healthcare workers and other patients at the hospital. With that in mind, a non-contact method of measuring the necessary vitals such as heart rate, respiratory rate and SPO$_2$ will prove highly beneficial for the hospitals to tackle this issue. This paper discusses our approach in achieving the non-contact measurement of vitals with the sole help of a webcam and further our design of an e-hospital platform for doctors and patients to attend appointments virtually. The platform also provides the doctor with an option to provide with voice-based prescriptions or digital prescriptions, to simplify the daily, exhausting routine of a doctor.

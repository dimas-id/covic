Patients with unresectable esophageal cancer suffer from dysphagia, causing severe malnutrition and reduced quality of life (QOL). We elect to perform bypass because patients can have greater long-term survival with chemoradiation following this operation. We sought to compare complications in cases of bypass without thoracotomy versus those with thoracotomy. Thirty-four locally advanced esophageal cancer patients between 2007 and 2014 were studied. Eighteen patients underwent thoracotomy, and 16 patients did not have a thoracotomy. CT was obtained to check the anastomosis and the oral stump of the esophagus and to measure the diameter of the intrathoracic esophagus. In the thoracotomy group, the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications was high. On the other hand, in the non-thoracotomy group, the rates of anastomotic leak and recurrent nerve paralysis were high. The stump of the esophagus was 2 cm lower in the T group than in the nT group. As the esophagus shortens after division, the final difference in esophageal height between the groups was only around 1 cm. We concluded that a viable gastric tube with a good blood supply as well as a careful cervical operation are the most important aspects of the esophageal bypass operation.

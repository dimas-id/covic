The macroPARPs Parp‐9 and Parp‐14 are macro domain containing poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerases involved in transcriptional regulation in response to immunoregulatory cytokines. Their genes reside in the same locus (16B3), and the Parp‐9 gene lies head‐to‐head and shares its promoter with the gene encoding its partner, Bbap. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of Parp‐9, Parp‐14, and Bbap expression during mouse development and adulthood. Parp‐9 is developmentally regulated, and prominently expressed in the thymus and specific regions of the brain and gut. In adults, highest expression is maintained in the thymus and intestine. Parp‐14 is more weakly expressed, mainly in the thymus during development and in adulthood. In addition, we show that Bbap is essentially coexpressed with Parp‐9 during development and in adult mouse. However, the different levels of their transcripts detected in the developing brain and gut suggest that Bbap and Parp‐9 display both common and independent tissue‐specific regulations.

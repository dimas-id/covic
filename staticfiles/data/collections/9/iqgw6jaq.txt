SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the United States, causing extensive morbidity and mortality, though the histopathologic basis of severe disease cases has yet to be studied in detail. Over the past century, autopsy has contributed significantly to our understanding of numerous disease processes, but for several reasons, autopsy reports following deaths related to SARS-CoV-2 have thus far been limited across the globe. We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in the first series of autopsies in the United States, with the cause of death being due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These cases identify key pathologic states potentially contributing to severe disease and decompensation in these patients.

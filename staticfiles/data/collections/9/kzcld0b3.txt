UNLABELLED The pharmacokinetics of the tricarbonyl core radiopharmaceutical (99m)Tc(CO)3-nitrilotriacetic acid ((99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA)) in rats and subjects with normal renal function are comparable to those of (131)I-o-iodohippuran ((131)I-OIH), the radiopharmaceutical gold standard for the measurement of effective renal plasma flow. Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of these 2 tracers in subjects with renal failure. METHODS (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) was prepared with commercially available NTA and a commercially available labeling kit and isolated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Approximately 74 MBq (2.0 mCi) of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) were coinjected with approximately 11.1 MBq (300 μCi) of (131)I-OIH in 8 subjects with stage 3-4 renal failure; simultaneous images were obtained for 24 min, followed by an anterior image over the gallbladder and abdomen. Plasma clearances were determined from 10 blood samples obtained 3-180 min after injection using the single-injection, 2-compartment model. Plasma protein binding, red cell uptake, and percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 and 180 min were determined. RESULTS There was no difference in the plasma clearances of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) and (131)I-OIH (177 ± 63 vs. 171 ± 66 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively) (P = 0.41). The plasma protein binding and red cell uptake of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) were 35% ± 7% and 6% ± 3%, respectively; both values were significantly lower than the plasma protein binding (71% ± 5%) and red cell uptake (16% ± 2%) of (131)I-OIH (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage injected dose in the urine at 30 min (P = 0.24) and at 3 h (P = 0.82); for comparison, the percentage dose in the urine at 3 h was 77% ± 9% for (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) and 78% ± 11% for (131)I-OIH. Image quality with (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) was excellent and no activity was identified in the gallbladder or intestine. CONCLUSION Results in patients with renal failure show the clearance and rate of urine excretion of (99m)Tc(CO)3(NTA) to be equivalent to that of (131)I-OIH.

Viral infections still threaten human health all over the world, and many people die from viral diseases every year. However, there are no effective vaccines or drugs for preventing or managing most viral diseases. Thus, the discovery and development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents remain urgent. Here, we expressed and purified a venom peptide, Ev37, from the scorpion Euscorpiops validus in a prokaryotic system. We found that rEv37 can inhibit dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections in a dose-dependent manner at noncytotoxic concentrations, but that it has no effect on Sendai virus (SeV) and adenovirus (AdV) infections in vitro Furthermore, rEv37 alkalized acidic organelles to prevent low pH-dependent fusion of the viral membrane-endosomal membrane, which mainly blocks the release of the viral genome from the endosome to the cytoplasm and then restricts viral late entry. Taken together, our results indicate that the scorpion venom peptide Ev37 is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent with a specific molecular mechanism against viruses undergoing low pH-dependent fusion activation during entry into host cells. We conclude that Ev37 is a potential candidate for development as an antiviral drug.

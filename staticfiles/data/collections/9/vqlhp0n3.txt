In this study incisional hernia repairs at a single UK institution between 1994 and 2008 were analyzed with respect to short-term and long-term results. Prospectively collected data were analyzed retrospectively to ascertain outcomes, complications, and recurrences. Two hundred and twenty-seven operations were performed with 35% of the operations being for recurrent hernias. A self-centering suture technique was used. Median operating time was 55 minutes. There were 8 conversions and median hospital stay was 1 night. There were 52 complications (23%) including 3 postoperative bleeds, 3 mesh infections, and 4 small bowel obstructions. Median postoperative follow-up was 53 months. There were 25 recurrences (11%) being detected, a median of 17 months after initial operation. In this large series, laparoscopic incisional hernia repair is safe and is associated with a short hospital stay. Recurrences after repair remain a concern prompting the development of strategies to try and minimize the likelihood of this occurring.

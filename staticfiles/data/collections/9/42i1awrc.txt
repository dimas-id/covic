We report two cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in infants presenting with fever in the absence of respiratory distress who required hospitalization for evaluation of possible invasive bacterial infections. The diagnoses resulted from routine isolation and real-time RT-PCR-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 for febrile infants in an outbreak setting.

On human lung parenchymal explants, chloroquine concentration clinically achievable in the lung (100 ÂµM) inhibited the lipopolysaccharide-induced release of TNF-&#945; (by 76%), IL-6 (by 68%), CCL2 (by 72%) and CCL3 (by 67%). Beside its antiviral activity, chloroquine might also mitigate the cytokine storm associated with severe pneumonia caused by coronaviruses.

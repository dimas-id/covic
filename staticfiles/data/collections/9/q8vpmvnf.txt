More men than women have died from COVID-19. Genes encoded on X chromosomes, and sex hormones may explain the decreased fatality of COVID-19 in women. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 gene is located on X chromosomes. Men, with a single X chromosome, may lack the alternative mechanism for cellular protection after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Some Toll-like receptors encoded on the X chromosomes can sense SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, leading to a stronger innate immunity response in women. Both estrogen and estrogen receptor-&#945; contribute to T cell activation. Interventional approaches including estrogen-related compounds and androgen receptor antagonists may be considered in patients with COVID-19.

Astroviruses are important pathogens of human beings and animals. Feline astroviruses have been identified by electron microscopy in the feces of either asymptomatic or symptomatic cats, and experimental infection with one isolate was shown to induce enteric clinical signs and virus excretion, thus suggesting a possible role as enteric pathogen. However, due to the lack of specific diagnostic assays, feline astroviruses are not included in the diagnostic algorithms of feline infectious diseases, and their role as feline pathogens remains unclear. The present report describes a dual infection by Feline astrovirus and Feline panleukopenia virus in a 4-month-old cat with severe gastroenteritis and panleukopenia. Upon sequence analysis, the Feline astrovirus strain was found to be genetically related to astroviruses identified in human beings and felids.

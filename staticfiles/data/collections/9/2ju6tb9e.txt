An unexpected biodistribution of nebulized Tc-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid was detected after the ventilation of a patient referred for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Radiochemical purity testing of the stock vial showed more than 95% labelling. Further investigation indicated that the problem was possibly associated with a cleaning agent used for the nebulizer, leading to the dissociation of the Tc-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid. Manufacturer's instructions for cleaning of the nebulizer specify the use of 70% denatured ethanol solution, but a chlorine-based agent had been used inadvertently.

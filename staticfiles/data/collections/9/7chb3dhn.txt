Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is considered one of the telltale signs of a terminal malignant process. We describe a successful endovascular desobliteration of a subtotal occluded SVC and the left innominate vein using a Y-stent technique in a 46-year-old female with a mediastinal nodal metastasis of a relapsing renal cell carcinoma. Complete clinical improvement in the symptoms within the first 24 hours of the procedure and no complication were observed. This report describes endovascular stenting of the SVC as a palliation therapy to overcome the severe clinical symptoms of SVCS besides surgical or chemotherapy in mediastinal malignancy masses.

Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has spread all over the world.1 To date, few reports regarding the cutaneous involvement in COVID-19 have been published.2,3 Herein, we report a four cases series describing skin lesions probably related with COVID-19. The case 1 was a 66-year-old Caucasian female with a history of hypertension and dyslipidaemia. When hospitalized, she showed fever, nasal congestion and pneumonia symptoms. A chest-TC displayed bilateral interstitial lungs' involvement and a nasopharyngeal-swab confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. At day 6 of hospitalization, an asymptomatic erythematous-pomphoid skin rash occurred on the trunk (Figure 1A).

An uncertain world due to the Covid-19 pandemic embarks the publishers to find the best solution when designing the digital textbook to meet the student’s new norms. Therefore, understanding the theories of user acceptance and adoption of technology is very critical. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the existing literature on the theory used for exploring the acceptance and adoption of digital textbooks among students. Thirty-two studies guided by PRISMA’s statement of Preferred Reporting Articles for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis were acknowledged for the systematic evaluation of Scopus and Web of Science databases. This work provided two main contributions. First, the study delivered condensed information on the theory used in the acceptance and adoption of digital textbook usage which will guide the publishers to consider when designing the digital textbook. Second, the results provided insights into the relevance of a new aspect for future research in the digital textbook context.

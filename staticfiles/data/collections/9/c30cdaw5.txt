Astrocytes possess a concentrativel-ascorbate (vitamin C) uptake mechanism involving a Na(+)-dependentl-ascorbate transporter located in the plasma membrane. The present experiments examined the effects of deprivation and supplementation of extracellularl-ascorbate on the activity of this transport system. Initial rates ofl-ascorbate uptake were measured by incubating primary cultures of rat astrocytes withl-[(14)C]ascorbate for 1 min at 37Â°C. We observed that the apparent maximal rate of uptake (V (max)) increased rapidly (<1 h) when cultured cells were deprived ofl-ascorbate. In contrast, there was no change in the apparent affinity of the transport system forl-[(14)C]ascorbate. The increase inV (max) was reversed by addition ofl-ascorbate, but notD-isoascorbate, to the medium. The effects of external ascorbate on ascorbate transport activity were specific in that preincubation of cultures withl-ascorbate did not affect uptake of 2-deoxy-D-[(3)H(G)]glucose. We conclude that the astroglial ascorbate transport system is modulated by changes in substrate availability. Regulation of transport activity may play a role in intracellular ascorbate homeostasis by compensating for regional differences and temporal fluctuations in external ascorbate levels.

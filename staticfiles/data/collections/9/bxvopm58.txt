Abstract The chapters in this textbook deal with those viruses causing human disease, and the various modes of replication, transmission, and disease-causing processes that contribute to a particular clinical presentation. This final chapter focuses on each of the major clinical syndromes and outlines the contribution of particular viruses to each one, thereby serving as a pointer to elsewhere among earlier chapters where more specific information can be found. These virusâ€“disease associations have been presented in tabular form for ease of reference.

Tumours close to the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) are difficult to excise due to high risk of complications. Laparoscopic and endoscopic combined surgery allows minimally invasive access while increasing tumour visualization. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of a 68-year-old female demonstrated a lesion suspicious of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour located 2 cm from the OGJ on the posterior gastric wall. Stapled excision was performed intragastrically and followed by endoscopic removal. Gastroscopy 7 months post-op and follow-up CT scan at 5 years demonstrated no recurrence of the primary tumour and no new disease. Laparoscopic and endoscopic combined approach is a safe and effective method of removing tumours close to the OGJ.

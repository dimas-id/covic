Continuous hemodiafiltration using a hemofilter made from a membrane with cytokine adsorption properties is thought to be effective to remove cytokines in septic patients. In order to enhance cytokine removal capacity by increasing adsorption area, we devised a double polymethyl methacrylate continuous hemodiafiltration method, which involves serial connection of two polymethyl methacrylate membrane hemofilters, and we report clinical efficacy with this method. Of 74 patients who underwent continuous hemodiafiltration and had interleukin-6 blood levels measured during their ICU stay between March 2010 and June 2012, 13 patients with hypercytokinemia (interleukin-6 blood level >900 pg/mL) underwent series double continuous hemodiafiltration to be treated for hypercytokinemia. Cytokine reduction rate and clinical efficacy were compared between those 13 patients and those with a similar pathological condition who underwent continuous hemodiafiltration using the single polymethyl methacrylate membrane hemofilter. Interleukin-6 blood levels 6 h after continuous hemodiafiltration initiation increased in the single continuous hemodiafiltration group from 17040 ± 33660 pg/mL to 26290 ± 66250 pg/mL; however, interleukin-6 blood level significantly decreased in the series double continuous hemodiafiltration group from 20220 ± 29120 pg/mL to 6790 ± 10820 pg/mL. Interleukin-6 reduction rate during the period between initiation and 6 h after initiation of continuous hemodiafiltration was significantly higher in the series double continuous hemodiafiltration group(63.5 ± 38.9%) compared to that of the single continuous hemodiafiltration group (-342 ± 1306%)(P = 0.039). Series double continuous hemodiafiltration using two polymethyl methacrylate hemofilters with cytokine adsorbing capacity is effective to remove cytokine in hypercytokinemic septic patients.

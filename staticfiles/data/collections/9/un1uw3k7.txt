Abstract We studied the effects of human activity on concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols in indoor air environments. We conducted measurement experiments for concentrations of bioaerosols and aerosol particles in test chambers with people performing various activities inside. We found that the number of people and human activities had positive correlations with the concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols. However, the concentration of fungal bioaerosols was not influenced by human presence or activities. The findings regarding the concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols and the effects of human presence and activities will be useful for studying control methods against bioaerosols.

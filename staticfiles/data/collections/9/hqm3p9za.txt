Abstract Feed for livestock animals have been under increased scrutiny as a vector for pathogenic bacteria leading to human illnesses. Control of these pathogenic bacteria in animal feeds can be controlled via physical and chemical means. Physical methods can include thermal processing, including irradiation, pelleting, and extrusion. Chemical mitigation can be accomplished through the inclusion of various additives, including formaldehyde, organic acids, essential oils, or medium chain fatty acids. While physical and chemical interventions can help mitigate risk of pathogens contaminating finished animal feeds, the implementation of a biosecurity plan at the feed mill can help prevent pathogens from entering or spreading throughout the facility.

OBJECTIVES It is difficult to introduce laparoscopic surgery in institutions with a small number of patients, and surgical training relies heavily on mentors to produce well-trained surgeons. The aim of this study was to determine whether implementation of a hands-on mentorship model could provide safe skill transfer for transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. METHODS A trainee who had no experience with TAPP repair underwent operative tutorials until the mentor judged that the trainee could carry out the operation independently. Ten patients who underwent an elective TAPP repair were prospectively enrolled in this study. RESULTS No cases had over 5 mL of bleeding, intraoperative/postoperative complications, or recurrence. There were significant differences in operation times between the first 4 cases and the later 5 cases, except for a bilateral inguinal hernia case. CONCLUSION A prospective, single-arm, single-center, case series showed the feasibility of safe skill transfer for TAPP repair using a hands-on mentorship model.

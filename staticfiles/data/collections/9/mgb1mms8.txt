This final chapter reviews and considers speculations on economic and social development in the context of further automation and progress in artificial intelligence (AI). First, it discusses two possible extreme sets of economic consequences: one being a dystopian scenario with high inequality and deprivation among large swaths of society and the other being “The Happy Leisure Society,” in which most people benefit from the new technologies. We move on to elaborate on the potential effects of automation and AI on living arrangements and the design of cities. Finally, we discuss the possibility of human augmentation to stay competitive with robots in the age of automation and where these trends could possibly lead. This chapter aims mainly to create awareness of these possibilities and to stimulate corresponding discussion—not to sketch a future we think will unfold.

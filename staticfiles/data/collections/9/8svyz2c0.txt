The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ingestion of pasteurized and subsequently frozen–thawed pooled colostrum (≥50 mg Ig/mL) with different bacterial counts and immunoglobulin concentration (IgC) on the occurrence of diarrhea and pneumonia in 306 neonatal Holstein calves in a hot environment. Calves were assigned to be fed colostrum with total bacterial counts (TBC) lower or greater than 100 000 colony‐forming units (cfu)/mL, total coliform counts (TCC) greater or lower than 10 000 cfu/mL, and IgC lower or higher than 85 mg Ig/mL. Calves fed colostrum with TBC ≥100 000 cfu/mL were more likely (risk ratio 1.34, confidence interval 1.05–1.71; P < 0.05) to present pneumonia than calves receiving colostrum with lower TBC (incidence 53.2 vs. 39.8%). Calves fed colostrum with high TCC had increased chances of suffering pneumonia (51.4 vs. 42.1%; P < 0.05) than calves fed colostrum with lower TCC. Calves fed colostrum with ≥85 mg Ig/mL tended to present higher daily weight gain (505 ± 113 vs. 484 ± 126 g; P = 0.09). TBC and TCC in colostrum did not influence the incidence rate of diarrhea. It was concluded that under the conditions of the present study, heavy contamination of on‐farm pasteurized frozen–thawed colostrum is seemingly unavoidable and this contamination poses a threat for pneumonia, but not for diarrhea.

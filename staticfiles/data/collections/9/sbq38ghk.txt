Single-incisional laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has emerged as an attempt to further enhance the cosmetic benefits and reduce the morbidity of minimally invasive surgery. We present an approach of SILS adhesiolysis to adhesive strangulated ileus. A 70-year-old female patient, who had undergone laparoscopic low anterior resection 6 years before, underwent SILS adhesiolysis to a midline surgical incision wound adhesion site. The surgery was performed with only a 2.5-cm left-side transrectus incision using the SILS port. Laparoscopy revealed intestinal torsion and congestion with adhesion of the ileum to the previous surgical incision wound. SILS adhesiolysis was successfully carried out. The patient was discharged 4 days after surgery. SILS adhesiolysis is a feasible and efficient procedure in certain cases.

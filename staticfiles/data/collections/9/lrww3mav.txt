Surgeons can choose from a wide selection of commercially available suture brands, which come at a range of prices. There is currently limited evidence in the literature to guide this selection process. This investigation examined the breaking force, stress, and elongation of a variety of commercially available nylon sutures compared to their relative prices. Seven 5-0, nonabsorbable, nylon suture brands were tensile tested in straight, knotted and knot-security configurations according to the procedures outlined by the United States Pharmacopeia for the tensile testing of sutures. Covidien, the cheapest brand tested, had the highest failure load of straight and knot-security tests. Dafilon was found to have the highest breaking force and percent elongation of knot-pull tests. J&J Ethicon and Supramid had the highest percent elongation to failure for straight-pull and knot-security tests, respectively. This study was limited to specific in vitro tensile properties of nylon suture. Other factors affecting suture quality and price, such as needle properties, were not investigated. The data presented in the study provide information for guiding the selection and purchase of sutures according to tensile properties. Â© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

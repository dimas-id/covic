In March, a team of scientists reported that they had run and analyzed a computational screen that helped them pinpoint 69 compounds that might treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 They now have new data from lab experiments showing that some of those compounds can stop the virus from replicating in cells The hits include a cancer drug currently in clinical trials, an over-the-counter antihistamine, and a compound that’s never been tested in humans but outperformed hydroxychloroquine in the cell studies (Nature 2020, DOI: 10 1038/s41586-020-2286-9) The international group, led by molecular biologist Nevan Krogan of the University of California, San Francisco, identified the original 69 compounds by running a screen to look for human proteins that might interact with the virus’s proteins The program then searched for molecules that could disrupt those potential interactions

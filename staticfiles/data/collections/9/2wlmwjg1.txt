This article highlights some of current state-of-the-art applications of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology pertaining to the musculoskeletal soft tissues. The rationale for the use of these techniques is to provide modes of minimally invasive diagnosis and/or therapy for a subset of patients whose lesions are not approachable by the traditional modes of interventional radiology and to introduce methods to mark subtle and infiltrative lesions to improve the outcomes of subsequent surgery or radiation therapy. These techniques build on the inherent attributes of MRI, particularly the high soft tissue contrast that made MRI the current mainstay diagnostic modality to identify and characterize musculoskeletal soft tissue lesions. The application of MRI technology to the musculoskeletal system, particularly for lesions related to the appendicular skeleton, does not typically suffer from the complexity related to involuntary organ motion. In addition, MRI-compatible versions of most of the needed instruments and devices for these interventions are currently available on commercial basis. Although musculoskeletal applications were not adopted early during the development of interventional MRI technology, we are likely to observe an increasing use of this technology for musculoskeletal soft tissue applications in the future.

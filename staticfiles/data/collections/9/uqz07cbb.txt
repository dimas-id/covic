Abstract Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious disease of small ruminants that leads to high morbidity and mortality thereby results in devastating economic consequences to the livestock industry. PPR is currently endemic across most parts of Asia and Africa, the two regions with the highest concentration of poor people in the world. Sheep and goats in particularly contribute significantly towards the upliftment of livelihood of the poor and marginal farmers in these regions. In this context, PPR directly affecting the viability of sheep and goat husbandry has emerged as a major hurdle in the development of these regions. The control of PPR in these regions could significantly contribute to poverty alleviation, therefore, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) have targeted the control and eradication of PPR by 2030 a priority. In order to achieve this goal, a potent, safe and efficacious live-attenuated PPR vaccine with long-lasting immunity is available for immunoprophylaxis. However, the live-attenuated PPR vaccine is thermolabile and needs maintenance of an effective cold chain to deliver into the field. In addition, the infected animals cannot be differentiated from vaccinated animals. To overcome these limitations, some recombinant vaccines have been developed. This review comprehensively describes about the latest developments in PPR vaccines.

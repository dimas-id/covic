Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are being recognized as important regulators of host innate immunity. However, specific TRIMs that contribute to TLR3-mediated antiviral defense have not been identified. We show here that TRIM56 is a positive regulator of TLR3 signaling. Overexpression of TRIM56 substantially potentiated extracellular dsRNA-induced expression of interferon (IFN)-β and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), while knockdown of TRIM56 greatly impaired activation of IRF3, induction of IFN-β and ISGs, and establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3 ligand and severely compromised TLR3-mediated chemokine induction following infection by hepatitis C virus. The ability to promote TLR3 signaling was independent of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM56. Rather, it correlated with a physical interaction between TRIM56 and TRIF. Deletion of the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 abrogated the TRIM56-TRIF interaction as well as the augmentation of TLR3-mediated IFN response. Together, our data demonstrate TRIM56 is an essential component of the TLR3 antiviral signaling pathway and reveal a novel role for TRIM56 in innate antiviral immunity.

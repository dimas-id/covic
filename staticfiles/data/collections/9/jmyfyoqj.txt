After three decades of development, the baculovirus/insect cell expression system is now recognized as a powerful platform for recombinant protein production. With a number of distinct advantages, the baculovirus/insect cell expression system has been extensively used for the production of various vaccine candidates, and several human and veterinary vaccine products have been commercially available. In addition to insect cells, baculovirus is capable of entering a broad range of mammalian cells, lending itself to a promising gene delivery vehicle for antigen expression and display in vivo. The use of baculovirus for antigen expression and delivery has been reviewed in 2008. Rather than a critical evaluation, this paper aims to provide an update of the applications of baculovirus as an in vitro or in vivo antigen expression/delivery vehicle, with special focuses on developments and advances after 2008.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a disease that has newly emerged in the 21st century, and is both severe and highly contagious. SARS first surfaced in late 2002 and spread within a few months from its origin in Guandong province, China, to more than 30 countries (World Health Organization, 2003). In this review, several antiviral substances shown to be active in vitro will be introduced and summarized in the order of the virus' replication steps; that is, binding to cellular receptor, fusion and entry to the cells, viral RNA replication and transcription, protein processing and so on. The possible clinical use of several synthetic peptides, including those that mimic the S-binding domain, the HR2 fusion protein and SARS proteinase substrates, will be discussed. Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) and established drugs, such as interferons and HIV proteinase inhibitors, are also discussed in relation to anti-SARS clinical use.

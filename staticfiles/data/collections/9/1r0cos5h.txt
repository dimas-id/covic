BACKGROUND Effective repair of hernia is a difficult task. There have been many advances in hernia repair techniques over the past 50 years, but new strategies must be considered to enhance the success of herniorrhaphy. DISCUSSION At the 30th International Congress of the European Hernia Society, nine experts in hernia repair and experimental mesh evaluation participated in a roundtable discussion about today's unmet needs in hernia repair, including what constitutes an "ideal" hernia repair and the portfolio of "ideal" mesh prostheses. Defining characteristics of lightweight mesh, mesh alternatives, the surgeon's role in hernia repair, adverse events, the unmet requirements for today's hernia repair, and optimized animal models were among the topics discussed. CONCLUSION The ideal mesh's construction is still in progress, but greater understanding of its critical characteristics was explored. It is hoped that these suggestions will lead to the development of improved hernia treatments and a maximally effective portfolio of hernia mesh prostheses.

The blockade of immune checkpoint receptors has made great strides in the treatment of major cancers, including melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, renal, and lung cancer. However, the success rate of immune checkpoint blockade is still low and some cancers, such as microsatellite‐stable colorectal cancer, remain refractory to these treatments. This has prompted investigation into additional checkpoint receptors. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) is a checkpoint receptor expressed by a wide variety of immune cells as well as leukemic stem cells. Coblockade of Tim-3 and PD-1 can result in reduced tumor progression in preclinical models and can improve antitumor T-cell responses in cancer patients. In this review, we will discuss the basic biology of Tim-3, its role in the tumor microenvironment, and the emerging clinical trial data that point to its future application in the field of immune-oncology.

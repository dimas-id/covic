This chapter summarizes the structural features that govern the translation of viral mRNAs: where the synthesis of a protein starts and ends, how many proteins can be produced from one mRNA, and how efficiently. It focuses on the interplay between viral and cellular mRNAs and the translational machinery. That interplay, together with the intrinsic structure of viral mRNAs, determines the patterns of translation in infected cells. It also points out some possibilities for translational regulation that can only be glimpsed at present, but are likely to come into focus in the future. The mechanism of selecting the initiation site for protein synthesis appears to follow a single formula. The translational machinery displays a certain flexibility that is exploited more frequently by viral than by cellular mRNAs. Although some of the parameters that determine efficiency have been identified, how efficiently a given mRNA will be translated cannot be predicted by summing the known parameters.

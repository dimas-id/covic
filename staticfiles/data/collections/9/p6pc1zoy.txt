In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and the various subsequent changes and behavioral adjustments necessary in the educational field, two important articles were recently published in Anatomical Sciences Education (Franchi, 2020; Srinivasan, 2020). The first study (Franchi, 2020) reported the impact of the pandemic on human anatomy education in the United Kingdom. This article described from the perspective of a medical student how the lack of practical teaching with cadavers can adversely impact training and lead to losses for students.

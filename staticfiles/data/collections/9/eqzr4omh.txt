We report a family cluster of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which three members of the family were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at the same time, but the disease manifested differently among the three family members. We describe the clinical manifestations, disease progression, and treatment of wife and husband. We also analyze the daughter who was in close contact with patients with COVID-19 but was not infected.

INTRODUCTION Thermal ablation techniques have gradually replaced Babcock procedure in varicose vein treatment. AIM A comparative quantitative-qualitative analysis of complications and failure of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in a 5-year follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred ten adult participants with varicose veins clinical grade C2 to C6, treated for isolated great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV) insufficiency in a single lower extremity in 2009 to 2010, were enrolled and subdivided into EVLA (n = 56) and RFA (n = 54) groups. Both groups were compared for demography, disease stage, affected veins, perioperative, and postoperative complications as well as treatment efficacy. RESULTS The perioperative and postoperative complications were statistically insignificant. Treatment efficacy, expressed as the number of participants with recurrent varicosity and recanalization, was comparable in both groups. The clinically significant recanalization rate was 3.6% and 5.6% in EVLA and RFA groups, respectively. CONCLUSION Endovenous laser ablation and RFA for the management of lower extremity varicose vein offer comparable efficacy and safety in a 5-year follow-up.

Human toxocariasis is generally a benign, self-curing disease, and neurologic involvement is quite exceptional. In this study, we report a case of toxocariasis caused by ingestion of an unusual transport host, namely live slugs. The clinical picture comprised eosinophilic lung involvement with severe neurologic disorders in relation to vasculitis as well as retinal detachment.

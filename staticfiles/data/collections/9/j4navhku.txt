Conformance checking techniques are widely adopted to validate process executions against a set of constraints describing the expected behavior. However, most approaches adopt a crisp evaluation of deviations, with the result that small violations are considered at the same level of significant ones. Furthermore, in the presence of multiple data constraints the overall deviation severity is assessed by summing up each single deviation. This approach easily leads to misleading diagnostics; furthermore, it does not take into account userâ€™s needs, that are likely to differ depending on the context of the analysis. We propose a novel methodology based on the use of aggregation functions, to assess the level of deviation severity for a set of constraints, and to customize the tolerance to deviations of multiple constraints.

INTRODUCTION Currently, laparoscopic surgery (LS) is a widely accepted surgical treatment for inguinal hernias, and it has major advantages, especially for recurrent cases. PRESENTATION OF CASE We diagnosed the recurrent inguinal hernia after wound infection and performed the laparosocopic approach. We would like to introduce our method. We distinguished between the presence and absence of bilateral inguinal hernia with an intra-abdominal scope using the transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP) technique, which we call laparoscopic examination. Thus, we can distinguish between the types of inguinal hernias and whether they are bilateral or not. We dissected the Retzius space on the inside of an epigastric arteriovenous fistula as part of TEP part A, and dissection was performed without a balloon. We separated and dissected the Retzius space. We also performed lateral dissection of the preperitoneal space. We made an incision in the peritoneum at the inner groin ring (hernia sac). We isolated the cord structures (parietalization) using TAPP. We finally checked this operation from the abdominal space (TAPP filed) and determined whether the repair was satisfactorily completed or not. DISCUSSION Our hybrid method is not special but the conventional laparoscopic approach adapted each merits both TAPP and TEP. CONCLUSION Our method is effective for difficult recurrent inguinal hernias.

We report on label-free immunosensors for the highly sensitive detection of avian influenza virus. The method makes use of the microcantilevers of an atomic force microscope onto which monoclonal antibodies against avian influenza virus were covalently immobilized. The factors influencing the performance of the resulting immunosensors were optimized by measuring the deflections of the cantilever via optical reflection, and this resulted in low detection limits and a wide analytical range. The differential deflection signals revealed specific antigen binding and their intensity is proportional to the logarithm of the concentrations of the virus in solution. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensors exhibit a linear response in the 7.6 ng mL(−1) to 76 μg mL(−1) concentration range of avian influenza virus, and the detection limit is 1.9 ng mL(−1).

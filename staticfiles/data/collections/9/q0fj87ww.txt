Tears of peroneus brevis tendon represent a cause of underdiagnosed lateral ankle pain and instability. The typical clinical presentation is retro-malleolar pain, in some cases associated with palpable swelling around the fibular malleolus, pain during activities and difficulty in walking. We present a case of peroneus brevis split lesion with superior peroneal retinaculum avulsion in a young athlete who referred to the emergency ward of our hospital for left ankle pain after an inversion injury. An early diagnosis allowed treating the injury and promptly resuming sport activity, after rehabilitation training. Surgical reconstruction key-points and post-surgical follow-up were also discussed. A late diagnosis would have caused a symptomatology worsening and an increased recovery time.

The authors report on a rapid and direct visual test for the detection of influenza A virus using a carbon nanotag based lateral flow assay. Carbon nanoparticles in the form of nanostrings are acting as reporters. As carbon nanotags accumulate in the test zone due to formation of an antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex, and this allows for the direct visualization of the analytical signal. Under optimal conditions, influenza A virus can be determined in allantoic fluid inoculated with the virus with a limit of detection of 350 TCID(50).mL(âˆ’1) (i.e., the 50% tissue culture infectious dose). No interference is found for several other tested proteins, and for closely related viruses. Cell lysates containing different seasonal strains of influenza A viruses (including the H1N1 and H3N2 strains) collected from clinical samples were analyzed. It is demonstrated that the method can detect both influenza A viruses without interference by biological matrices. In our perception, this method has a wide potential in that it may be extended to a generally applicable platform for rapid diagnosis influenza A viruses.

OBJECTIVES This study prospectively evaluates the impact of the Haga Braincare Strategy (HBS) on the occurrence of haemodynamic and embolic stroke in a cohort of patients who underwent coronay artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve replacement of a combination of both types of surgery between 2012 and 2015 at the Haga Teaching Hospitals. METHODS The HBS is a dual strategy based on a preoperative vascular work-up of the cerebral circulation by transcranial Doppler and a perioperative monitoring of the cerebral circulation by cerebral oximetry. Duplex of the carotid arteries and/or computed tomography angiography prior to surgery was performed in high-risk patients. Patients with severe carotid artery stenosis were scheduled for carotid angioplasty prior to surgery or waived from surgery. RESULTS A total of 1065 patients were included. Poor cerebral haemodynamics were identified by transcranial Doppler in 2.1% of patients (n = 22). Based on the HBS, 3 patients were waived from surgery, 4 received preoperative carotid angioplasty followed by cardiac surgery and the remaining patients were operated while being monitored with bilateral cerebral oximetry sensors. In all, 2.2% of the study group experienced a stroke (n = 23), of which none were classified as haemodynamic. Most of the remaining presumed embolic strokes showed a minor to moderate stroke severity. CONCLUSIONS In this single-centre prospective follow-up study, surveillance of cerebral perfusion by the HBS eliminated the occurrence of haemodynamic stroke while most of the residual strokes had a good to favourable prognosis.

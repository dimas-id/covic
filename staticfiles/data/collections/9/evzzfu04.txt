Abstract Outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) have become considerable threats to the health of infants and young children. To identify the cellular long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in the host response to EV71 infection, we performed comprehensive lncRNA and mRNA profiling in EV71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma cells through microarray. We observed the differential expression of more than 4800 lncRNAs during infection. Further analysis showed 160 regulated enhancer-like lncRNA and nearby mRNA pairs, as well as 313 regulated Rinn’s lncRNA [M. Guttman I. Amit, M. Garber, C. French, M.F. Lin, D. Feldser, M. Huarte, O.

The results provided information for further research on the prevention and treatment of EV71 infection, as well as on distinguishing severe and mild EV71 cases.

Pathogenicity is a complex process with stringent requirements of both the host cell and the infecting virion. Among these requirements are a port of entry into host cells, a means of replication for the virus, and a means by which infection damages host cells. Damage to the host can result from multiple mechanisms including transformation, suppression of cellular metabolism, apoptosis, autoimmune responses directed against infected or uninfected tissues, or by molecular mimicry. In the attempt to identify new associations between viral infection and disease, investigators should be mindful that variable host factors as well as viral infection may be required for pathogenesis. Efforts to associate specific viral infections with specific diseases may be obscured by final common pathways through which multiple agents damage host cells in similar ways.

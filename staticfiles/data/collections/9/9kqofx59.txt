BACKGROUND: Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and red wine, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. However, relatively little is known about whether resveratrol modulates the ion channels in cortical neurons. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK(Ca) currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. RESULTS: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK(Ca) channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK(Ca) channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK(Ca) channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK(Ca) channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels. CONCLUSIONS: As BK(Ca) channels and sodium channels are critical molecular determinants for seizure generation, our findings suggest that regulation of these two channels in cortical neurons probably makes a considerable contribution to the antiseizure activity of resveratrol.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW There has been a significant increase in the number and types of procedures performed outside of the operating room with nonanesthesia providers administering sedation. This review describes current recommendations for training nonanesthesiologists involved in administering deep sedation, summarizes best practices and highlights select patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS There are numerous guidelines and standards related to the administration of deep sedation. However, there are no universally accepted guidelines regarding the necessary educational and skill competencies needed for nonanesthesiologists to provide deep sedation. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has published a position statement and guidelines on these educational requirements, yet the extent to which these are adhered to remains unknown. As evidence-based guidelines continue to evolve, more research is needed to describe how current practices affect patient outcomes. SUMMARY The American Society of Anesthesiologists publishes recommendations regarding the essential educational components for nonanesthesiologist providers who administer deep sedation. The available data support the need for formal educational programmes to prevent adverse events associated with deep sedation. Competencies should include preprocedural evaluation, understanding sedation levels, airway management, documentation, emergency life support skills, teamwork and quality improvement.

OBJECTIVE Sacrocolpopexy (SCP) is the gold standard for apical prolapse treatment. However, the technical performance of each SCP is strongly dependent on the surgeon's own discretion and comparison of clinical outcomes with respect to urinary incontinence (UI) is difficult. We developed a comprehensible laparoscopic surgical technique for the treatment of apical prolapse with UI. METHODS A total of 120 women with UI underwent laparoscopic bilateral SCP for apical prolapse. Thereby, the uterosacral ligaments (USLs) were bilaterally replaced by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) tapes of identical length and shape, which were fixed at defined anatomical landmarks (cervix/vaginal vault and S1). RESULTS The restoration of apical vaginal support was achieved in 116 patients (97%); restoration failed in the first 4 patients owing to the use of fast-absorbable sutures. Seventy-eight patients (65%) with mixed and urgency UI symptoms before surgery achieved continence. The mean hospitalization was 3 days; no major complications were observed intraoperatively. CONCLUSION The advantage of laparoscopic cervicosacropexy (laCESA) and laparoscopic vaginosacropexy (laVASA) lies in the comprehensible surgical technique (clearly defined technique) and the minimal amount of material used (no polypropylenes). The possibility of a short operating time and short hospitalization depicts this laparoscopic bilateral USL replacement as one treatment alternative in patients with apical prolapse suffering from UI.

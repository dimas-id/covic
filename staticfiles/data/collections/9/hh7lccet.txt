BACKGROUND: There have been limited data regarding the clinical impact of COVID-19 disease on people with HIV (PWH). In this study we compared outcomes for PWH with COVID-19 disease to a matched comparison group. DESIGN: We identified 88 PWH hospitalized with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital system in New York between March 12 and April 23, 2020. We collected data on baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory values, HIV infection status, COVID-19 treatment, and outcomes from this group and matched comparators (one PWH to up to five patients by age, sex, race/ethnicity and calendar week of infection). We compared baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes (death, mechanical ventilation, hospital discharge) for these two groups, as well as cumulative incidence of death by HIV status. RESULTS: Patients did not differ significantly by HIV status by age, sex or race/ethnicity due to the matching algorithm. PWH hospitalized with COVID-19 had high proportions of HIV virologic control on antiretroviral therapy. PWH had greater proportions of smoking (p<0.001) and comorbid illness than demographically similar uninfected comparators. There was no difference in COVID-19 severity on admission by HIV status (p=0.15). Poor outcomes for hospitalized PWH were frequent but similar to proportions in comparators; 18% required mechanical ventilation and ultimately 21% died during follow-up (compared with 23% and 20% respectively). There was similar cumulative incidence of death over time by HIV status (p=0.94). INTERPRETATION: We found no differences in adverse outcomes associated with HIV infection for hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to a demographically similar patient group.

Abstract Cancer cells depend on cap-dependent translation more than normal tissue. This explains the emergence of proteins involved in the cap-dependent translation as targets for potential anticancer drugs. Cap-dependent translation starts when eIF4E binds to mRNA cap domain. This review will present eIF4E's structure and functions. It will also expose the use of eIF4E as a therapeutic target in cancer.

The world-wide COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted dental practice. Issues confronting practicing dentists include possible transmission of disease by droplets/ aerosol or contact with contaminated surfaces. Dentists are at increased risk due to their proximity to the oropharynx. In an effort to reduce potential exposure to aerosols generated during treatment, a device has been developed in which a polycarbonate shield is mounted to the dental operating microscope with an attached high velocity vacuum hose. Anemometer measurements demonstrate an exhaust outflow of 3.9 ft/min at a position approximating the patientâ€™s oropharynx. More research may be warranted using this or similar approaches to mitigate aerosol transmission.

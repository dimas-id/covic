Four states in India account for nearly two thirds of the Covid-19 cases and the numbers are growing fast. A mathematical model which has been recently developed and which has been applied to other countries and regions in the world has been used in this paper to anchor the available data to date and to make near term projections. The projections can be compared to actual data to take steps in the near term in controlling the spread of this disease. Key words: Coronavirus, Covid-19, SARS, Basu model, analysis, data, infectious disease, India, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, reopening, resurgence

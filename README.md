COVID-19 Information Center, or could be called as **covic** is a COVID-specialized search engine that could help you to solve your COVID-related problems! **covic** is here to help you answer your COVID-related questions!

**covic** was based on the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/index.html "CORD-19 Site"), a collection of biomedical literature articles, related to COVID-19 informations, that is updated regularly. [CORD-19](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/index.html "CORD-19 Site") was created based on TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) model that is mainly focused to evaluate search algorithms and systems for helping scientists, clinicians, policy makers, and others manage the existing and rapidly growing corpus of scientific literature related to COVID-19.

With the help of the provided [CORD-19](https://ir.nist.gov/covidSubmit/index.html "CORD-19 Site") dataset, **covic** aims to help people get their solutions for any of their COVID-related problems easily. Hopefully, **covic** could be your COVID helper in the future â™¥
